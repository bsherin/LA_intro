# Week 1 tasks

1. Take a stab at installing the environment on your local machine. ([Instructions](instructions/install_jupyter_notebook.md))
2. Go through the `Python Basics` and `Some first mining` notebooks that
we used in class. Just to get comfortable.
3. Work through Chapters 1-7 in "Python From the Very Beginning". Don't feel
like you have to do everything. Try what seems helpful.
