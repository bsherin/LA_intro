# Getting started with Tactic

Tactic lives at tactic.northwestern.edu. Chrome is the recommended browser.

I have created accounts for all of you. Your username is your netid. Your password is initially set to tm2021. After logging in, you can change
your password, if you want, by clicking on your netid at the top right.

(Even though we're using netids, your Tactic accounts aren't linked to your
university accounts in any way.)

The general documentation for Tactic is on the `Docs` link in the top bar.

The tabs down the lefthand side give you access to the different parts of
your Tactic resource library. If you second tab down from the top accesses
your "Projects", which includes the notebooks you'll be using. Click on that.
Once you're there you can double-click on a notebook to open it.
