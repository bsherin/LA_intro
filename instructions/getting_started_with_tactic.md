# Getting started with Tactic

## Logging in

Tactic lives at `tactic.northwestern.edu`. Chrome is the recommended browser.

I have created accounts for all of you.
  - Username: [your netid]
  - Pasword: tm2021

After logging in, you can change your password, if you want, by clicking on your netid at the right of the top navigation bar.

(Even though we're using netids, your Tactic accounts aren't linked to your
university accounts in any way.)

## Accessing the Notebooks
The tabs down the lefthand side give you access to the different parts of
your Tactic resource library. If you second tab down from the top accesses
your "Projects", which includes the notebooks you'll be using. Click on that.
Once you're there you can double-click on a notebook to open it.

## General Tactic Documentation
The general documentation for Tactic is at the `Docs` link in the top bar.
