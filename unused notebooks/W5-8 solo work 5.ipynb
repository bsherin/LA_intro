    "The text data you get will likely be embedded in some elaborate data structure. So you'll have to figure out how to fish it out and convert it into a data structure that you can work with, such as a list of strings, or a list of dictionaries. This won't be easy, and might require you to push your python understanding. But see if you can make progress. \n",

    "    * You can do this however you want. You can use nltk.tokenize, or one of the tokenizers we have used in the course.\n",
    "    * You can use your own regular expressions.\n",
    "    * You can use a combination.\n",
    "2. Construct a frequency distribution of the words in your little corpus.\n",
    "    * Take a look. What do you think?\n",
    "3. Remove words from a stop list and look at the frequency distribution again.\n",
