# Week 8 Tasks

1. Grab the new notebooks for this week. They are W8-1 through W8-4.
Also, one list "seasons_stop_list", has again been updated. Get that too.
2. Next week we'll (only) be discussing readings. There are three: [Bauer et al. 2017](https://github.com/bsherin/text_mining_content/blob/main/readings/Baumer2017.pdf), [Nelson, 2020](https://github.com/bsherin/text_mining_content/blob/main/readings/Nelson2020.pdf), and [Rosenberg & Krist, 2020](https://github.com/bsherin/text_mining_content/blob/main/readings/Rosenberg2020.pdf).
3. Work on your tool report (if you're not done).
4. Work on your own corpus. Ask Bruce for help.
5. Understand all things.
