# Week 7 Tasks

1. Grab the new notebooks for this week. They are W7-1 through W7-4.
Also, one list "seasons_stop_list", has been updated. Get that too.
2. There are two readings for this week, the one by [Landauer](https://github.com/bsherin/text_mining_content/blob/main/readings/Landauer1998.pdf) and my paper [here](https://github.com/bsherin/text_mining_content/blob/main/readings/Sherin2013.pdf).
3. Work on your tool report (if you're not done).
4. Work on your own corpus. Ask Bruce for help.
