## Tool Report Assignment

Your task is to give a brief report for us on what a tool or library does.
You can pick from the list [here](tools_and_libraries.md) or you can find one on your own.

These reports are informal. I don't know much, if anything, about any of these tools.
Your job is to give us the basics so that the rest of us can know if it's worth
digging in deeper. So you should include:

1. Tell us the basics:
  * What is this tool? What is it for?
  * Is it free? If not, how much does it cost?
  * What is the ecosystem like? Does it seem like a lot of people use this tool?
  * Does it seem like it's still under development?
2. Do some analyses and show them to us:
  * If it makes sense, replicate our Titanic classification analysis
  * If it makes sense, replicate our classification analysis of the Spam dataset.
  * If these don't make sense, do some analysis that does.
