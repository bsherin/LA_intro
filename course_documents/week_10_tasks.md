# Week 10 Tasks

1. Grab the new notebooks for this week. They are W10-1 through W10-6. (I'm
sure we won't get to all of them. But they're yours to keep.)
2. There's a new folder called "network_data".
You need that and all of the files inside. If you are working in Tactic, There
are three corresponding collections that you need to grab: "karategml", "lesmisgml",
and "bfbgml".
3. Work on your own corpus. Ask Bruce for help.
