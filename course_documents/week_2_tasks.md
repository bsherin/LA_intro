# Week 2 Tasks

0. Vien and Brian, you'll have to install the variable inspector if you want to use it.
(Brian I had trouble getting this to work at all on Windows.) First you
have to go into your `text_mining_2021` directory and activate your
virtual environment. Then run this command:

  ```
  pip install lckr-jupyterlab-variableinspector

  ```

  Then you have to restart jupyter lab. Find the terminal where jupyter lab is
  running. Hit control-c in that terminal. Then activate the virtual environment
  and execute `juptyer lab`.

  Tactic, of course, has its own version of the variable inspector built in.

1. Grab the new notebooks for this week. They are numbered W2-1 through W2-4.
    * If you're not using Tactic, grab the new notebooks for this week from this repository and put them in your `text_mining_2021` folder.
    * If you're using Tactic grab the new resources from the Tactic repository.
      * Go into tactic and click on "Repository" in the Navbar at the top of the page
      * Navigate to the `Projects` tab.
      * Highlight one notebook at a time and click this button:
      <img src="downbut.png" alt="drawing" width="25"/>. That will copy the resources
      to your personal library. After you've got all of the new notebooks you can
      close the browser tab with the repository.

2. Review the three notebooks that we went through in class. Take your time
understanding them.

3. Try the tasks in `W2-4 Solo work`.
