# Week 2 Tasks

0. Vien and Brian, you'll have to install the variable inspector if you want to use it.
(Brian I had trouble getting this to work at all on Windows.) First you
have to go into your `text_mining_2021` directory and activate your
virtual environment. Then run this command:

  ```
  pip install lckr-jupyterlab-variableinspector

  ```

  Then you have to restart jupyter lab. Find the terminal where jupyter lab is
  running. Hit control-c in that terminal. Then activate the virtual environment
  and execute `juptyer lab`.

  Tactic, of course, has its own version of the variable inspector built in.

1. Grab the new notebooks for this week from this repository and put them
in your `text_mining_2021` folder. They are numbered W2-1 through W2-4. (If your decide to work in Tactic you'll need to grab the new resources from the repository. I can tell you how to do that.)

2. Review the three notebooks that we went through in class. Take your time
understanding them.

3. Try the tasks in `W2-4 Solo work`.
