# Week 3 Tasks

1. Grab the new notebooks for this week. They are numbered W3-1 through W3-5.
  * (Follow the instructions from last week)
2. Grab the new data corpora for this week
  * If you're using Tactic, you can get them from the `Collections` tab of them repository.
  * If you're not using Tactic, get them from this repository and put them in your `corpora`
  folder.
3. Look at our analyses of the Titanic corpus in notebooks 3-1 and 3-2. Try to improve
on them.
  * This dataset has been the focus of a Kaggle challenge. If you poke around on the internet you might be able to find some suggestions. (I haven't poked around myself so I'm not sure.)
4. Try the analysis notebook 3-5.
5. See if you can improve on our analysis of the spam corpus in notebook 3-4.
6. The nltk book has a chapter on classifying text [here](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch06.html). I think it's worth taking a read through. You'll see that it uses as an example the "gender classification" of names.
