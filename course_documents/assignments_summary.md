# Assignments Summary

1. Weekly workbook-based analysis tasks
2. A few readings
3. One tool [report](tool_report_assignment.md)
    - One time during the quarter, you will pick a tool or library and you will give a brief, report for all of us on what the tool or library does. You can pick from the list [here](tools_and_libraries.md) or you can find one on your own. We will start these after we have completed the weeks on classification.
4. Assemble one corpus of your own and complete an analysis.
    - Set up a meeting with Bruce where you will decide on what data you'll work with and what the goal of your analysis will be.
    - The end product will be the analysis as a notebook. When we'll meet, we'll also set up
    intermediate checkpoints.
