One hundred and nine Earths would be required to fit across the Sun's disk, and its interior could hold over 1.3 million Earths. The Sun's outer visible layer is called the photosphere and has a temperature of 6,000  C (11,000 F). This layer has a mottled appearance due to the turbulent eruptions of energy at the surface.Solar energy is created deep within the core of the Sun. It is here that the temperature (15,000,000C ; 27,000,000 F) and pressure (340 billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level) is so intense that nuclear reactions take place. This reaction causes four protons or hydrogen nuclei to fuse together to form one alpha particle or helium nucleus. The alpha particle is about .7 percent less massive than the four protons. The difference in mass is expelled as energy and is carried to the surface of the Sun, through a process known as convection, where it is released as light and heat. Energy generated in the Sun's core takes a million years to reach its surface. Every second 700 million tons of hydrogen are converted into helium ashes. In the process 5 million tons of pure energy is released; therefore, as time goes on the Sun is becoming lighter.The chromosphere is above the photosphere. Solar energy passes through this region on its way out from the center of the Sun. Faculae and flares arise in the chromosphere. Faculae are bright luminous hydrogen clouds which form above regions where sunspots are about to form. Flares are bright filaments of hot gas emerging from sunspot regions. Sunspots are dark depressions on the photosphere with a typical temperature of 4,000 C (7,000 F).The corona is the outer part of the Sun's atmosphere. It is in this region that prominences appears. Prominences are immense clouds of glowing gas that erupt from the upper chromosphere. The outer region of the corona stretches far into space and consists of particles traveling slowly away from the Sun. The corona can only be seen during total solar eclipses. (See Solar Eclipse Image).The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or so. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium into heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing so large that it will swallow the Earth. After a billion years as a red giant, it will suddenly collapse into a white dwarf -- the final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion years to cool off completely.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.nineplanets.org/overview.html<TEXT>An Overview of the Solar SystemOrbitsThe solar system consists of the Sun; the nine planets, more than 130 satellites of the planets, a large number of small bodies (the comets and asteroids), and the interplanetary medium. (There are probably also many more planetary satellites that have not yet been discovered.)The inner solar system contains the Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars:inner solar systemThe main asteroid belt (not shown) lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The planets of the outer solar system are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto:outer solar systemThe first thing to notice is that the solar system is mostly empty space. The planets are very small compared to the space between them. Even the dots on the diagrams above are too big to be in proper scale with respect to the sizes of the orbits.The orbits of the planets are ellipses with the Sun at one focus, though all except Mercury and Pluto are very nearly circular. The orbits of the planets are all more or less in the same plane (called the ecliptic and defined by the plane of the Earth's orbit). The ecliptic is inclined only 7 degrees from the plane of the Sun's equator. Pluto's orbit deviates the most from the plane of the ecliptic with an inclination of 17 degrees. The above diagrams show the relative sizes of the orbits of the nine planets from a perspective somewhat above the ecliptic (hence their non-circular appearance). They all orbit in the same direction (counter-clockwise looking down from above the Sun's north pole); all but Venus, Uranus and Pluto also rotate in that same sense.(The above diagrams show correct positions for October 1996 as generated by the excellent planetarium program Starry Night; there are also many other similar programs available, some free.)SizesThe above composite shows the nine planets with approximately correct relative sizes (see another similar composite and a comparison of the terrestrial planets or Appendix 2 for more).One way to help visualize the relative sizes in the solar system is to imagine a model in which everything is reduced in size by a factor of a billion. Then the model Earth would be about 1.3 cm in diameter (the size of a grape). The Moon would be about 30 cm (about a foot) from the Earth. The Sun would be 1.5 meters in diameter (about the height of a man) and 150 meters (about a city block) from the Earth. Jupiter would be 15 cm in diameter (the size of a large grapefruit) and 5 blocks away from the Sun. Saturn (the size of an orange) would be 10 blocks away; Uranus and Neptune (lemons) 20 and 30 blocks away. A human on this scale would be the size of an atom but the nearest star would be over 40000 km away.Not shown in the above illustrations are the numerous smaller bodies that inhabit the solar system: the satellites of the planets; the large number of asteroids (small rocky bodies) orbiting the Sun, mostly between Mars and Jupiter but also elsewhere; the comets (small icy bodies) which come and go from the inner parts of the solar system in highly elongated orbits and at random orientations to the ecliptic; and the many small icy bodies beyond Neptune in the Kuiper Belt. With a few exceptions, the planetary satellites orbit in the same sense as the planets and approximately in the plane of the ecliptic but this is not generally true for comets and asteroids.ClassificationThe classification of these objects is a matter of minor controversy. Traditionally, the solar system has been divided into planets (the big bodies orbiting the Sun), their satellites (a.k.a. moons, variously sized objects orbiting the planets), asteroids (small dense objects orbiting the Sun) and comets (small icy objects with highly eccentric orbits). Unfortunately, the solar system has been found to be more complicated than this would suggest:    * there are several moons larger than Pluto and two larger than Mercury;    * there are many small moons that are probably started out as asteroids and were only later captured by a planet;    * comets sometimes fizzle out and become indistinguishable from asteroids;    * the Kuiper Belt objects and others like Chiron don't fit this scheme well and some even want to consider Pluto as part of this class;    * The Earth/Moon and Pluto/Charon systems are sometimes considered "double planets". Other classifications based on chemical composition and/or point of origin can be proposed which attempt to be more physically valid. But they usually end up with either too many classes or too many exceptions. The bottom line is that many of the bodies are unique; our present understanding is insufficient to establish clear categories. In the pages that follow, I will use the conventional categorizations.The nine bodies officially categorized as planets are often further classified in several ways:    * by composition:          o terrestrial or rocky planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars:                + The terrestrial planets are composed primarily of rock and metal and have relatively high densities, slow rotation, solid surfaces, no rings and few satellites.           o jovian or gas planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune:                + The gas planets are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium and generally have low densities, rapid rotation, deep atmospheres, rings and lots of satellites.           o Pluto.     * by size:          o small planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and Pluto.                + The small planets have diameters less than 13000 km.           o giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.                + The giant planets have diameters greater than 48000 km.           o Mercury and Pluto are sometimes referred to as lesser planets (not to be confused with minor planets which is the official term for asteroids).          o The giant planets are sometimes also referred to as gas giants.     * by position relative to the Sun:          o inner planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars.          o outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto.          o The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter forms the boundary between the inner solar system and the outer solar system.     * by position relative to Earth:          o inferior planets: Mercury and Venus.                + closer to the Sun than Earth.                + The inferior planets show phases like the Moon's when viewed from Earth.           o Earth.          o superior planets: Mars thru Pluto.                + farther from the Sun than Earth.                + The superior planets always appear full or nearly so.     * by history:          o classical planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.                + known since prehistorical times                + visible to the unaided eye           o modern planets: Uranus, Neptune, Pluto.                + discovered in modern times                + visible only with optical aid           o Earth. PicturesNote: most of the images in The Nine Planets are not true color. Most of them were created by combining several black and white images taken thru various color filters. Though the colors may look "right" chances are they aren't exactly what your eye would see.The Big Questions    * What is the origin of the solar system? It is generally agreed that it condensed from a nebula of dust and gas. But the details are far from clear.    * How common are planetary systems around other stars? There is now good evidence of Jupiter-sized objects orbiting several nearby stars. What conditions allow the formation of terrestrial planets? It seems unlikely that the Earth is totally unique but we still have no direct evidence one way or the other.    * Is there life elsewhere in the solar system? If not, why is Earth special?    * Is there life beyond the solar system? Intelligent life?    * Is life a rare and unusual or even unique event in the evolution of the universe or is it adaptable, widespread and common? </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://uz.ref.uz/download.php?id=14255 <TEXT>Our Sun is a normal main-sequence G2 star, one of more than 100 billion stars in our galaxy.        diameter:    1,390,000 km.        mass:        1.989e30 kg        temperature: 5800 K (surface)                     15,600,000 K (core)The Sun is by far the largest object in the solar system. It contains more than 99.8% of the total mass of the Solar System (Jupiter contains most of the rest).It is often said that the Sun is an "ordinary" star. That's true in the sense that there are many others similar to it. But there are many more smaller stars than larger ones; the Sun is in the top 10% by mass. The median size of stars in our galaxy is probably less than half the mass of the Sun.The Sun is personified in many mythologies: the Greeks called it Helios and the Romans called it Sol.The Sun is, at present, about 70% hydrogen and 28% helium by mass everything else ("metals") amounts to less than 2%. This changes slowly over time as the Sun converts hydrogen to helium in its core.The outer layers of the Sun exhibit differential rotation: at the equator the surface rotates once every 25.4 days; near the poles it's as much as 36 days. This odd behavior is due to the fact that the Sun is not a solid body like the Earth. Similar effects are seen in the gas planets. The differential rotation extends considerably down into the interior of the Sun but the core of the Sun rotates as a solid body.Conditions at the Sun's core (approximately the inner 25% of its radius) are extreme. The temperature is 15.6 million Kelvin and the pressure is 250 billion atmospheres. At the center of the core the Sun's density is more than 150 times that of water.The Sun's energy output (3.86e33 ergs/second or 386 billion billion megawatts) is produced by nuclear fusion reactions. Each second about 700,000,000 tons of hydrogen are converted to about 695,000,000 tons of helium and 5,000,000 tons (=3.86e33 ergs) of energy in the form of gamma rays. As it travels out toward the surface, the energy is continuously absorbed and re-emitted at lower and lower temperatures so that by the time it reaches the surface, it is primarily visible light. For the last 20% of the way to the surface the energy is carried more by convection than by radiation.The surface of the Sun, called the photosphere, is at a temperature of about 5800 K. Sunspots are "cool" regions, only 3800 K (they look dark only by comparison with the surrounding regions). Sunspots can be very large, as much as 50,000 km in diameter. Sunspots are caused by complicated and not very well understood interactions with the Sun's magnetic field.A small region known as the chromosphere lies above the photosphere.The highly rarefied region above the chromosphere, called the corona, extends millions of kilometers into space but is visible only during a total solar eclipse (left). Temperatures in the corona are over 1,000,000 K.It just happens that the Moon and the Sun appear the same size in the sky as viewed from the Earth. And since the Moon orbits the Earth in approximately the same plane as the Earth's orbit around the Sun sometimes the Moon comes directly between the Earth and the Sun. This is called a solar eclipse; if the alignment is slighly imperfect then the Moon covers only part of the Sun's disk and the event is called a partial eclipse. When it lines up perfectly the entire solar disk is blocked and it is called a total eclipse of the Sun. Partial eclipses are visible over a wide area of the Earth but the region from which a total eclipse is visible, called the path of totality, is very narrow, just a few kilometers (though it is usually thousands of kilometers long). Eclipses of the Sun happen once or twice a year. If you stay home, you're likely to see a partial eclipse several times per decade. But since the path of totality is so small it is very unlikely that it will cross you home. So people often travel half way around the world just to see a total solar eclipse. To stand in the shadow of the Moon is an awesome experience. For a few precious minutes it gets dark in the middle of the day. The stars come out. The animals and birds think it's time to sleep. And you can see the solar corona. It is well worth a major journey.The Sun's magnetic field is very strong (by terrestrial standards) and very complicated. Its magnetosphere (also known as the heliosphere) extends well beyond Pluto.In addition to heat and light, the Sun also emits a low density stream of charged particles (mostly electrons and protons) known as the solar wind which propagates throughout the solar system at about 450 km/sec. The solar wind and the much higher energy particles ejected by solar flares can have dramatic effects on the Earth ranging from power line surges to radio interference to the beautiful aurora borealis.Recent data from the spacecraft Ulysses show that during the minimum of the solar cycle the solar wind emanating from the polar regions flows at nearly double the rate, 750 kilometers per second, that it does at lower latitudes. The composition of the solar wind also appears to differ in the polar regions. During the solar maximum, however, the solar wind moves at an intermediate speed.Further study of the solar wind will be done by the recently launched Wind, ACE and SOHO spacecraft from the dynamically stable vantage point directly between the Earth and the Sun about 1.6 million km from Earth.The solar wind has large effects on the tails of comets and even has measurable effects on the trajectories of spacecraft.Spectacular loops and prominences are often visible on the Sun's limb (left).The Sun's output is not entirely constant. Nor is the amount of sunspot activity. There was a period of very low sunspot activity in the latter half of the 17th century called the Maunder Minimum. It coincides with an abnormally cold period in northern Europe sometimes known as the Little Ice Age. Since the formation of the solar system the Sun's output has increased by about 40%.The Sun is about 4.5 billion years old. Since its birth it has used up about half of the hydrogen in its core. It will continue to radiate "peacefully" for another 5 billion years or so (although its luminosity will approximately double in that time). But eventually it will run out of hydrogen fuel. It will then be forced into radical changes which, though commonplace by stellar standards, will result in the total destruction of the Earth (and probably the creation of a planetary nebula).</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://irsps.sci.unich.it/mirrors/nineplanets/earth.html <TEXT>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest:        orbit:    149,600,000 km (1.00 AU) from Sun        diameter: 12,756.3 km        mass:     5.972e24 kgPlanet EarthAmazing pictures of Earth from space combine useful science and artistic beauty.Orbit : Nasa Astronauts Photograph the EarthA beautiful coffee table book. Kids often ask me which is my favorite planet. My answer is always "Earth". This book shows why.Earth is the only planet whose English name does not derive from Greek/Roman mythology. The name derives from Old English and Germanic. There are, of course, hundreds of other names for the planet in other languages. In Roman Mythology, the goddess of the Earth was Tellus - the fertile soil (Greek: Gaia, terra mater - Mother Earth).It was not until the time of Copernicus (the sixteenth century) that it was understood that the Earth is just another planet.Mir and Earth's limbMir space station and Earth's limbEarth, of course, can be studied without the aid of spacecraft. Nevertheless it was not until the twentieth century that we had maps of the entire planet. Pictures of the planet taken from space are of considerable importance; for example, they are an enormous help in weather prediction and especially in tracking and predicting hurricanes. And they are extraordinarily beautiful.The Earth is divided into several layers which have distinct chemical and seismic properties (depths in km):     0-  40  Crust     40- 400  Upper mantle    400- 650  Transition region    650-2700  Lower mantle   2700-2890  D'' layer   2890-5150  Outer core   5150-6378  Inner core       The crust varies considerably in thickness, it is thinner under the oceans, thicker under the continents. The inner core and crust are solid; the outer core and mantle layers are plastic or semi-fluid. The various layers are separated by discontinuities which are evident in seismic data; the best known of these is the Mohorovicic discontinuity between the crust and upper mantle.Most of the mass of the Earth is in the mantle, most of the rest in the core; the part we inhabit is a tiny fraction of the whole (values below x10^24 kilograms):      atmosphere     = 0.0000051      oceans         = 0.0014      crust          = 0.026      mantle         = 4.043      outer core     = 1.835      inner core     = 0.09675The core is probably composed mostly of iron (or nickel/iron) though it is possible that some lighter elements may be present, too. Temperatures at the center of the core may be as high as 7500 K, hotter than the surface of the Sun. The lower mantle is probably mostly silicon, magnesium and oxygen with some iron, calcium and aluminum. The upper mantle is mostly olivene and pyroxene (iron/magnesium silicates), calcium and aluminum. We know most of this only from seismic techniques; samples from the upper mantle arrive at the surface as lava from volcanoes but the majority of the Earth is inaccessible. The crust is primarily quartz (silicon dioxide) and other silicates like feldspar. Taken as a whole, the Earth's chemical composition (by mass) is:Earth-South America South America by Galileo    34.6%  Iron    29.5%  Oxygen    15.2%  Silicon    12.7%  Magnesium     2.4%  Nickel     1.9%  Sulfur     0.05% TitaniumThe Earth is the densest major body in the solar system.The other terrestrial planets probably have similar structures and compositions with some differences: the Moon has at most a small core; Mercury has an extra large core (relative to its diameter); the mantles of Mars and the Moon are much thicker; the Moon and Mercury may not have chemically distinct crusts; Earth may be the only one with distinct inner and outer cores. Note, however, that our knowledge of planetary interiors is mostly theoretical even for the Earth.Unlike the other terrestrial planets, Earth's crust is divided into several separate solid plates which float around independently on top of the hot mantle below. The theory that describes this is known as plate tectonics. It is characterized by two major processes: spreading and subduction. Spreading occurs when two plates move away from each other and new crust is created by upwelling magma from below. Subduction occurs when two plates collide and the edge of one dives beneath the other and ends up being destroyed in the mantle. There is also transverse motion at some plate boundaries (i.e. the San Andreas Fault in California) and collisions between continental plates (i.e. India/Eurasia). There are (at present) eight major plates:    * North American Plate - North America, western North Atlantic and Greenland      Plate boundaries Earth's Plate Boundaries delineated by earthquake epicenters    * South American Plate - South America and western South Atlantic    * Antarctic Plate - Antarctica and the "Southern Ocean"    * Eurasian Plate - eastern North Atlantic, Europe and Asia except for India    * African Plate - Africa, eastern South Atlantic and western Indian Ocean    * Indian-Australian Plate - India, Australia, New Zealand and most of Indian Ocean    * Nazca Plate - eastern Pacific Ocean adjacent to South America    * Pacific Plate - most of the Pacific Ocean (and the southern coast of California!) There are also twenty or more small plates such as the Arabian, Cocos, and Philippine Plates. Earthquakes are much more common at the plate boundaries. Plotting their locations makes it easy to see the plate boundaries.The Earth's surface is very young. In the relatively short (by astronomical standards) period of 500,000,000 years or so erosion and tectonic processes destroy and recreate most of the Earth's surface and thereby eliminate almost all traces of earlier geologic surface history (such as impact craters). Thus the very early history of the Earth has mostly been erased. The Earth is 4.5 to 4.6 billion years old, but the oldest known rocks are about 4 billion years old and rocks older than 3 billion years are rare. The oldest fossils of living organisms are less than 3.9 billion years old. There is no record of the critical period when life was first getting started.Strait of Gibraltar Space Shuttle view of the Strait of Gibraltar71 Percent of the Earth's surface is covered with water. Earth is the only planet on which water can exist in liquid form on the surface (though there may be liquid ethane or methane on Titan's surface and liquid water beneath the surface of Europa). Liquid water is, of course, essential for life as we know it. The heat capacity of the oceans is also very important in keeping the Earth's temperature relatively stable. Liquid water is also responsible for most of the erosion and weathering of the Earth's continents, a process unique in the solar system today (though it may have occurred on Mars in the past).Earth's atmosphere Earth's atmosphere seen at the limbThe Earth's atmosphere is 77% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, with traces of argon, carbon dioxide and water. There was probably a very much larger amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere when the Earth was first formed, but it has since been almost all incorporated into carbonate rocks and to a lesser extent dissolved into the oceans and consumed by living plants. Plate tectonics and biological processes now maintain a continual flow of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to these various "sinks" and back again. The tiny amount of carbon dioxide resident in the atmosphere at any time is extremely important to the maintenance of the Earth's surface temperature via the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect raises the average surface temperature about 35 degrees C above what it would otherwise be (from a frigid -21 C to a comfortable +14 C); without it the oceans would freeze and life as we know it would be impossible.Earth from Apollo 11 View from Apollo 11The presence of free oxygen is quite remarkable from a chemical point of view. Oxygen is a very reactive gas and under "normal" circumstances would quickly combine with other elements. The oxygen in Earth's atmosphere is produced and maintained by biological processes. Without life there would be no free oxygen.The interaction of the Earth and the Moon slows the Earth's rotation by about 2 milliseconds per century. Current research indicates that about 900 million years ago there were 481 18-hour days in a year.Earth has a modest magnetic field produced by electric currents in the outer core. The interaction of the solar wind, the Earth's magnetic field and the Earth's upper atmosphere causes the auroras (see the Interplanetary Medium). Irregularities in these factors cause the magnetic poles to move and even reverse relative to the surface; the geomagnetic north pole is currently located in northern Canada. (The "geomagnetic north pole" is the position on the Earth's surface directly above the south pole of the Earth's field; see this diagram.)The Earth's magnetic field and its interaction with the solar wind also produce the Van Allen radiation belts, a pair of doughnut shaped rings of ionized gas (or plasma) trapped in orbit around the Earth. The outer belt stretches from 19,000 km in altitude to 41,000 km; the inner belt lies between 13,000 km and 7,600 km in altitude.Earth's SatelliteEarth has only one natural satellite, the Moon. But    * thousands of small artificial satellites have also been placed in orbit around the Earth.    * Asteroids 3753 Cruithne and 2002 AA29 have complicated orbital relationships with the Earth; they're not really moons, the term "companion" is being used. It is somewhat similar to the situation with Saturn's moons Janus and Epimetheus.    * Lilith doesn't exist but it's an interesting story.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.nineplanets.org/other.html<TEXT>Are there planets orbiting other stars beyond our solar system? We do not know for sure, but with the recent discoveries about 51 Pegasi, 70 Virginis and 47 Ursae Majoris the weight of evidence is now so strong that only a "devil's advocate" denies the conclusions. Here is some of what we do know (this is somewhat incomplete; please see the references below for more info):Facts    * Three small bodies have been found in orbit around the pulsar PSR 1257+12. They have been designated "PSR1257+12 A, ..B, and ..C". One is about the size of the Moon, the other two are about 2 to 3 times the mass of Earth.      They were discovered by measuring variations in the pulsation speed of the pulsar which can be interpreted as gravitational effects of three small planets. The original observation has been confirmed but, of course, no direct images have been made -- that is way beyond the capabilities of our best telescopes.      These planets are believed to have formed after the supernova that produced the pulsar. The present planets would have originally been within the envelope of the progenitor star and therefore wouldn't have stood much chance of surviving the supernova explosion, and wouldn't have remained in circular orbits after the explosion.      Several decades of timing data on the pulsar PSR 0329+54 (PKS B0329+54) by Tatiana Shabanova (Lebedev Physics Institute) shows evidence of a planet with a 16.9 year period and mass greater than 2 Earth masses.      But, while the evidence for these is pretty good, they aren't really what we're looking for when we talk about 'solar systems'.    * It has been known since 1983 that the star Beta Pictoris is surrounded by a disk of gas and dust. Spectra of Beta Pictoris show absorption features which are currently believed to be due to cometary like clouds of gas occultating the star from the debris left over from planetary formation. Though it's far from certain it is believed by some that planets may already have formed around Beta Pictoris.      HST has observed Beta Pictoris (right) and found the disk to be significantly thinner than previously thought. Estimates based on the Hubble image place the disk's thickness as no more than one billion miles (1600 million kilometers), or about 1/4 previous estimates from ground-based observations. The disk is tilted nearly edge-on to Earth. Because the dust has had enough time to settle into a flat plane, the disk may be older than some previous estimates. A thin disk also increases the probability that comet-sized or larger bodies have formed through accretion in the disk. Both conditions are believed to be characteristic of a hypothesized circumstellar disk around our own Sun, which was a necessary precursor to the planet-building phase of our Solar Systems, according to current theory.      More recent HST observations have shown the disk to be slightly warped as might be expected from the gravitational influence of a planet. This has been confirmed by observations at ESO.    * Recent observations at radio wavelengths of a gas cloud known as Bok Globule B335 have produced images of material collapsing onto a newly born star (only about 150,000 years old). These observations are helping to understand how stars and planets form. The phenomena observed matches the theory of the formation of the solar system -- that is, a large gas cloud collapsed to form a star with an attendant circumstellar disk in which, over time, planets accreted from the matter in the disk and orbited the Sun.    * The IRAS satellite found that Vega had too much infrared emission, and that has been attributed to a dust shell (with a mass of maybe Earth's moon).    * Observations of the very nearby Barnard's Star were once thought to be evidence of gravitational effects of planets but they now seem to have been in error.    * The star Gl229 seems to contain a 20 Jupiter mass object orbiting at a distance of 44 AU. An object this large is probably a brown-dwarf rather than an ordinary planet.    * What may be the first discovery of a planet orbiting a normal, Sun-like star other than our own has been announced by astronomers studying 51 Pegasi, a spectral type G2-3 V main-sequence star 42 light-years from Earth. At a recent conference in Florence, Italy, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of Geneva Observatory explained that they observed 51 Pegasi with a high-resolution spectrograph and found that the star's line-of-sight velocity changes by some 70 meters per second every 4.2 days. If this is due to orbital motion, these numbers suggest that a planet lies only 7 million kilometers from 51 Pegasi -- much closer than Mercury is to the Sun -- and that the planet has a mass at least half that of Jupiter. These physical characteristics hinge on the assumption that our line of sight is near the planet's orbital plane. However, other evidence suggests that this is a good bet. A world merely 7 million km from a star like 51 Pegasi should have a temperature of about 1,000 degrees Celsius, just short of red hot. It was initially thought that it might be a solid body like a very big Mercury but the concensus now seems to be that it is a "hot Jupiter", a gas planet formed much farther from its star that migrated inward.      These observations have now been confirmed by several independent observers. And there is some evidence for a second planet much farther out that is not yet confirmed.      The 5.5-magnitude 51 Pegasi is easily visible in binoculars between Alpha and Beta Pegasi, the western pair of stars in the Great Square of Pegasus. The star's equinox-2000 coordinates are R.A. 22 hours 57 minutes, Dec. +20 degrees 46 minutes.    * On 1/17/96 Geoffrey Marcy and Paul Butler announced the discovery of planets orbiting the stars 70 Virginis and 47 Ursae Majoris. 70 Vir is a G5V (main sequence) star about 78 light-years from Earth; 47 UMa is a G0V star about 44 light-years away. These were discovered using the same Doppler shift technique that found the planet orbiting 51 Pegasi.      The planet around 70 Vir orbits the star in an eccentric, elongated orbit every 116 days and has a mass about nine times that of Jupiter. Using standard formulas that balance the sunlight absorbed and the heat radiated, Marcy and Butler calculated the temperature of the planet at about 85 degrees Celsius (185 degrees Fahrenheit), cool enough to permit water and complex organic molecules to exist. The star 70 Vir is nearly identical to the Sun, though several hundred degrees cooler and perhaps three billion years older.      The planet around 47 UMa was discovered after analysis of eight years of observations at Lick Observatory. Its period is a little over three years (1100 days), its mass about three times that of Jupiter, and its orbital radius about twice the Earth's distance from the Sun. This planet too probably has a region in its atmosphere where the temperature would allow liquid water.    * As of April 1996, Drs. Marcy and Butler have discovered yet another planet this time around the star HR3522 (aka Rho 1 Cancri, 55 Cancri) about 45 light years from the Earth. The planet is estimated to be about 0.8 Jupiter masses. It is likely that several more planets will show up in the initial set of 120 stars that they have monitored.    * Several more extra-solar planets have now been discovered by the Butler/Marcy method. It seems likely that there are a very large number of such planets out there.    * Another extra-solar planet has been discovered orbiting 16 Cygni B. But unlike all other previously known planets this one has a very large orbital eccentricity (0.6); its orbit carries it from a closest distance of 0.6 AU from its star to 2.7 AU. This calls into question many theories of planetary formation.    * Detecting extra-solar planets directly is very difficult. Even the Hubble Space Telescope wouldn't be able to image planets at the expected sizes and distances from their suns.      What HST did find were disks of matter around stars seen in silhouette against the Orion Nebula (called 'proplyds', for 'proto-planetary disks' (right). This is great evidence for how common these objects are, but the scale is way too small to say anything directly about planets there. More detailed HST images are now available, too.    * Nevertheless, it might be possible to detect the infra-red radiation of very large planets (Jupiter-sized or more) in some circumstances.    * By a stroke of good luck, HST has taken an image of what appears to be a planet escaping from a double star system. See the 1998 May 28 announcement. If this is confirmed, the existence of extrasolar planets will be undeniable. </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_thurman_introocean_9/5/1359/348027.cw/index.html <TEXT>IntroductionMany would argue that a major contributor to marine environmental problems is human population growth and excess consumption of resources. (Not all harmful impacts on the marine environment are due to population growth, of course: the near-extinction of many whale species in the 19th century occurred when the population was less than one-fifth of today's total.) In this web analysis, we present you with some basic mathematical tools necessary to interpret human population growth, using as an example Bangladesh.Dr. Selina Begum of the U.K.'s Bradford University, writes :    "A one-meter (3.3 ft) rise in sea level could turn a moderate storm into a catastrophic one. The tropical cyclones of the Bay of Bengal form only when sea surface temperatures reach 27 degrees C or higher. Tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal generally form in the pre-monsoon (April-June), and post-monsoon (October-December) seasons. An increase in the surface air temperature (due to global warming) might lead to a more widespread occurrence of cyclones in the Bay of Bengal." Clearly Bangladesh faces the potential for catastrophe from the combination of coastal population growth, coastal subsidence, land-use changes in the catchment area, and global climate change. As you know, global climate change is thought to be strongly influenced by the release of vast quantities of greenhouse gases, mainly from the burning of fossil fuels in industrial countries and China. Bangladesh's 1992 emissions of CO2, the principal greenhouse gas, totaled 17.2 million metric tons (37.8 x 109 lb), compared to the United States' 4.9 billion metric tons (10.8 x 1012 lb), which was by far the world's major source, more than double that of the former Soviet Union. The per capita emissions were even more disparate: 0.15 metric tons (330 lb) per Bangladeshi compared to 19.13 metric tons (42,086 lb) for each resident of the United States.Chances are, you live within 100 km (62 mi) of the beach. According to the World Resources Institute, at least 60% of the planet's human population live that close to the coastline. Coastal areas have the fastest growing populations as well. Not surprisingly, over half the world's coastlines are at significant risk from development-related activities. Some of these activities are:    * Conversion of tropical mangrove communities to fish and shrimp farms    * Expansion of many coastal cities which are in the direct path of hurricanes, monsoons, and tropical storms    * Pollution from Western-style industrial agriculture, including industrial meat production    * Releases of untreated or partially treated human sewage (between one-third and two-thirds of the human waste generated in developing countries is not even collected). Sewage and Animal Waste ImpactsSewage and animal waste may contain a number of harmful substances, including pathogens such as bacteria and viruses.In addition to pathogens, untreated or partially treated sewage contains high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, which are essential nutrients for growth of plants and algae. Excess nitrogen and phosphorus can stimulate rapid growth of algae, which can form a thick layer at the water surface. This surface layer of algae may thrive in the short term, but it can block sunlight from lower layers, whose plants eventually die. Moreover, rapidly-growing algae can quickly deplete nutrients, resulting in rapid die-offs. In both cases, oxygen-using bacteria begin to decompose the dead algae. This can cause hypoxia (dangerously low oxygen levels) or anoxia (absence of oxygen).Sewage can also contain heavy metals such as copper and zinc, which are toxic to plants and algae (these metals are often fed to pigs as supplements in amounts that exceed the animals' ability to metabolize them, so they end up in the animals' waste).Coastal cities are reaching sizes unprecedented in human history. Here are but a few examples: Sao Paolo, Brazil, 17 million; Bombay, India, 16.5 million; Lagos, Nigeria, 11 million (and growing at a rate of 5.7% per year); Dhaka, Bangladesh, 8 million (growth rate nearly 6% per year). Most of these cities make little attempt to treat the sewage produced by their residents. On our web site, we evaluate the impact of the growth of some of these cities.Case Study: BangladeshBangladesh (Figure 1), a country about the size of Illinois, Wisconsin, or Florida, lies on the northern shore of the Indian Ocean. Dr. Selina Begum of the U.K.'s Bradford University wrote1:    Bangladesh is a delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna Rivers. Tributaries and distributaries [branches] of the river system cover all of the country. The rivers rise in the Himalayas and drain a catchment area of about 1.5 million km2 [577,000 mi2],          only 7.5 percent of which lies in Bangladesh    [Our emphasis. Stop and explain why the responsibility for Bangladesh's destiny may lie with others far away.].    The country is prone to meteorological and geologic natural disasters, due to its geographic location, climate, variable topography, dynamic river system and exposure to the sea. The steady increase in population continuously increases the potential for natural disaster. Bangladesh thus makes an ideal case illustrating the impacts of coastal growth.Map of Bangladesh Showing Generalized Tracks of Twentieth Century Cyclones.BackgroundBangladesh was originally part of Pakistan after the Indian subcontinent gained independence from Britain in 1947. In 1970, Bangladesh seceded from the rest of Pakistan. It had a 1999 population of 127 million on a land area of 144,000 km2 (55,000 mi2).Bangladesh is vulnerable to catastrophic flooding from river discharges as well as from tropical storms. In addition, it is defenseless against sea level rise from global climate change since more than half the country lies at an elevation of less than 8 meters (26 ft) above sea level. Moreover, 17 million people live on land that is less than 1 m (3.3 ft) above sea level. As a result, about 25-30% of the country is flooded each year, which can increase to 60-80% during major floodsFlooding in Bangladesh can result from some combination of the following: (1) excess rainfall and snowmelt in the catchment basin, especially in the foothills of the Himalayas (an area where many of the Earth's rainfall records were set); (2) simultaneous peak flooding in all three main rivers; and (3) high tides in the Bay of Bengal, which can dam runoff from rivers and cause the water to "pond up" and overtop its banks.In addition, changes in land use in the far reaches of the catchment area can result in profound changes in the flood potential of Bangladesh's rivers. For example, deforestation of the Himalayan foothills for agriculture, fuelwood, or human habitation can make the hills more prone to flash flooding. Then, during the torrential monsoon rains, mudslides can dump huge volumes of sediment into the rivers. This sediment can literally pile up in the river channels, reducing channel depth and thereby the channel's capacity to transport water. Result: more water sloshing over the rivers' banks during floods, and more disastrous floods in Bangladesh. Another result: the silt can smother offshore reefs when it finally reaches the ocean. Geologists estimate that the drainage system dumps at least 635 million metric tons (1.4 x 1012 lb ) of sediment a year into the Indian Ocean, which is four times the amount of the present Mississippi River.Some researchers feel that Western-style development is contributing to Bangladesh's increased vulnerability to natural disasters. Farhad Mazhar, director of the Bangladeshi research and development group Ubinin, concludes that the basic problem is Western-style development. He observes that to be modern the Bangladeshis built roads, which blocked floodwaters. These and other modern improvements increased flooding from cyclones and have also increased the damage and loss of life. Mazhar concludes,. . . if you compare the history of the old cyclones and flood waters, you'll see . . . the misery has increased with this kind of 'engineering' solution to water2.Truly catastrophic floods can result when high tides coincide with tropical storms. In the early 1990's, such a combination took over 125,000 lives. About one tenth of all Earth's tropical cyclones occur in the Bay of Bengal (Figure 1), and about 40% of the global deaths from storm surges occur in Bangladesh.Storm surges result when cyclones with winds that can exceed 250 km/hour (155 mi/hr), move onshore, and push a massive wall of seawater onshore with them. Surges in excess of 5 meters (16.4 ft) above high tide are not uncommon, so you can imagine the impact such a storm can have on a country in which half the land is within 8 meters (26.2 ft) of sea level!Computer models forecast an average rise of sea level of 66 cm (26 in) by 2100 due to global warming, but sea level could rise anywhere from 20-140 cm (8-55 in). There is, however, a complicating factor: The deltas on which Bangladesh is built are subsiding, meaning the area will be more susceptible to the flooding that will accompany sea level rise.Subsidence is a natural feature of deltas. The water in a large river may reach the sea in one or more branches, or distributaries. As the distributaries evolve, they may meander more and more, thus lengthening the river's route to the sea. During floods, the distributary can overtop its banks and cut a new and shorter route to the sea. This can result in a rapid shift in where sedimentation occurs at the delta's mouth. An existing delta can sometimes be quickly abandoned, and without the constant addition of new sediment, it subsides.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_abel_issuesocean_2/3/891/228230.cw/index.html <TEXT>Issue 8 - Lifestyles of the Large and...Issue Discussion    * What enables the blue whale to grow so large?    * Why is the Antarctic marine ecosystem so productive?    * What are krill, and why are they considered a 'keystone species'?    * What are the threats to the Antarctic marine ecosystem? IntroductionWhat is the largest living organism on Earth?If you answered blue whale, you'd be wrong. The designation actually belongs either to the redwood tree Sequoia sempervirens or to the soil fungus Armillaria bulbosa, which lives in northern Michigan.But the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus;) is the largest animal that ever lived, reaching a length of about 30 m (98 ft) and weighing around 100 tons (91,000 kg).Have you ever wondered why this is the only living animal that grows to this size? Exactly what permits this species to achieve its dimensions but prohibits others from doing so?An Introduction to Antarctic Marine EcologyThe blue whale spends its summers in the waters surrounding Antarctica, the planet's fifth largest continent. Antarctica is completely surrounded by the southernmost extensions of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, a physically distinct body of water collectively referred to as the Southern Ocean. The closest continent, South America is 970 km (600 mi) away.Antarctica is, of course, a land mass, but you wouldn't know it from looking at it: nearly 98% of its 14 million km2 (5.4 million mi2 ) is covered with ice up to 4.5 km (nearly 3 mi) thick. Including sea ice, Antarctica holds 90% of the world's ice and 70% of the world's fresh water. Ironically, despite this much fresh water, because there is no rain in the interior (less than 4 cm of fine crystals known as 'diamond dust' per year), the continent is essentially a barren desert.The Southern OceanIn contrast to the Antarctic land mass, the Southern Ocean supports a richly productive assemblage of organisms.What makes these cold waters so productive is the southerly flow of deep, nutrient-rich water known as Circumpolar Deep Water. This water rises to the surface (upwells) near the continent from depths of 3000 m (9800 ft) and makes nutrients available to photosynthetic organisms (principally diatoms), which must live in the sunlit surface waters. It also transfers heat to the Antarctic atmosphere. In addition, during the Antarctic summer there is six months of daylight. Thus, photosynthesis can occur 24 hours a day during the summer.The northern limit of this productivity is a narrow belt of water from 20 to 30 miles (32-48 km) wide known as the Antarctic Convergence, or Polar Front. Here, cold Antarctic surface waters sink below warmer waters flowing south. This is also the northern boundary of the Southern Ocean.KrillThe key indicator of this Antarctic productivity, in terms of biomass, is not the diatoms or other tiny photosynthetic organisms that actually use the nutrients in the first place. It is a 5 to 6 cm (2-2.5 in) long crustacean called Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba, Figure 2) which can top the scales at 2 g (0.1 ou). Krill, meaning young fish in Norwegian, is a term applied to a group of about 85 species of shrimplike organisms collectively called euphausiids (Phylum Arthropoda) that inhabit waters from the poles to the tropics. Krill are filter-feeding organisms which use their setae-covered appendages to trap the tiny diatoms. They are heavier than water and must swim continuously to avoid sinking. While the life span of krill is not known with certainty, scientific estimates range from 5-11 years. Krill are eaten by whales, seals, birds, squid, and fish, and to a lesser but growing extent by humans.It is quite possible that krill are the most abundant animal species on earth. Dense aggregates weighing an estimated 2 million tons (1.8 billion kg) and covering as much as 450 km2 (170 mi2) have been observed. Density of krill schools reportedly reach 30,000 animals per cubic meter of seawater! The total standing stock (the biomass at any time) has been estimated to be between 200 and 700 million tons (200-700 billion kg). In contrast, the 1997 total world fish catch was less than 100 million tons (100 billion kg).Thus, the numerical abundance and biomass of krill, as well as its important position in the food web (see Figure 3), make it a keystone species in its ecosystem. A keystone species is one whose impact on its ecosystem is disproportionately large and whose loss would severely disrupt the system.Simplified Antarctic marine food web.Krill FisheriesBefore the advent of European whaling in the 19th century, baleen whales consumed huge volumes of krill. After the near-extinction of these whales by the 1960's, some viewed krill to be present in surplus amounts (estimated at 150 million tons!) which could be harvested without impacting either the species of the marine environment.Large-scale fisheries for krill (Antarctic and North Pacific krill) currently occur only in Antarctic waters and off the coast of Japan. In the mid-70s, the Soviets were the first to operate full-scale fisheries for Antarctic krill. Japan, Poland, Ukraine, and Poland currently conduct Antarctic krill fisheries.As conventional world fisheries decline from overfishing, there will be greater emphasis on increasing commercial catches of species from more distant waters. This increase in demand will lead to a greater pressure on Antarctic krill, which are the largest known krill stock.Currently, most krill taken are used as bait and aquaculture feed, although a significant proportion is used for human consumption. Krill are fed to farmed fish because of their nutritional value and also because krill contain high concentrations of the red pigment group carotenoids, which heightens the red color of fish. Japanese consumers consider red as a sign of good luck and as an appetite stimulant.The Antarctic krill fishery is not increasing currently due to the immense expense of conducting a fishery in Antarctic waters. However, it is likely that in the future this will change because of the growing pressure to catch krill commercially for use as feed in aquaculture. Krill fisheries may also respond to demand for krill concentrate, a health food because of its omega-3 fatty acids content. What this portends for krill is not known because fishery managers have little experience in dealing with an organism such as the krill, which occupies a low but vital position on the food web. Thus, while krill fisheries may increase the world's ocean harvest, they also could cause harm, perhaps catastrophic harm, to this species and to marine ecosystems.Threats to the Antarctic Marine Environment  Even though it is far removed from the kinds of environmental problems most of the world is facing (fisheries notwithstanding), the Southern Ocean ecosystem is facing some major threats. Temperature increases due to global warming will likely result in accelerated melting of ice sheets and the addition of massive volumes of freshwater to the marine environment.1 Written with Steve Berkowitz of the Department of Marine Science of Coastal Carolina UniversityThreats to the Antarctic Marine EnvironmentEven though it is far removed from the kinds of environmental problems most of the world is facing (fisheries notwithstanding), the Southern Ocean ecosystem is facing some major threats. Temperature increases due to global warming will likely result in accelerated melting of ice sheets and the addition of massive volumes of freshwater to the marine environment. This could disrupt the sinking of cold, dense water masses (known as thermohaline circulation), which is a major source of the world's bottom water. The effects of disrupting the flow of bottom water cannot be predicted, but they would certainly be severe. Also, Antarctic marine organisms would be particularly susceptible to temperature increases because they live (and have evolved in) a relatively stable thermal environment. In addition, like all organisms, Antarctic organisms live closer to their thermal maximum (the highest temperature they can tolerate) than their thermal minimum. Thus, increases in temperature could lead to a host of lethal and sublethal effects.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_abel_issuesocean_2/3/891/228216.cw/index.html <TEXT>Issue 6 - Beaches or Bedrooms? The...Issue Discussion    * What factors affect beach location and shape?    * How has coastal development influenced the beach environment?    * What are the pros and cons of beachfront stabilization? BackgroundBeaches are dynamic zones that change in shape over both space and time. Beaches may stretch for thousands of km along passive margin shorelines (i.e., those without seismic activity such as the U.S. Atlantic coast), but extensive beaches are rare in tectonically active uplift areas along active margin shorelines, for example, the Pacific coast of North and South America.The shape of a beach may vary over distances of a kilometer to hundreds of kilometers and is based on the balance between processes that promote erosion and processes that favor deposition of sediment. These in turn are influenced by local physical and geologic characteristics.Over time, the shape of beaches is influenced by short-term storm events (days); normal seasonal changes in wave intensity (month to year); longer-term (years to decades) climatic phenomena like El Nino and La Nina and periods of high hurricane activity; and very long-term (century to millennium) changes in global sea level.In the last 18,000 years, sea level has risen about 120 meters (400 ft) and many coastal shorelines have moved dramatically inland. Off the East Coast of the United States geologists estimate that the shoreline has migrated inland more than 80 km (50 mi) during this period, alternating between active migration and static periods. Based upon a rough average of typical beach slopes, for each unit rise in sea level, the beach will migrate 1000 to 2,000 units inland.All 30 states bordering an ocean or the Great Lakes have erosion problems, and 26 are presently experiencing net loss of their shores. As an example of this erosion and shoreline migration process, consider the Cape Hatteras lighthouse in North Carolina and its location relative to the shoreline. In 1870, the lighthouse was situated about 450 m (1475 ft) feet from the ocean. By 1919, the ocean had advanced to within 100 m (325 feet) of the tower, and by 1935, it was within 30 m (100 ft). After a series of strategies designed to hold back the coastal erosion failed (not a surprise to coastal geologists), the lighthouse was finally moved nearly 900 m (2950 ft) inshore in 1999. Attempts to save the neighboring Morris Island lighthouse in South Carolina are currently in progress.Erosion is a natural and sometimes predictable process. Still, despite this knowledge, the movement of shorelines inland has been a serious problem to coastal residents and businesses, especially in the middle and southern Atlantic and Gulf regions of the United States. This issue is further examined on our Web site.Composition and Structure of BeachesMany factors affect the shape, composition, and structure of beaches. The shape varies with sand supply, sea level change, and wave size. When any of these factors change, the other factors respond accordingly. For example, if the supply of sand is reduced and sea level and wave size remain constant, the beach profile will change because the diminished sand supply creates an erosional environment, leading to the landward movement of the beach's intertidal region. Decreasing wave energy, holding the other physical factors constant, will cause either reduced erosion or natural accretion (building) of the beach.The slow but unrelenting assault of sea level rise upon coastlines is difficult to recognize on a daily basis, but storm or hurricane-induced erosion, property damage, and loss of life capture our immediate attention. Fortunately, increased capabilities in weather forecasting have resulted in a decrease in the loss of life from storms over the last century in the United States. However, increasing population growth and development in coastal regions has led to an increase in property damage from extreme weather events over this same time period Figure 1The graphs above from the NOAA National Weather Service illustrate the great increase in property damage but reduction in the loss of life associated with U.S. hurricanes since 1900.  (NOAA)It has been predicted that global sea level will rise by approximately 1 meter in the next century, meaning that along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts, the shoreline will migrate approximately 2000 meters (6560 ft) inland. Compound this phenomenon with the anticipated increased hurricane activity in the Atlantic, and the long-term prognosis for coastal development begins to look precarious.To further complicate matters, human attempts to slow beach erosion often exacerbate the problem. Construction of seawalls, jetties, revetments, and groins may stabilize local portions of the beach but can cause problems in adjoining areas. Seawalls, which parallel the shoreline, may temporarily protect property but eventually lead to the loss of the beach, a process called "Newjerseyization, named for the state where seawall construction has been a common practice in postponing property loss.Beach RenourishmentAlthough many states no longer permit construction of hardened structures such as sea walls and groins, the alternative practice of beach renourishment has become increasingly common in the last several decades. Beach renourishment involves bringing in sand, by dredge, barge, or truck, to build up the height and breadth of disappearing beaches. The sand may come from inland sources, or from subtidal shelf regions. This practice is expensive and temporary, but it provides a key benefit compared to constructing hard structures in that it allows the beach to continue to exist. This benefit of beach renourishment, combined with a significant federal subsidy, is an especially appealing alternative in areas which depend on tourism.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for designing and implementing renourishment operations. Much controversy exists regarding the efficacy and accuracy of the Corps' renourishment practices. One of the most common problems is that the Corps' estimated renourishment interval tends to be considerably longer than the actual interval before the next required renourishment; that is, the Corps overestimates how long a beach will last after renourishment. As of 1987, 400 million cubic yards (365 x 106 m3) of sand have been used to renourish beaches in the United States. By 1995, the total cumulative national cost of continued renourishment approached $5 billion.Renourishment practices have led to a false sense of security for many beachfront residents, and the continued subsidy of renourishment by the federal government has had the effect of stimulating additional beachfront development. Technically, we may be able to continue in the near future to repair the localized storm impact erosion to prime tourism locales (win the battle), but the reality of global sea level rise means that in the future we will eventually have to abandon current beachfront property (lose the war), or install an extremely expensive series of dikes, as they have done in Holland, to protect our shoreline. The Dutch have spent around $15 billion during the 90's, which is around $1,000 for each citizen, suggesting that we might have to spend $270 billion to protect our coasts!Beach renourishment may have both direct and indirect effects upon flora and fauna of the sandy shore. The direct effects of beach renourishment include impacts that occur during dredging of subtidal materials, as well as those that occur during emplacement. Many coastal dredging operations which obtain sand material for beach renourishment impact species in the process. Certain types of dredges can cause high mortalities of female sea turtles during the nesting season. Many of the subtidal invertebrate organisms collected in the dredge material die after emplacement into the intertidal environment.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/11/2880/737342.cw/index.html<TEXT>During the afternoon and evening of May 3, 1999, dozens of emergency advisories like these two were issued to residents of the south central United States as one of the worst tornado outbreaks in decades punished the area. Worst hit was central Oklahoma, where at least 57 tornadoes killed 44 people and injured 748 others (Figure 1-1). In Kansas another five people were killed and 11,000 homes or businesses were damaged or destroyed. Over the next few days, the same storm that spawned the tornadoes slowly worked its way to neighboring states, killing five more people in Texas and Tennessee.The storm system contained eleven major storm elements, called supercells, that followed a southwest-to-northeast path. Each supercell produced at least one tornado, with the most destructive supercell yielding 22 in a 3-hour period while covering a distance of 61 kilometers (km), or 38 miles (mi). The largest of its tornadoes was about 2 km (1 mi) wide and stayed on the ground for nearly an hour and a half.As terrible as the outbreak was, things would have been very much worse had it not been for the extensive forecasting, tracking, and warning capabilities of the National Weather Service. One study based on long-term observations suggests that as many as 700 people might have perished had it not been for the recent modernization of the Weather Service. People such as Air Force Captain John Millhouse would readily agree with that notion. Having heard one of the tornado warnings, he and his family moved to the basement of their home. When they emerged unscathed, only two walls of the house were left standing; the rest was totally destroyed.Not all weather phenomena are as dramatic as tornadoes, but it is indisputable that the weather exerts a tremendous impact on our day-to-day lives: we revel in the beauty of a sunrise, marvel at the power of hurricanes, rely on the rain to nourish our gardens, and complain about the heat-and the cold. Despite its immediacy, most of us know relatively little about how and why the atmosphere behaves as it does. In the pages that follow, we hope to provide an account of both the how and the why, in ways that will lead you to an understanding of the underlying physical processes. As you will see, the atmosphere is a mixture of gas molecules, microscopically small suspended particles of solid and liquid, and falling precipitation. Meteorology is the study of the atmosphere and the processes (such as cloud formation, lightning, and wind movement) that cause what we refer to as the "weather." This chapter introduces the most basic elements of meteorology, laying the foundation for much of what follows in the rest of the book.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/0,7836,737386-,00.html<TEXT>Looking north at Atigun Pass, Alaska, on July 4, 1977, just before midnight. Because Atigun Pass is located north of the Arctic Circle, the midnight sun can be seen much of the summer.Over the period of January 5-9, 1998, residents of a large part of the eastern United States and Canada encountered a rainfall event that greatly affected their lives. Unlike most rain events, the falling drops froze immediately upon hitting the surface to form a continuous layer of smooth, white ice. The ice became so thick that it caused tree branches to break, power lines to snap, and roads to become impassable. The freezing rain was so widespread and the damage so pervasive that millions of residents in New England, New York State, and the Canadian province of Quebec lost electrical power. In Quebec alone, 3 million people-40 percent of the population-were without power, and damage estimates were in the neighborhood of $1 billion. One of those who endured the outage, Mr. Andre Champagne of Montreal, described it thusly: "It's so dark, it's like I'm on Mars."There were numerous other consequences to the storm-all of them bad. In the southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states the rain caused extensive flooding, in part because of direct runoff into rivers. The percolation of rainwater into the existing snowpack caused rapid melt, which further exacerbated the flooding problem. Four states called in the National Guard. And there was no shortage of unhappy cattle, as the loss of electricity made it impossible for farmers to milk their cows-causing more than a million dollars in agricultural losses. More than 30 people in the United States and Canada died as a result of the storm.The cold, winter storm of January 1998 offers a vivid contrast to the severe weather outbreak that hit the northern United States and southern Canada on May 30 and 31, when tornadoes, hail, and lightning killed at least 17 people. Such storms, though possible any time during the year, are most prevalent in spring. And then there was the summer heat wave of July 1999 that spread its share of misery from eastern Canada down to the southern plains and southeastern portion of the United States. More than 250 people died across the United States over the 2-week episode.As these examples show, many sorts of severe weather can create widespread havoc, but each is more likely to occur at some particular time of the year. Even in the absence of severe weather, our lives are profoundly influenced by the seasonal cycle that occurs each year. But as important as the changes of the seasons are to everyday activities, many of us do not really understand what causes them. In many cases we incorrectly think we know what causes them. For example, many people believe that variations in the distance between Earth and the Sun are responsible for changes in the seasons, with summer occurring when Earth and the Sun are closest together. But Earth and the Sun are closest to each other on or about January 3-in the midst of the Northern Hemisphere winter! Likewise, the Sun is farthest from Earth on July 3, a time Northern Hemisphere residents associate not with winter, but with long, hot days, barbecues, and fireworks. Obviously, then, there must be another explanation. In this chapter we describe exactly how Earth's orbit about the Sun produces our seasons. We begin with some of the basics.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/11/2880/737428.cw/index.html<TEXT>A mirage in southern New Mexico.It was early morning on October 24, 1998, and Tropical Storm Mitch had just intensified into a true hurricane in the western Atlantic. While it was certain to forecasters that the storm would strengthen further and move westward, nobody knew that within a few days Mitch would become the worst hurricane to hit Central America since 1780. Its ultimate devastation was hard to comprehend. Early death toll estimates would exceed 11,000 people, with thousands of others missing. Wind gusts of more than 320 km/hr (200 mph) and rainfall amounts greater than 50 cm (20 in.) ravaged many villages. Worst hit was Honduras, where more than 20 percent of the population was suddenly homeless. The mountainous terrain of Nicaragua was particularly hard hit by devastating mudslides. A farmer, Josa Morales, recounted his experience with one of the worst of them, the Casitas mudslide in northwestern Nicaragua: "It was a ball of earth and trees, and suddenly I couldn't see houses anymore." (See Figure 3-1.)The misery caused by Hurricane Mitch will last long after its most unfortunate victims were buried. With 70 percent of the crops destroyed in Honduras and a similar percentage of the transportation infrastructure demolished, recovery will be a very long, slow process. Some relief experts have estimated that it will be 15 to 20 years before the effects of the storm are fully undone. And in the short run, the battered nations of the region will have to contend with epidemics of cholera, malaria, and dengue fever-not to mention the widespread hunger from the ruined crops.Like other major hurricanes, Mitch covered an area greater than a quarter of a million square kilometers, lasted for about a week, dumped millions of tons of rainwater, and brought winds capable of wiping out whole villages. Such activity requires an enormous amount of energy and, as we saw in Chapter 2, solar radiation provides virtually all of that energy. But there is more to the story, because most of the energy contained in the atmosphere does not accrue by the direct absorption of solar radiation. Instead, the majority of the energy comes indirectly from the Sun after first having been absorbed by Earth's surface. From there, several processes combine to transfer this absorbed energy to the atmosphere. In this chapter we examine this energy transfer, which provides the fuel for everyday weather and for catastrophic events such as Hurricane Mitch.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/11/2880/737513.cw/index.html<TEXT>Despite the snowstorm on the afternoon of January, 9, 1997, air traffic into and out of Detroit Metropolitan Airport continued as normal, just as it had throughout the Midwest. Shortly before 4 P.M., Comair Flight 3272 was approaching for landing. The flight, which took off about an hour earlier from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, had proceeded normally until the pilot suddenly lost control of the aircraft. According to witnesses such as Ted Rath, who watched the horrifying scene, the twin-engine plane rolled three times and then crashed into a field 18 miles short of Runway 3. There were no survivors among the 29 passengers and crew.Air safety experts immediately suspected icing as the cause of the accident. Further evidence, such as the fact that the aircraft had encountered two previous failures of its de-icing system, added further support to the suspicion. The National Transportation Safety Board ultimately concluded that a coating of ice on the plane's wings and a low approach speed caused the plane to lose the necessary aerodynamic lift.Although other crashes have been caused by aircraft icing, these incidents are extremely rare. However, the fact remains that weather conditions can pose significant problems to aviation. Dangerous weather most often takes the form of extreme turbulence or rapidly changing wind conditions. Sometimes even relatively mild conditions can present significant risks, as was the case near Detroit. Even a mere fog bank or layer of overcast clouds can reduce visibility and pose a threat to safe ground and air travel. This is just one of the innumerable ways in which water plays a commanding role for life on Earth. Despite the fact that clouds and fog are common to our everyday lives, many of us have a weak understanding of how they form.Water is unique not only because it occurs naturally near Earth's surface in its solid, liquid, and gaseous phases, but also because it can change between these phases in a fairly short period of time. In fact, on average, a molecule of water vapor in the atmosphere will exist in its gaseous phase for only a few days before condensing to liquid droplets or ice crystals to form clouds or fog. Clouds and fog likewise have limited lifespans, and often evaporate away or precipitate much of their moisture within a few hours of their formation.This chapter opens Part II of the book, "Water in the Atmosphere," by describing the fundamentals of atmospheric moisture. It lays out the processes by which water can change from one phase to another and describes the common measures by which we express humidity. The chapter also describes the fundamentals involved in fog and cloud formation. Chapter 5 describes the processes of cloud development and the resultant cloud forms. Chapter 6 discusses how cloud droplets grow large enough to fall as precipitation. Thus the topics discussed here are vital to understanding some of the most common weather phenomena, as well as those that sometimes lead to major human impacts</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/11/2881/737556.cw/index.html<TEXT>All of us pay special attention to clouds at one time or another. Some are particularly beautiful, while others portend severe weather. But there are certain people who do a lot more than passively observe certain clouds. These storm chasers set out in teams during the severe weather season with the goal of observing the formation and movement of tornadoes. Some storm chasers are nonprofessional weather enthusiasts, while others are trained meteorologists with advanced degrees or students working toward their credentials. The latter group goes out not just for the thrill of witnessing severe weather firsthand (though one can't deny that the excitement accounts for much of the pursuit), but to acquire information that is important to our overall understanding of these phenomena. Using a combination of tools ranging from advanced technology to sheer intuition, professional storm chasers pursue potentially severe storms to understand the mechanisms within and near clouds that lead to tornado development. These efforts have provided valuable information that has helped meteorologists understand what parts of active thunderstorm clouds are most likely to produce tornadoes. These efforts have also revealed that large areas of rotation within storm clouds often precede tornado formation by about 20 minutes to half an hour-thus providing advanced warning to forecasters and the public.Storm chasing came of age in the spring of 1979, with the undertaking of the Severe Environmental Storms and Mesoscale Experiment (SESAME) in the central United States. Scientists working with the project assembled information from radar units, weather balloons, and field observations. By a remarkable coincidence, the season in which the project was undertaken coincided with one of the most devastating tornadoes ever to hit the region. During the afternoon of April 10, several teams of storm chasers outside of Seymore, Texas, observed a wall cloud, a large protrusion extending below the main base of a thunderstorm where tornadoes commonly develop. Howard Bluestein, now one of the leading experts on the subject of severe storms, photographed the particular wall cloud shown in Figure 5-1. Soon afterward, a tornado occurred that the storm chasers were able to observe from its inception to its demise, about 15 minutes later. But the main event was soon to follow. Off to the northeast another tornado had just formed. Though the observation teams tried to keep pace, the storm outran them as it tracked toward Wichita Falls. When the chasers arrived in town, they witnessed the horrible destruction that had occurred minutes before: Three thousand homes were destroyed and 42 people killed. But the tornado was still swirling in full force and moving northeast. As it continued out of Wichita Falls, the chasers saw the back side of the storm, which Bluestein describes as looking like an atomic bomb explosion.Most clouds are far less interesting than those that spawn tornadoes. Yet even clouds associated with the most violent weather result from the same processes that cause condensation and deposition in fair weather clouds. From Chapter 4 we know that condensation or deposition can occur by adding water vapor to the air; mixing warm, moist air with cold air; or lowering the air temperature to the dew point. Although the first two processes can lead to cloud formation in many situations, lowering of air temperature is the most important (especially for clouds that cause precipitation). This chapter discusses the processes and conditions associated with the formation of clouds due to upward motions. It also describes the cloud types that form as a result of those processes.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/11/2881/737598.cw/index.html<TEXT>Aerial view of a rainshaft in a thunderstorm.We often think of heavy rainfall and its environmental impacts as brief, passing events. A sudden downpour can create heavy flooding in a matter of minutes, but the danger is usually over in an hour or so. Sometimes, however, preexisting environmental conditions can cause a rainstorm to have an impact far more serious than usual. The widespread flooding in the Midwestern United States in 1993 provides an excellent example.The setting for the severe flooding began in the fall of 1992, when persistent rains saturated the soil across the north-central United States. The rainy autumn was followed by a deep accumulation of winter snow. The combination of deep snowpack atop saturated soil always presents a flooding hazard for the melt season, but 1993 proved to be worse than anybody could have imagined because the melt season was followed by unusually heavy rainfall during June and July.The magnitude of the flooding was unprecedented. At St. Louis, Missouri, the Mississippi River crested at 6 m (19.5 ft) above flood stage. The river, normally about 800 m (0.5 mi) wide near St. Joseph, Missouri, stretched out to as much as 10 km (6 mi), putting nearly half of St. Charles County under water (Figure 6-1). At Kansas City, Missouri, the Missouri River rose 6.7 m (22 ft) above its banks. Across the Midwest, tens of thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed by the flooding, as entire neighborhoods and 77 small towns ended up under water. The flooding even brought its share of irony: Des Moines, Iowa, was without potable water for 12 days because of contaminated floodwaters. Forty-year-old Jacki Meek of suburban St. Louis probably spoke for all of the 85,000 people who had to evacuate their homes: "I feel about 65 right now. I see my house on the news, and I just cry."Rain and other forms of precipitation are a fact of life for everybody, although usually they are of far less consequence than the floods of 1993. In fact, the quest for an answer to the question of what causes precipitation may have been one of the reasons you picked up this book. In Chapter 5 you learned about the processes that lead to the formation of all clouds, precipitating or nonprecipitating. In this chapter we explain the processes by which nonprecipitating cloud droplets and ice crystals grow large enough to fall as precipitation.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/11/2880/737470.cw/index.html<TEXT>The Moon rises over Mt. Everest, viewed from Annapurna base camp. At the top of Everest, air pressure is about one-third of that at sea level.Wind can have a direct impact on how we feel even under the mildest of weather conditions. A gentle breeze can make a hot afternoon more comfortable, or it can make a winter night bitter cold. But occasionally, the movement of air can impact our lives in far more substantial ways. Residents of eastern Washington and Oregon were reminded of this on September 25, 1999, when winds up to 135 km/hr (85 mph) created a blinding dust storm that triggered a spate of accidents. Over the course of the day, 6 people were killed and 23 injured, and miles of highway were completely shut down for hours. The worst of the multiple-vehicle accidents occurred along Interstate Highway 84 in northeastern Oregon. Fifty-eight-year-old Harold Fell described his experience: "An 18-wheeler passed us and the next thing I knew, it was stopped dead in the road. It just loomed up in front of me." Fell and his wife suffered minor injuries, but they undoubtedly realized how lucky they were when they surveyed the wreckage and realized that 4 people were dead amid the wreckage of the 16 vehicles involved.As concerned as we sometimes are with wind conditions, few of us pay much attention to a closely associated component of weather-atmospheric pressure. After all, how many times have you canceled a picnic because the pressure was too low? Or how many people do you know who have special clothes they wear only on days of high pressure?Although seldom considered in everyday life, air pressure deeply affects other weather variables that have much more immediate impact. For example, horizontal variations in atmospheric pressure are directly responsible for the motion of the wind. And because air descends in areas of high surface pressure and rises in regions of low surface pressure, differences in air pressure strongly influence the likelihood of cloud formation and precipitation.This chapter introduces the basic concepts of atmospheric pressure and its vertical and horizontal distributions. We discuss the relationship between pressure and other atmospheric variables and the processes that create horizontal and vertical variations in pressure. With this foundation we can go on to discuss storm patterns in later chapters.A blizzard complicates life on Wall Street, New York City.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/11/2881/737641.cw/index.html<TEXT>During the summer of 1999, vast portions of the eastern United States and Canada experienced several weeks of searing heat, with temperatures persistently well above 38  C (100  F). These high temperatures combined with minimal rainfall exacerbated a water shortage that had begun during the dry summer of 1998. By mid-1999, much of the region, especially in the mid-Atlantic states, was in the midst of its worst drought in decades. River flows and reservoir levels were critically low, forcing several eastern governors to declare drought emergencies outlawing non-essential water use, such as the watering of lawns and washing cars.Agricultural losses were estimated to be $800 million. The heat and drought severely reduced crop harvests for many farmers. Others endured a different problem: unusually early ripening of produce that caused an early glut and reduced prices. These low prices kept farmers such as Dale Benson of Delaware from selling his produce at local auctions.The drought also brought about some unexpected animal behavior. Black bears, for example, wandered into suburban areas outside major eastern cities in search of food. One bear was spotted a mere 15 km (10 mi) from downtown Baltimore, and another broke into a family's kitchen near Stillwater, New Jersey.Events such as these typically result from pressure patterns that, once established, persist for unusually long periods of time. Relief comes only when the pressure pattern evolves to permit wetter conditions. In Chapter 7 we saw that atmospheric pressure varies from one place to another, but its distribution is not haphazard. Instead, well-defined patterns dominate the distribution of pressure and winds across the global surface. The largest-scale patterns, called the general circulation, can be considered the background against which unusual events occur, such as the drought described above. Likewise, even mundane daily wind and pressure variations can be thought of as departures from the general circulation.Our first goal in this chapter is to describe the dominant planetary wind motions and look at the processes that generate them. In particular, we examine the interrelationships between the winds of the upper and lower atmosphere and the important connections that occur at the boundary between the surface of the oceans and the lower atmosphere. We then consider wind and pressure patterns at sequentially smaller spatial and temporal scales. The chapter concludes with a discussion of air-sea interactions.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/0,7836,737685-,00.html <TEXT>A cold, damp air mass over Ketchikan, Alaska.Nobody ever expects warm winters in Alaska, but sometimes conditions are even more severe than usual. This was particularly true in late January and early February of 1999, when a prolonged period of extreme cold produced the worst cold snap in a decade. Galena, in the northern part of the state, just missed an all-time low temperature when the reading dipped to -53  C (-64  F) in February. Conditions were so extreme that the city government officially closed down, maintaining only emergency services. If that wasn't cold enough, consider the -75  C (-103  F) wind chill factor at Kotzebue along the northwestern coast! Things weren't exactly balmy in Fairbanks, either, when on February 15 the low temperature dipped below -37  C (-35  F) for a record-breaking nineteenth consecutive day. Needless to say, the air was also extremely dry, as is always the case under cold conditions.Contrast those conditions with those experienced in Texas half a year earlier. College Station, by way of example, had its warmest May, June, and July average temperatures ever, as maximum temperatures exceeded 38  C (100  F) 51 times between May 31 and September 3. The heat was further compounded by high humidities and unusually sparse rainfall throughout the period.Have you ever wondered about episodes such as the one above, in which large areas experience more or less similar weather? At times like these, broadcasters use phrases such as "throughout the Midwest," or "across the eastern seaboard," or "Today the Pacific Northwest experienced . . . ." By way of contrast, it often happens that places within an hour's drive of each other have very different weather, with essentially nothing in common. What's the explanation for this behavior? Why does the atmosphere sometimes organize itself into broad uniform patches, and other times show extreme variation over short distances? This chapter addresses these and related questions using some very simple, but nevertheless powerful concepts.The Alaska and Texas situations cited above represent two extreme instances in which large regions are covered by a body of air having more or less uniform temperature and moisture. These large volumes of air are called air masses. Often an area the size of North America will be covered by several air masses at the same time so that, for example, the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada may experience cold, dry conditions, while the southern United States is dominated by warm, moist air. Thus a person might board an airplane in Nashville feeling perfectly comfortable in shirt sleeves, only to end up shivering in Boston. Moreover, these air masses are commonly separated from each other by fairly narrow boundary regions, called fronts, across which conditions change rapidly. The passage of these fronts are significant weather events because they often bring abrupt changes in temperature, humidity, and wind. They also provide a lifting mechanism that can lead to the formation of clouds and precipitation.In this chapter we describe the formation and nature of air masses, the fronts that separate them, and their influences on local weather.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/11/2881/737726.cw/index.html <TEXT>A color-enhanced image of a major storm over Great Britain.Less than a week before the end of 1999, as people everywhere fretted about the Y2K computer bug, much of Europe was shaken by a natural event unrelated to the turning of the calendar. The most powerful European storm in 50 years hit Europe with winds that topped 190 km/hr (110 mph). It brought power outages to nearly 2 million households, shut down three nuclear power plants, and crippled much of France's air and land transportation systems. Worse still, 97 people from across western Europe died from the storm, mostly from falling or flying debris. When asked about the situation, one of the city workers cleaning up the debris, David Chazeaud, said, "Since I was born, I've never seen anything like that storm. All over Paris there are problems like this."Among the European countries, France was the worst hit-both in terms of loss of life and material damage. Many of Paris's most famous landmarks were badly damaged, and 10,000 trees were toppled in Versailles. Germany, Switzerland, and Great Britain also sustained major damage and numerous fatalities.Although European forecasters saw the storm approaching from the Atlantic and predicted that it would reach the continent, they did not expect its winds to be as severe as they were by the time it made landfall. As is the case with the west coast of North America, weather forecasting in Europe is complicated by the paucity of weather stations over the expanse of ocean to the west of the continent-a fact sometimes overlooked by the public. No sooner had the criticism started to mount over the understated forecast than another, even stronger, storm arrived 2 days later, killing at least 22 more people. Thus one very rare event was followed very shortly by a second. This rare combination of events should remind us that regardless of the technological sophistication of the twenty-first century, we are still subject to the random whims of nature.The two storm systems brought hurricane-force winds but were distinctly different from hurricanes. Unlike hurricanes, which originate over tropical waters, these mid-latitude cyclones originate in the middle or high latitudes and are marked by well-defined fronts separating two dissimilar air masses. This chapter describes the mid-latitude cyclones that are a common and important feature of the weather outside the Tropics.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/11/2881/737768.cw/index.html<TEXT>hailstorm in Garmish, Germany.It is hard to imagine anybody failing to be impressed by the beauty-as well as the danger-brought about by a thunderstorm. Spectacular though they may be, such storms are not rare. In fact, they are common throughout the world and occur about 40,000 times each day. Although their frequency varies greatly from place to place, virtually every location on Earth is vulnerable to thunder and lightning from time to time.Lightning can create inconveniences-such as blowing out all the electrical appliances in a house. It can also do considerable damage, such as starting forest fires. And, of course, it can kill; during an average year, about 200 people are killed by lightning in the United States and Canada. But considering that the population of these two countries approaches 300 million people, it is easy to see that your chances of being struck are extremely remote.Yet people do get hit by lightning. Consider the experience of the McQuilken family on their trip to Sequoia National Park, California, in August 1975. As the sky began to darken, Sean, Michael, and their sister Mary noticed their hair standing on end. Recognizing the apparent comedy of the situation, the boys posed for the photograph shown in Figure 11-1. Hail followed almost immediately. Then lightning struck-literally-and Sean was knocked unconscious. Michael quickly administered artificial respiration, which probably saved Sean's life. Another victim was less fortunate, however. The lightning had apparently forked off, with another branch hitting two nearby people, one of whom was killed.But the effects of lightning and thunder are eclipsed by an even greater menace-tornadoes. We will now examine how, where, and why violent weather occurs, and we'll look at the situations that cause some storms to be weak and others to become destructive and deadly.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/11/2882/737810.cw/index.html<TEXT>Nobody who lived in southern Florida during the August 1992 passage of Hurricane Andrew (Figure 12-1) will ever forget the experience. Andrew was fairly small but remarkably powerful, with wind gusts of up to 280 km/hr (175 mph) that moved rapidly across the peninsula. In one regard Andrew was not as destructive as many other hurricanes; although it did cause some local flooding, it did not yield extremely heavy rainfall. This contrasts strongly with Florida's experience with Hurricane Irene in October 1999.Irene was typical of the strong tropical storms that form in the latter part of hurricane season: large and slow-moving. Although these storms lack the wind speeds of storms such as Andrew, they can bring heavy rainfall for days and cause extensive flooding. In the case of Irene, much of southern Florida received up to 27 cm (17 in.) of rainfall that produced widespread flooding. Nadia Gorriz of Miami-Dade County was among the many victims. Eight months pregnant, she took on the task of cleaning up the mud that accumulated inside her house. The job was made more difficult by the fact that a swamp formed around her house, providing living quarters for snakes and fish. She put the cleanup in perspective: "We made it through Andrew. You just threw everything out and there wasn't that much water. This is the worst cleanup. We've gone through two gallons of Clorox II. So far."Hurricanes do not restrict their fury to coastal and inland regions; they have been the nemesis of mariners for centuries. They have sunk an untold number of ships and even played an important role in World War II when a single typhoon (the equivalent of a hurricane over the western Pacific) sank or heavily damaged several American ships, destroyed hundreds of carrier-based aircraft, and killed more than 800 sailors. The death toll exceeded that of most naval battles during the war.In this chapter we first describe the setting for hurricanes and tropical storms. We then describe their general characteristics, stages in development, and typical patterns of movement, concluding with hurricane monitoring and warning systems.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/11/2882/737852.cw/index.html<TEXT>Forecasters for the National Weather Service (NSW) spend a large portion of their workdays fielding telephone inquiries about upcoming weather. Sometimes people want to know if their round of golf is likely to be rained out or if their outdoor plants might be vulnerable to overnight frost damage. But the most important aspects of a forecaster's job do not involve matters of simple convenience, but questions that deal with life-and-death matters.Such was the case for Mark Moede, meteorologist with the NWS Forecast Office in San Diego. In late August 1998 much of southern California was threatened by brush fires triggered by unusually heavy thunderstorm activity. Firefighters battling the blazes received constant updates on weather conditions that could either suppress or enhance the spread of the fire. On September 2 the situation reached its most critical stage. Pete Curran of the Orange County Fire Department maintained close contact with Moede for constant updates on a line of approaching thunderstorms. At issue was whether the thunderstorms would continue to strengthen and whether they would pass through the areas where the firefighters were working. If the storms passed that way, then strong winds, deadly lightning and blinding rains would place Curran's crews in jeopardy. With the aid of Doppler radar and information from automated weather stations, Moede made the right call. He advised Curran to evacuate his crews from the eventual path of the storm, where winds in excess of 95 km/hr (60 mph) created an uncontrollable firestorm. Afterward firefighters reported that the fire line they had evacuated had been completely burned over. If the call to evacuate had not been made, in all likelihood a number of firefighters would have been killed.This chapter discusses the methods by which forecasters perform their job. We first look at some important issues regarding the general concept of weather forecasting and then discuss ways in which necessary data are obtained and processed. We then study the various types of weather maps and how they are used in weather analysis.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/0,7836,737896-,00.html <TEXT>Massive fires over Indonesia in the summer and fall of 1997 caused extreme air pollution that spread into Malaysia and Thailand.With 18 million people and 3.5 million cars, most of which are not equipped with modern emission-control devices, it is little wonder that Mexico City is one of the smoggiest places on Earth. Surrounded by mountains that confine the polluted air and subject to frequent temperature inversions that inhibit vertical dispersion of pollutants, Mexico City has all the right ingredients for a serious smog problem. But the spring of 1998 brought prolonged periods of unhealthful air quality that were extreme even for this city. The smog crisis was brought on primarily by a rash of forest fires in southern Mexico. To make matters worse, Popocatepetl volcano, 50 km (30 mi) southeast of the city, spewed tons of smoke and ash into the region. Wind transported the pollution south to Honduras and north all the way to Florida and Texas, where people were advised to stay indoors to mitigate health hazards.Normally, Mexico City's worst smog occurs in January and February, when stagnant air traps automobile and other urban pollutants near the surface. Smog levels decline somewhat by springtime, although the slash-and-burn methods of field clearance used by farmers makes the air quality worse than it would be otherwise. But in 1998 a major drought, believed by many to have resulted from the strong El Nino, created particularly dry conditions that caused the fires to cover three times their normal area. By May the polluted air forced automobile drivers to use their headlights in the middle of the day in the state capital of Chiapas, and in Mexico City extreme ozone concentrations brought a dramatic surge in the number of people seeking medical care for respiratory problems. In response, the government exercised emergency powers that restricted automobile traffic and closed down many factories. However, that was not enough to make conditions tolerable for Pedro Chavez, who said, "You notice it in your eyes, in the tiredness you feel. Our children are getting sick more often. . . . If we could, we would leave, but this is where our business is."The effects of human activities are not restricted to air quality degradation. We change the atmosphere in more subtle ways as well. For example, the construction of cities influences the way energy and water are exchanged near the surface. Every time a subdivision is laid out, natural soil and vegetation are replaced by concrete or asphalt. This greatly reduces the amount of water that can evaporate into the air and thereby increases the sensible heat flux (Chapter 3) to the atmosphere. We also build structures with vertical walls that receive sunlight at a more direct angle than the original absorbing surface. These processes work to increase the temperature of urban areas relative to their rural counterparts, creating the heat islands that we describe later in the chapter.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/0,7836,737939-,00.html <TEXT>Although we don't always know in advance what type of weather will occur at any particular place on a particular day, we do have some idea of what type of weather is considered normal for a given location. For example, Florida typically has hot, humid summers and mild winters-although cold spells do occur from time to time. But there are times when truly anomalous weather events occur in some particular location, events that defy our expectations. These may take the form of unusual heat or cold, but may also appear as severe weather events uncommon to a particular region. Such an event occurred in Salt Lake City, Utah, on August 11, 1999, when an F2 tornado roared through the downtown area.Tornadoes are not unknown in Utah; they occur on average about twice a year, but they almost always are classified as "weak" tornadoes, F0 or F1. The Salt Lake City tornado was an F2 that covered a 3-km (2-mi) path. The tornado brought winds in excess of 180 km/hr (110 mph) to the downtown area, toppling trees, knocking over tractor trailers, and damaging more than 120 homes. The Delta Center (the home of the Utah Jazz basketball team) and the Salt Palace Convention Center were among the more notable structures damaged. David Gross, who was inside the Convention Hall, reported that, "The roof opened and it [the wind] ripped off a door. It was over in 15 or 20 seconds, but it seemed like a lot longer than that."One man was killed by flying debris in a large tent set up for an outdoor retailers convention. The victim was believed to be the first fatality from a tornado in Utah's recorded history. One hundred other people were injured, and 40 of them required hospitalization.Of course, the climate we associate with an area involves more than just severe weather; it concerns the entire range of weather conditions in the area. Climate deals with long-range conditions, as opposed to the passage of daily weather occurrences. In this chapter we examine the issues involved in classifying climate, and we describe the broad climatic regions across the globe.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://wps.prenhall.com/esm_aguado_uwac_3/11/2882/737980.cw/index.html <TEXT>Imagine you live on the southern margin of Greenland in the thirteenth century. Among the Viking pioneers, your family's livelihood revolves around fishing, hunting, and domestic animals-chiefly sheep, which feast on grasses flourishing in the long summer days. But gradually, over decades, climatic conditions deteriorate from what has been the normal pattern. Winter storms become more frequent and severe, with heavy snows far more common. The growing season shrinks as the number of frost-free days decreases. Increasing sea ice limits fishing and forces long-used sailing routes to be abandoned in favor of more southerly paths. Eventually winter dominates the entire year and food shortages are the rule. Faced with these changes, your family retreats to warmer Scandinavian climates, leaving behind generations of deceased relatives, buried in what will soon become permafrost.Thinking about this, one cannot help but wonder if there are implications for the present. Although modern societies certainly have greater adaptive capability than the Viking settlers, we are hardly immune to the effects of climate change. (After all, a cooperative climate is still necessary for almost all food production.) It is therefore not surprising that the topic of climatic change has received tremendous scientific and media attention in recent years. In large part this attention arises out of concern for possible human impacts on climate, but also because of interest in natural climatic change, as might be associated with El Ninos and volcanic eruptions. In this, the final chapter of the text, we will review past climates, the factors that might be responsible for climate change, the methods used to infer past climates, and the use of general circulation models to study potential human effects.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.gcrio.org/CONSEQUENCES/fall95/mod.html <TEXT>We often hear the assertion that our extensive use of carbon- based fuels now threatens to alter the climate of the whole world: that enhanced greenhouse warming--induced by the carbon dioxide and other gases we have added to the air--will lead to a rapid and unprecedented rise in the average temperature of the Earth within the next fifty years.We are not accustomed to long-term forecasts of anything of such consequence. Nor can it be surprising that the initial reaction of almost anyone is to question the reliability of the prediction. For what is claimed--if indeed an accurate portrayal of the future-- seems to leave few choices: do we prepare ourselves for the impacts of lasting climate change? Should we rethink our own use of coal and oil and natural gas and gasoline, when energy use, as we all know, is very much tied to economic growth?What must trouble many decision-makers is that the sounding of this loud environmental alarm was tripped not so much by measurements as by computer models. How certain or how controversial are these largely theoretical predictions of global warming, and on what assumptions are they based? Given the potential importance of regional climate changes for the development of national policies, and the impacts of extreme, climate-related weather events such as droughts, floods, and hurricanes on agriculture and human safety, how reliable are the projections of future change? Are the uncertainties in present climate models so great that we can ignore their predictions? What elements are the most robust? What are the prospects for substantial improvements in climate models in the near future?These questions, so often asked, were put to a group of scientists in late 1994 in response to requests from both the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) which was responding, in turn, to a request from Congressmen John Dingell of Michigan. The charge to the Forum, which I chaired at the request of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, was to develop a statement on the credibility of modeled projections of climate change, to provide background to the government for considering and developing national policy options. The participants included climate modelers and other knowledgeable scientists who were chosen to bring to the Forum a wide spectrum of scientific opinion regarding the potential threat of global greenhouse warming. This review provides the author's summary of the Forum report, which is listed as a reference at the end of the article.BackgroundGeneral circulation modelsComputer-run, mathematical simulations or models of the atmosphere and ocean are the principal tool for predicting the response of the climate to increases in greenhouse gases. The most sophisticated of these, called general circulation models, or GCMs, express in mathematical form what is known of the processes that dictate the behavior of the atmosphere and the ocean. GCMs include the interaction of the atmosphere with the oceans and with the surface of the Earth, including plants and other ground cover. They allow us to test, by mathematical simulation, what should happen to climate, around the world, in response to a wide variety of changes. For example, what climatic effects would follow a major volcanic eruption, or a change in the radiation from the Sun?The great power of mathematical models lies in their ability to simulate the behavior of systems--like the atmosphere and ocean-- that are too complex or extensive for simple, intuitive reasoning. There are limits, however, to how much complexity can be handled by the computers on which the models are run. At present, models of the global climate system cannot include physical processes whose horizontal dimensions are less than several hundred miles--a constraint that imposes simplifications on how well we can model what we know and restrictions on the level of regional detail. The key is to incorporate the best possible representation of all the important processes and feedbacks necessary to characterize the climate system, while keeping within the practical capabilities of modern computers.Our ability to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of climate models has grown over the last two decades. A growing number of GCMs, many with independently derived components, are available for intercomparison. We have a growing store of meteorological and oceanic observations against which model predictions can be tested. We also have information on past climate change, recorded by natural processes in rocks and sediments, that allow us to assess the ability of models to replicate the known features of climates different from that of the present day. Each of these elements is the basis for debate on the reliability of climate model projections of the future climate.Consensus predictionsAll of the GCM experiments designed to assess the impact of increases of greenhouse gases point to global warming through the coming century, with accompanying changes in rainfall and other meteorological quantities. Still, the complexity of the climate system is a tremendous obstacle to predicting future climate change. Neither climatological observations nor present climate models is sufficient to project how climate will change with certainty. A workable approach is that adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, which is based on projections of the expected growth of greenhouse gases and the combined results of many GCMs. In terms of mean global surface temperature, the consensus prediction of the IPCC is for an increase of 0.5 to 2  Centigrade (about 1 to 3.5  Fahrenheit) by the year 2050, in response to an anticipated increase of 1 percent per year in CO2. The low end is a significant change; the high end, a dramatic one. Moreover, were the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide to double, the consensus forecast is for an eventual warming of 1.5 to 4.5 C (about 3 to 8 F.)Such changes, if realized, would represent a significant climatic change. For example, the most recent climate change of similar magnitude was the last major Ice Age that reached its peak about 18,000 years ago. The mean global temperature during that time is estimated to have been between 3 and 4  C cooler than at present. The effect of this small a change in global-mean temperature can be appreciated when we realize that during the last Ice Age, glacial ice--a mile or more deep--covered much of North America, year-round, reaching as far south as the Great Lakes and the surrounding states of present-day America. That amount of change in global-mean temperature is similar, although opposite in sign, to what is now projected due to increases in greenhouse gases. But the rate of change is not. The last Ice Age developed over thousands of years, while global greenhouse warming is projected to occur within a span of less than a century. And within the lifetime of people now living.It is equally clear that in terms of potential impact, the difference between a 1.5  and a 4.5  C projection for future warming is very large. As a result of this uncertainty, decision- makers are confronted with a difficult question. What steps should be taken when the best indications from state-of-the-science models suggest that climate change due to human activities may be large and significant, yet the predictions are less than certain?The scientific debate regarding these uncertainties has entered the public arena, providing considerable confusion even for those aspects of climate-model predictions that are virtually certain. The debate over how much warming--and by when, and why it hasn't yet been more clearly seen--has clouded the clearer picture that increases in carbon dioxide will increase the global-mean temperature. It has also affixed the stamp of "controversial" on almost any reference to impending global warming in the press and news media, implying, erroneously, that the general concept, and not just the details, is in serious doubt.A method for evaluationIt is possible to get an indication of the strength of a building or other structure if we know which of its footings are solid and which are less so: in this case, to separate the aspects of predicted climate change that are virtually certain from those that are uncertain. The Forum carried out this kind of assessment of predicted global warming, to provide better illumination for policy discussions and to assist policy development.The evaluation is divided into three parts. The first provides a basis for any discussion of climate-model predictions by identifying the foundations of the greenhouse warming theory that are most solid and robust: a series of conclusions which can be viewed as "virtually certain" based on observations, experiments, and the results of many models. The second part is a listing of specific predictions of climate models that are societally important, ranked by degree of certainty. In the last part we examine what can be done in the future to improve climate-model predictions.The FoundationAlthough the specific predictions of climate change are derived from models, the reasons for expecting significant global warming in the near future comes from a much deeper foundation that includes laboratory and field experiments, well-established knowledge of atmospheric behavior, and measurements that include worldwide monitoring of atmospheric conditions. Here we list seven of the principal scientific arguments for a global-warming prediction. Throughout, the stated conclusions are subject to little or no debate because of their level of certainty, and indeed, to some they may appear trivial.First, as confirmed in laboratory experiments, certain gases that are naturally present in small amounts in the atmosphere play an active role in maintaining the Earth's temperature. They do this by absorbing energy (infrared radiation) emitted from the land, ocean, clouds, and the atmosphere itself, and then re-emitting it. The most important of these so-called greenhouse gases are, in order, water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane, followed by nitrous oxide, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons (or CFCs), which are manmade compounds of chlorine, fluorine and carbon.Second, because they absorb radiated energy, increased concentrations of greenhouse gases will inevitably raise the Earth's temperature. The extent of the warming will depend on possible amplifying or damping mechanisms (feedback processes), particularly those involving water vapor and clouds, that are major players in controlling the natural greenhouse effect. Such feedbacks can change the magnitude of the warming, but there are no known cases where they bring about an opposite, cooling effect. Thus that greenhouse-gas increases will produce warming is not in question. The heart of the greenhouse debate concerns the nature and timing of temperature increase, and the associated changes and impacts of other climatic quantities, not the fact that increases in greenhouse gases will lead to a rise in global temperature.Third, the amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons present in the air today are significantly higher than their "pre-industrial" levels--that is, the amount that was present, naturally, before the intensive use of energy that began with the Industrial Revolution about 200 years ago. For example, the amount of carbon dioxide that is measured in the air throughout the world today is about 30 percent greater than that found in years before about 1800, as determined from the chemical analysis of air trapped in well-dated, polar ice cores. Similar findings apply to methane (which has increased by more than 100 percent) and to other greenhouse gases, with the possible exception of water vapor. The increases can be tied directly to human activities that include fossil-fuel burning (as for heating, or in internal combustion engines), the burning of trees to clear land, and certain agricultural and industrial practices.Fourth, it would take hundreds of years for the concentration of carbon dioxide to fall back to pre-industrial levels, even if the amount emitted were immediately and substantially reduced around the world. The reason is the slow pace of the natural processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Further, the projected growth in world population and energy use in the developing countries make it highly unlikely that any substantial reductions in total global carbon-dioxide emissions will take place over the next several decades. Thus the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is expected to continue to rise well into the 21st century. Similar arguments apply to most other greenhouse gases.Fifth, there are many more microscopic, airborne particles (known as aerosols) in the atmosphere than were present in pre-industrial times, concentrated in and downwind of areas of intensive human activity. Aerosols are present naturally in the atmosphere in the form of windblown dust from cultivated soils, hydrocarbons from vegetation and forests, and soot from forest and grassland fires. What has increased is the anthropogenic or human-made contribution: soot, sulfate aerosols and other particles found downwind from regions of intensive fossil-fuel combustion and biomass burning.Sixth, laboratory and atmospheric measurements demonstrate that sulfate aerosols (containing compounds of sulfur and oxygen) that come either from volcanic eruptions or fossil-fuel combustion exert a cooling influence on the climate, by reflecting some of the incoming solar radiation back into space. The increase in airborne particles cited above could thus offset some of the warming expected from the buildup of greenhouse gases, although the magnitude and extent of aerosol cooling is not known and is difficult to quantify, in part because the regional distribution and character of past and future emissions of aerosols are poorly known.Seventh, the globally averaged temperature at the surface of the Earth has risen about 1 F (or 0.5 C) in the last 100 years. Because of the natural variability of climate, the change cannot yet be ascribed unambiguously to the increase in greenhouse gases over the same period. Nor is the recorded temperature rise as great as that expected, based on climate-model results, from greenhouse warming, although some or all of the difference may be due to the cooling effect of aerosols, noted above, or to the action of other competing long-term effects.These seven findings form the basis for the conclusion of a vast majority of scientists that human activities are now modifying the energy balance of the Earth system. Less certain are the magnitude and the timing of the associated climate changes, which are derived from models and which are the subject of considerable debate.Climate Model PredictionsPredictions of future climate are imperfect because they are limited by significant uncertainties that stem from: (1) the natural variability of climate; (2) our inability to predict accurately future greenhouse-gas and aerosol emissions; (3) the potential for unpredicted or unrecognized factors, such as volcanic eruptions or new or unknown human influences, to perturb atmospheric conditions; and (4) our as-yet incomplete understanding of the total climate system. The reliability of climate-model predictions depends directly upon each of these.With this in mind we list below, in order of certainty, the major policy-relevant predictions of present climate models.Calculated changes in climate variables will obviously depend upon the assumptions made regarding the future concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which are a function of projected population growth and associated economic expansion. The modeled results that are given here assume that greenhouse- gas concentrations in the atmosphere will continue to increase in coming decades. For purposes of simplicity, the climate model used considers only carbon dioxide and assumes that it will increase 1 percent each year, which, for purposes of calculation, replicates the effect of the anticipated increases in the concentrations of all other greenhouse gases.A Ranked ListIn ranking its conclusions, the Forum adopted a system of four levels of certainty, as these terms are defined in general usage: virtually certain, very probable, probable, and uncertain.Virtually Certain:(1) The temperature of the stratosphere--an upper region of the atmosphere that extends from about ten to fifty kilometers (six to thirty miles) above the surface of the Earth--will be significantly cooled. This cooling comes about through the combined effect of increases in carbon dioxide and the observed depletion in stratospheric ozone, and the manner in which the two gases absorb and re-emit energy. Opposite in sign to what is expected near the ground, the change had been predicted by models and has now been observed. As such, it provides potential early evidence of greenhouse warming.Very Probable:(2) The surface temperature of the Earth will continue to rise through at least the middle of the 21st century. The prediction is based on (a) projected, continued increases in greenhouse-gas emissions; (b) the results from a host of model calculations; and (c) the analysis of past climates of the Earth. The best available estimate, from the international assessment by the IPCC and based on the range of available model predictions, is that the global-mean surface temperature will increase by about 0.5 to 2  C (roughly 1 to 3.5  F) over the period from 1990 to 2050 (Fig. 1). For comparison, an increase of 0.5  C--the lower limit--is equal to the warming that has taken place in the past 100 years. Beyond the year 2050, the carbon dioxide concentration is expected to reach twice that of pre- industrial times. When that level is reached, and after the climate has reached equilibrium, the best estimate for the resulting climate change is a warming of 1.5 to 4.5 C (about 3 to 8 F). The IPCC considers a mid-range increase of 2.5 C (5 F) the most probable result. The model calculations assume that the present levels of sulfur aerosol emissions (for example, from the burning of soft coal) will to some degree diminish in years ahead; if they do not, the temperature increase will be somewhat less. The actual temperature change could fall outside the ranges given here should natural climate variations happen to be large during the period of the prediction.(3) Higher surface temperatures will cause an increase in the average precipitation over the globe. This comes about because temperature affects the rate at which surface water is evaporated (to return to the ground in the form of rainfall and snow). While the connections between temperature and precipitation rates are well understood, the distribution of changes in precipitation over the Earth is less certain.(4) The amount of sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere will be diminished. Studies of past climates provide evidence for the polar amplification of either global warming or global cooling. The reason is a positive feedback loop that connects warming, reduction of sea ice, replacement of the highly reflective sea ice with a darker and more absorbing ocean surface, and hence additional warming (Fig. 2). For these reasons, it is very probable that the extent of sea ice in the polar regions of the Northern Hemisphere will be reduced by melting. Changes in corresponding areas of the Southern Hemisphere are less certain due to differences in ocean circulation and the presence of the Antarctic continent.(5) Land areas in the Arctic should experience amplified wintertime warming . The positive feedback loop noted in point 4 above also applies to the land. The magnitude of the surface warming there will also depend on how the normal transfer of heat by the atmosphere from the equator to the pole responds to global warming, and this point is uncertain.(6) Global warming will cause sea level to rise. This is expected as a consequence of three temperature-related changes: the physical expansion of sea water as the ocean temperature increases, the partial melting of mountain glaciers, and changes in the extent and thickness of the Antarctic and Arctic ice sheets. The expansion of sea water can be determined from the projected temperature change described above. Reasonable estimates of the retreat of mountain glaciers are also available, but calculations of the changes expected in polar ice caps are far less certain. Based on calculations of sea-water expansion and the retreat of mountain glaciers, and ignoring the possible long-term response of the polar ice caps or any potential catastrophic collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet, it is estimated that global sea level will rise from 5 to 40 centimeters (2 to 16 inches) by 2050. This projection compares to an anticipated rate of sea-level rise of 5-12 centimeters (5 inches) if currently observed rates of rise over the past century continue.(7) The climatic effect of any changes expected in the amount of energy radiated from the Sun in the course of the next fifty years is much smaller than that from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Based on current knowledge, the Sun's energy output varies by about 0.1 percent over the eleven-year sunspot cycle, and this variation can affect the surface temperature of the Earth. However, the effects of anticipated greenhouse warming are four to seven times greater than those that could result from these short-term changes in the total flow of energy from the Sun. Were the Sun's radiation to fall to the lowest levels yet measured and to remain there through the next fifty years, it could diminish the expected effects of greenhouse warming by about 25 percent. Were solar radiation to remain abnormally high throughout this time, which is about equally likely, it could add to the effect by at most the same amount.Probable:(8) Continental dryness will increase at middle latitudes in summer in the Northern Hemisphere. The basis for this prediction is the fact, cited earlier, that higher temperatures lead to much higher rates of evaporation: in net effect, the increase in evaporation will on a regional basis exceed the accompanying increase in rainfall. The amount of drying is qualified, however, by several factors that are not well represented in models. These include the movement of evaporated moisture from place to place through atmospheric circulation; the effects of changes in ground cover due to the response of vegetation to increased carbon dioxide; the role of aerosols; and interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere, including the storage of wintertime precipitation in soils.(9) Rain and snow at high latitudes will increase as the amount of moisture in the atmosphere is increased. The freshwater that is added there by precipitation could alter the deepwater circulation of the oceans, which is driven in part by differences in the salt content of different parts of the ocean and which in turn affects climate. Additional precipitation could also affect the size of the polar ice caps, and hence perturb sea-level.(10) The Antarctic and North Atlantic Oceans will warm more slowly than the global average. Changes in sea-surface temperature are moderated in regions such as these because of the regular mixing of the surface water with the deeper, cooler water of the ocean. They are thus the most logical sites for slower-than- average warming. The sea-surface temperatures there, however, will also depend on accompanying changes in precipitation and freshwater inputs that can change the rate of vertical mixing of the oceans.(11) The occasional eruption of a major volcano will temporarily diminish global warming, but for no more than a few years. Historical records indicate that the solid particles introduced into the stratosphere by volcanic eruptions can cool the mean temperature of the Earth by a few tenths of a degree C for up to a two or three years, during which time the particles are removed from the upper atmosphere. Such changes would constitute transient interruptions in the longer-term trend of greenhouse warming.Uncertain:(12) Changes in climate variability will occur. However, the exact nature of changes in climate variability due to greenhouse warming is as yet not well defined. All models predict a possible reduction in wintertime variability in warmer climates; it is also commonly predicted that thunderstorm activity should increase as a result of the increased moisture content of the atmosphere. The frequency of El Ni? o events could change as a result of a global warming, as could the frequency of atmospheric "blocking" events that set up persistent weather patterns that last weeks to months at a time.(13) Changes in the climate of regional-scale areas (from the size of large metropolitan regions to the scale of states or small countries) are likely to be quite different from the global average. We have only a very limited capability to estimate changes expected in the climate of any specific region. The spatial resolution of climate models is, as yet, too coarse to incorporate effects such as regional land characteristics, surface contours, and local hydrologic conditions, even though these factors are known to be important. Regional changes in climate can differ from global changes, but the nature of the probable differences is uncertain.(14) The intensity of tropical storms, including hurricanes, may increase. This can occur as a result of the effects of the higher sea-surface temperatures that are associated with global warming, because tropical storms derive their energy from temperature differences. However, there are simply too many unresolved issues--such as how possible changes in the poleward transport of heat may influence the amount of tropical warming--to predict more precisely what the effect will be. Whether the number of such tropical storms will also increase is also uncertain, in part because GCMs are not run at spatial resolution fine enough to simulate hurricane formation.(15) Forecasts of climate change over the next twenty-five years are as yet uncertain. Although such forecasts are much to be desired, present uncertainties in the factors that control the natural variability of climate, in the model simulations, and in expected changes in atmospheric chemistry make it extremely difficult to predict decade-to-decade changes in climate. In any given decade, the changes in temperature and related variables could be substantially less than or more than the predicted long-term trend. Warming estimates in terms of degrees per decade and the use of these trends to analyze a single decade are unwarranted and misleading.(16) Interactions between climate and vegetation may modify the magnitude of predicted greenhouse warming, but whether these effects will amplify or diminish climate change is as yet uncertain. The limited assessments that have been made suggest possible feedbacks due to climate-induced changes in vegetation, such as the replacement of high-latitude tundra by vegetation more characteristic of temperate latitudes, or the displacement of forests by grassland. Other climate impacts can result from the direct effects of enhanced carbon dioxide on plant growth, from impacts of tropical deforestation, and from the effects of plant productivity on atmospheric chemistry.Steps to Reduce the Uncertanties in Present ModelsThe uncertainties cited in the list above can provide a set of ordered priorities for improving present climate models. Given the compelling need for clearer answers, we can count on continued improvements. Yet, for many reasons--including the need for additional observational data-- significant reductions in many of the uncertainties will require sustained efforts over a decade or more.Much of the research effort of the multi-agency U.S. Global Change Research Program is designed to address the uncertainties cited here, including those that involve cloud-radiation-water vapor interactions, ocean circulation, aerosols, natural climate variability, land-surface processes that include vegetation changes and chemical cycling, the frequency and intensity of high-impact events such as hurricanes, factors that create the potential for surprises, and the interaction between chemistry and climate.Seven areas of improvement are described below that are likely to reduce uncertainties in GCM predictions over the coming decades. These should be viewed as opportunities for significant improvement in climate- model predictions.(1) The use of finer spatial resolution in climate models (see Fig. 3).Many of the uncertainties associated with the results of climate models stem from the relatively coarse spatial resolution that they employ--that is, the smallest element of the landscape for which input can be provided, or results obtained. In the present use of GCMs this is often 5  in latitude by 5  in longitude, or a square approximately 350 miles on a side, which is about the size of New Mexico or all of New England. Many advantages accrue at higher resolutions: storms and circulation patterns, for example, are significantly better represented--in part because of improved representation of land contours and characteristics, and in part because of the capability of including major weather-system processes. The same arguments apply to the ocean component of climate models.The use of finer resolution comes at the costs of longer computing time and greater data-handling requirements. Switching from a 5  x 5  grid to one with a resolution of 2.5  x 2.5  requires substantially more computing time. Each time the spatial resolution is doubled, eight times more computer time is required on the same machine. A calculation with 5  resolution might typically take ninety hours of continuous running on today's fastest supercomputers; the higher-resolution run would tie up the same supercomputer, night and day, for almost a month! It is not only cost that holds back the use of higher resolution: in many cases not enough is known about detailed processes to utilize a finer grid. The combination of increased availability of computer resources and of studies that elucidate the physical processes at finer resolution are very likely to bring substantial improvements in climate-model capability. They will also provide the opportunity to tailor predictions to specific regions.(2) Improved representations of the lowest layer of the atmosphere (the often turbulent and so-called boundary layer in which the temperature and contours of the ground surface affect the moving air) and of the distribution of water vapor throughout the atmosphere. Significant improvements in the first of these depend, at present, on a better understanding of the science of how air moves under the particularly complicated conditions at the air- land interface: where, in a sense, the rubber meets the road. How much water vapor is in the air and how it is distributed geographically and with height above the surface is another major source of uncertainty in model predictions, because of its dominant role in determining the temperature of the atmosphere. The distribution of water vapor is highly variable, temporally and spatially; improvements in modeling the effects of water vapor await observations more extensive and more accurate than those currently available.(3) Improved representations of the connections that link the atmosphere, the ocean, and the surface of the land. In Nature, each of these affects--and is affected by--the other two. In most of today's models, the real connections that link them together are approximated by arbitrary adjustments or are characterized by large uncertainties. Were we able to include more-accurate representations of these processes, we could use climate models to explore the causes and characteristics of natural climate variability on all time scales. The focus of GCMs was initially on atmospheric processes. Corresponding improvements in the representation of the land surface and the connections between the ocean and the atmosphere are likely to result in substantial model improvements.(4) More explicit representation of the land surface, including vegetation, soil characteristics, and effects of enhanced levels of carbon dioxide and ozone on plants. Modeled estimates of soil moisture, summertime continental drying, and regional climate change depend very much on how accurately the land surface is represented, including more explicit treatment of vegetation of all kinds. All of the known processes that link the atmosphere with the biosphere, or the atmosphere with the soil, are interactive or two- way connections, in the sense that each controls, to a degree, the other.(5) Continued comparisons of models with observational data and with other models. Important new data sets--for example, new, long-term, consistent observations from NASA's Earth Observing System and supplementary data sets now being developed that span the current century--can provide more critical tests of the accuracy of climate models. Progress in model development and improvement can be accelerated by comparisons of this kind, and through the continued intercomparison of the results of different models.(6) Demonstrated capability of climate models to simulate global changes of the past. The ability of a model to predict the climate of the future can be measured by its success in simulating what is known to have happened in the past. Data that describe significant global changes of the past-- including the coming and going of the major ice ages and the climate changes of the last 1000 years--have been obtained through the analysis of tree-rings and the sediments deposited in dated ice and in lake and ocean cores. They provide an invaluable test of the reliability of climate models. Greater emphasis on the analysis of past climates can help assess model projections of climate sensitivity and variability, and lead to enhanced model credibility.(7) Improved representation of the interactions that link climate and vegetation with the concentration of greenhouse gases, and of the effects of aerosols on climate. Temperature, wind, and rainfall are involved in the ongoing exchange of chemical elements and compounds among the air and the water and the solid earth, thus affecting the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Changes in vegetation also affect the continual exchange of chemical elements among air and water and land, and the distribution of water. Aerosols, through their indirect influence on clouds and atmospheric chemistry, can also influence climate.ConclusionsThree major conclusions can be drawn from this three-part examination of the capabilities and limitations of climate models. The first is that we know very well how greenhouse gases affect the energy balance of the Earth, and with similar confidence that the concentrations of these gases are now increasing due to human activities, and that these increases should result in global warming. At issue is not whether the Earth will warm, but by how much, where, when, and with what consequences for society and ecosystems.Second, the level of confidence in the results from present climate models depends very much on the spatial and temporal specificity of the prediction. The most certain are those that pertain to the Earth as a whole and that apply to a roughly fifty-year period. Regional predictions, predictions on a decade-by-decade basis, and predictions of higher-resolution phenomena such as hurricanes, are considerably less certain. For the decisions that we face as individuals, it would be much better were it otherwise, although a highly confident, general prediction with expectations of improved detail can provide a useful guide for broad policy decisions.Third, substantial opportunities now exist, given consistent and long- term research endeavors, to improve the specificity of climate-model predictions. These include efforts to refine spatial resolution, to improve the physical representation of the lowest layer of the atmosphere, to provide more realistic representation of non- atmospheric components of the climate system, and to provide more critical tests of models, both among themselves and against new and more comprehensive observations of present climate and also data from the past.Interestingly, the current focus on the policy relevance of climate models in the U.S. has often been negative: a view that climate models are far too uncertain to be used in setting costly economic or national security policy. The widely-publicized scientific debate over these uncertainties has resulted in considerable confusion, even in cases where the conclusions from climate models are robust. For policy decisions, it would seem far more helpful to understand the degree of certainty or uncertainty associated with the different elements that enter climate predictions.Accurate near- and long-term climate forecasts carry the potential of tremendous economic and humanitarian value. An example of the potential value of advanced prediction is the recent successful use of coupled ocean- atmosphere models for El Nino forecasts to limit the impact of these shorter-term changes in climate on food production and fisheries. The prediction of long-term climate change using GCMs is more challenging than an El Nino forecast, although improvements in the former are likely to be of even greater economic value. Indeed, the importance of advance knowledge may well be the reason that Japan and many countries in Europe are developing strong environmental observation and prediction efforts regarding impending climate change. The improvements in models, outlined above, can be viewed as a path toward more accurate climate predictions. In some cases, these predictions may serve as warnings in areas of societal vulnerabilities, such as food production or the adequacy of freshwater. In many cases, they will clearly contribute to economic vitality.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://sedac.ciesin.org/mva/iamcc.tg/articles/DC1994/DC1994.html <TEXT>ABSTRACTThe prospect of climate change confronts policy makers with difficult choices. The climate change issue is enormously complex, and involves significant physical, social, and political interactions, large uncertainties, potentially serious environmental effects, and significant costs of management. Yet, policy makers must somehow cope with this complex array of issues and uncertainties to make policy decisions today. Unfortunately, two extreme views have emerged, one arguing that society should do nothing until the key uncertainties have been resolved, the other that it should do everything possible to avoid the potential catastrophic outcomes. Policy makers must move beyond these two views to make wise and informed choices from a wide array of alternatives.The Policy Evaluation Framework (PEF) is a decision analysis tool that enables decision makers to continuously formulate policies that take into account the existing uncertainties, and to refine policies as new scientific information is developed.

S. Environmental Protection Agency and Decision Focus Incorporated developed the Global Climate Policy Evaluation Framework to provide decision makers with a tool to evaluate policy alternatives associated with global climate change, while explicitly recognizing and addressing the existence of considerable uncertainty and scientific debate surrounding climate issues. PEF is an integrated assessment tool that allows policy makers to consolidate information from multiple disciplines into a single framework. It has particular strengths that allow decision makers to address immediate policy issues, including investments in mitigation and anticipatory adaptation1 options, the timing of policy actions, the implications of climate change for ecological and economic systems, and the question of insuring against uncertain but potentially significant future damages.    PEF is designed to help investigate and answer questions such as:    * When should society act? What are the benefits of keeping options open?    * What are the interactions between mitigation and adaptation policies?    * Are additional actions justifiable as insurance against uncertain future climate changes?    * What are the policy implications of thresholds or irreversibilities in ecosystems or the economy?    * What are the top priorities for future research?By addressing the uncertainties in physical, biological, and economic systems explicitly, PEF allows policy makers to move beyond the polarized debate in which some argue that society should delay action until the many scientific uncertainties have been resolved, while others argue that the potential outcomes are so catastrophic that society should do everything possible to mitigate climate change. PEF is an integrated model that combines mitigation, adaptation, emissions, climate, economic sectors, and ecosystem effects into a single framework. It is flexible enough to represent virtually any combination of policy options, scenarios, assumptions, and specifications of key relationships. It is efficient enough to evaluate numerous combinations of policy options and scenarios. Both its relationships and its capabilities will continue to evolve as new information becomes available, and new needs arise.PEF's structure combines two components: (1) a deterministic model that describes the physical, biological, and economic impacts of greenhouse gas emissions; and (2) a decision tree system that organizes relevant information about the decisions and uncertainties. These components support the analytical tools that make it possible to evaluate policy alternatives under uncertainty. Figure 1 shows the relationship between PEF's deterministic model and its decision tree. For a given set of assumptions, a specific physical and economic scenario, and a particular policy decision, the deterministic model calculates the resulting physical and economic impacts. The decision tree executes the deterministic model multiple times to evaluate the effect of various uncertainties and decisions.    The PEF framework may be divided into three levels:    * 1) the overall structure as a decision analysis tool with a decision tree and a deterministic model;    * 2) The specific equations used in the deterministic model in an application of the framework;    * 3) The numerical assumptions used as inputs in any specific set of analyses.Both the deterministic model and the decision tree were designed with considerable flexibility to address a wide range of scenarios, options, and levels of detail, and to easily update relationships and assumptions in light of new information. The equations comprising the deterministic model are likely to evolve periodically as further research becomes available. The specific numerical assumptions can be changed readily to enable any set of assumptions and scenarios to be studied.The scope of the framework includes both economic and ecosystem impacts, and both near-term and long-term adaptation and mitigation decisions. The near-term decisions are the primary focus of the model; the long-term decisions are included to provide a more realistic model of the consequences of near-term decisions, and to investigate the implications of the timing of actions.DETERMINISTIC MODELPEF's deterministic model calculates the impacts of climate change given a set of policy alternatives and a single scenario for each input parameter. PEF provides the ability to disaggregate impacts by geographic region, economic sector and ecosystem type. The calculations within the deterministic model are divided into a series of modules:    * U. S. emissions    * Rest-of-world emissions    * Atmospheric processes and global climate    * Regional climate    * Economic impacts    * Ecosystem impacts.Figure 2 illustrates the deterministic model's structure.Designing the deterministic model required tradeoffs between the detail of physical and economic representations and the simplicity needed for a practical analytical tool that can be used to rapidly evaluate an array of policy options and scenarios. This type of structure provides transparency, which also helps policy makers understand and interpret the results. For most processes, the model represents the physical relationships with parametric equations that can be calibrated to the results of larger, more detailed models. This approach provides the flexibility to represent many differing assumptions, opinions, or results. As PEF evolves, various relationships in the deterministic model will be updated to reflect new information.The deterministic model uses reduced form models where it is appropriate to do so--that is, where the key aspects of the underlying phenomena are relatively well understood. The atmospheric process and global climate relationships, for example, use this approach. Where there is not yet a good understanding of the underlying processes, or where it is not reasonable to represent these processes with a reduced form model, the deterministic model uses structured functional forms. The economic impacts and ecosystem impacts relationships, for example, use this approach. All modules include enough parametric flexibility to represent, or to bound, any reasonable scenario. This capability allows sensitivity analyses to help prioritize refinements of the model. Each module is described below.Mitigation and Adaptation DecisionsThe current version of PEF includes first- and second-period mitigation and adaptation decisions. The model considers all combinations of alternatives. For example, selecting a first period mitigation alternative does not limit the range of first-period adaptation alternatives available, nor does it limit the range of second-period mitigation or adaptation alternatives available. Each period's decision may include up to six different mitigation and six adaptation alternatives.An individual mitigation alternative includes the target reductions in U. S. and rest-of-world emissions over time for each greenhouse gas. The realized reductions, as a percentage of the target reductions, are specified separately for U. S. and rest-of-world emissions. Each alternative may also include the cost of the alternative, or the cost can be estimated using an endogenous model in PEF. Although PEF can estimate reductions in any greenhouse gas, the cost model currently estimates only the cost of carbon dioxide reductions. If an alternative scenario includes reductions in other gases, the cost of those reductions must be specified. This structure makes it possible to incorporate the cost and efficacy of mitigation from other models or studies.A particular adaptation alternative includes four components: the dollar investment in economic adaptation by sector over time; the dollar investment in protecting ecosystems (ecosystem adaptation) by ecosystem type over time; the allocation of each sector's economic adaptation investment across the regions; and the allocation of each ecosystem type's adaptation investment across the regions. Adaptation alternatives may differ both in amount and timing of spending. In PEF, the cumulative investment, less depreciation, can reduce the impact of climate change on the economy and on ecosystems. The spending is expressed in annual rates of spending in billions of constant dollars. The parameters that describe the effect of adaptation on the impacts and the rate at which the adaptation investment depreciates are specified separately.U. S. and Rest-of-world EmissionsAlthough they are distinct modules, the U. S. and rest-of-world emission modules are described together because their structures are identical. PEF can treat U. S. and rest-of-world emissions separately, or it can treat them together by including the U.S. emissions with the rest-of-world.Given a particular mitigation alternative, with its associated emissions reductions, the emission modules estimate the annual emissions from U. S. and rest-of-world sources of each gas. Emissions are built up from the baseline emissions scenario, the target reduction due to mitigation, and a parameter representing the efficacy of mitigation.PEF provides several alternatives in selecting the gases to include in an analysis. The model includes specialized atmospheric process relationships for carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Carbon dioxide can be modeled alone or with these other gases. Beyond these, PEF can include any other gases as well, such as CFCs or HCFCs, that fit into the standard relationships described below. The mitigation alternatives may address any of these gases.Atmospheric Processes and Global ClimateThe atmospheric processes and global climate module calculates the changes in global average temperature and average sea level from the emissions of greenhouse gases. As Figure 3 shows, he module calculates several intermediate steps between emissions and temperature and sea level changes. In the most detailed analyses, the concentrations, equilibrium and realized temperatures, and sea level can be reported at each time increment.The module uses the Maier-Reimer and Hasselmann model, as described by T. M. L. Wigley [3], for future carbon dioxide emissions, while it uses a single-sink decay model for past carbon dioxide emissions and for all emissions of other gases. The module uses the IPCC radiative forcing relationships [4] to calculate radiative forcing directly from the concentrations of greenhouse gases. Following the IPCC [4], it assumes a linear relationship between changes in radiative forcing and the equilibrium temperature. It uses a parametric model to describe the relationship between equilibrium and realized temperature, which treats each increase in equilibrium temperature as a pulse that becomes realized over time. A parametric model, based on STUGE [6], is used to calculate the change in global sea level.Regional ClimatePEF's regional climate model calculates regional changes in temperature, precipitation, and runoff from the changes in global mean temperature. In addition, it provides the global changes in sea level and carbon dioxide concentration as inputs to the impact modules.The choice of regional climate variables is driven by the requirements of the damage functions. The model can be easily expanded to meet the requirements of the economic damage functions and the ecosystem failure relationships (described below) as they evolve.General circulation models still offer little insight into the nature of regional changes in temperature and precipitation, runoff, and soil moisture. PEF therefore provides flexible general relationships for regional changes, so that the sensitivity of analytical results to different assumptions about regional climate effects can be explored. The existing structure includes separate variables for each of the regional climate indicators to allow analyses of the influence of an individual indicator and the value of resolving its uncertainty.Economic ImpactsThis module calculates the monetary impact of climate change and the cost of policy actions from the adaptation and mitigation policies and from the regional climate indicators. The module calculates impacts by sector in each region, using up to fifteen sectors in up to ten regions, accounts for adaptation, and estimates the annual damages.Economic impacts are those that would typically appear in GDP calculations or other monetized economic measures. In general, the economic impacts include effects on activities that take place within economic markets, or on goods that are exchanged on economic markets. The model also places a monetary value on the ecosystem impacts, wherever possible. These generally are effects that are not manifested in markets.PEF allows spending on both ecosystem and economic adaptation to influence the economic impacts. Spending is accumulated into a stock of investment, which depreciates at a rate determined by an input variable. Adaptation spending targeted at ecosystems are also allowed to affect the economic sector through cross-effect parameters. The cross effects of ecosystem adaptation may increase or decrease the economic impacts. The savings due to economic adaptation are a function of both the adjusted stock of adaptation investment and the impacts before adaptation. Both the depreciation rates and the efficacy of adaptation may vary across sectors.PEF assumes that the total impacts to a sector can be estimated by adding the impacts due to temperature change, precipitation change, and the other climate indicators. It could, however, be modified to include interaction terms between climate indicators. Damages may be estimated using any combination of linear functions, power functions of arbitrary power, logistic functions, and step functions. PEF uses a separate set of parameters for each combination of sector, region, and climate indicator.The model does not address reactive adaptation explicitly. Instead, the damages in each sector are meant to represent the impacts of climate change, net of the impacts of reactive adaptation. Anticipatory adaptation may reduce damages either by reducing the sensitivity of an economic sector to climate change or by reducing the need for reactive adaptation with more effective anticipatory adaptation.Ecosystem ImpactsVery few models exist to guide the initial development of the ecosystem impact module. As a result, PEF uses a simple model which is divided into three processes: estimating the fractional loss of each type of ecosystem by region; estimating the value per unit area lost by region and ecosystem type; and calculating the annual (monetized) impact by region and ecosystem type.In estimating the fractional loss of ecosystems, the model assumes that changes in climate make some fraction of the ecosystem valueless. This could represent total failure of some fraction of land that had been populated by a particular type of ecosystem, or it could represent a partial loss of all of the land of that ecosystem type within the region.Once the model has estimated a fractional loss, it then uses a valuation function to estimate the value per unit area by type and region. As with the economic impact module, any combination of linear, arbitrary power, logistic, and step functions can be used to estimate the ecosystem damages. This would allow, for example, the value per acre of a particular type in a given region to increase sharply as the ecosystem becomes scarce. Similar to the economic impacts module, adaptation investments may be made to reduce the amount of ecosystem damage. Ecosystem adaptation is modeled in the same way as economic adaptation, with a stock of investment, depreciation, efficacy of adaptation, and cross effects from economic sector investments.In the final step, the model combines the area lost, the valuation per acre, and the level of economic and ecosystem adaptation into an annual impact, measured in dollars, of ecosystem or nonmonetary damages. This version of the model, while crude, can perform "what-ifs" analyses regarding non-market impacts to provide useful policy insights. Despite its simplistic nature, this model represents an improvement over those that ignore the potential non-market impacts of climate change.Time StructureThe time horizon for an analysis, which is specified by the analyst, determines the beginning and end of the period for which impacts are calculated. Within this horizon, PEF's current structure contains two points at which decisions are made. The first set of decisions occurs at the beginning of the time horizon, while the second set may occur at any point within the time horizon. The beginning of each time period, the time step between calculations, and the end of the horizon are user-specified.Relating this to the levels described in the overview, the use of two decision periods is part of level two and is embedded in PEF's relationships. As such, it could be changed, but not on a regular basis. The beginning and end of the horizon, and the length of the time step, are part of level three and thus can be changed from run to run. Table 1 describes the specific timing assumptions embedded in the current version of PEF.DECISION TREE AND ANALYSIS CAPABILITIESWhile the core mathematical relationships representing physical and economic processes are located in the deterministic model, linking the deterministic model with a decision tree enables a wide variety of analyses to be carried out. Policy evaluation can be thought of as two interrelated processes: comparing different alternate actions based on cost, effectiveness, impacts, etc., and determining the effect of important uncertainties on physical and economic impacts and on the choice of preferred policies. The decision tree facilitates both processes by selecting and executing appropriate runs of the deterministic model, compiling the results, and presenting the information concisely.PEF provides a range of built-in analyses, which can be subdivided into deterministic and probabilistic analyses. Deterministic analyses investigate the preferred policy options under various climate and impact scenarios. Probabilistic analyses use the likelihoods of different outcomes to evaluate appropriate options under conditions of uncertainty. Concise descriptions of each of the analysis types are provided in Table 2.ILLUSTRATIVE RESULTSThis section describes some illustrative results derived using PEF, based on a set of assumptions that treats the U. S. in aggregate, with a single geographic region, economic sector and ecosystem type. While disaggregated analyses are underway, these preliminary analyses illustrate some insights that PEF can provide. More detailed analyses and insights drawn from PEF are described in the EPA's forthcoming Integrated Assessment of Global Climate Change [1].How Do Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies Depend on Uncertainties?The most basic issue that PEF can address is the relationship between uncertainties and the preferred levels of mitigation and adaptation. An interesting question regards how preferred strategies change under various climate scenarios. Figure 4 shows realized temperature paths that results from various combinations of doubling temperature and temperature lag scenarios. (The temperature lag describes the rate at which increases in equilibrium temperature become observable.) Figure 5 shows the preferred long-term mitigation and adaptation strategies under the three doubling temperature scenarios. At this point, the value of the analyses is not primarily in determining a single correct policy to implement, but rather in evaluating the potential effects of uncertainties on appropriate decisions. Uncertainty in the climate scenario, by itself, affects the preferred level of action: as the climate scenario becomes worse (more rapid change), more action is warranted.The preferred alternatives are also strongly sensitive to the impacts scenarios. Figure 6 shows PEF results for appropriate mitigation and adaptation policies under combinations of economic sensitivity scenarios. (The scenarios are defined by the impacts, as a percentage of gross domestic product, that result from a 2. 5 C increase in realized temperature.) Although these results are preliminary, they suggest that uncertainties in the impacts resulting from a given level of climate change may be as important to policy decisions as the uncertainty in the extent of climate change itself.How Do Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies Interact?In addition to investigating the sensitivity of policies to uncertainties, PEF can provide insights into the interaction between policies. The left panel in Figure 7 shows the preferred long-term mitigation, under the best-guess assumption and scenarios, for differing levels of long-term adaptation spending. Similarly, the right panel shows the preferred long-term adaptation level for differing long-term reduction rates. The preferred level of mitigation is sensitive to the preferred level of investment in adaptation, but the preferred level of adaptation is less sensitive to the preferred level of mitigation.Because mitigation and adaptation work through different mechanisms, they interact asymmetrically. Whereas investment in adaptation are directly targeted at the impacts, investments in mitigation reduce impacts indirectly through changes in the climate. Therefore, while potentially more expensive, adaptation could have larger effects on impacts more quickly. Thus, mitigation becomes less cost-effective when high levels of adaptation investment reduce the impacts, while adaptation is still effective in the presence of high levels of mitigation,What are the Implications of Thresholds?Physical, biological, or economic systems may exhibit threshold behavior, experiencing sharp changes in response as driving factors cross thresholds. This could happen, for example, as species become extinct, or as increases in sea level overwhelm coastal defenses. These scenarios are modeled in PEF using a threshold function like the one shown in Figure 8.Figure 9 shows the preferred long-term emission reductions for different threshold scenarios. The results to date suggest that the preferred reduction in emissions is more sensitive to the time at which the threshold occurs than to the magnitude of the impacts.CONCLUSIONSThe Policy Evaluation Framework provides a flexible and powerful tool for policy makers. PEF's design evolved from a set of questions that are at the heart of global climate policy debate. PEF addresses all facets of the climate issue that must be considered to answer these policy questions, using the best available scientific and socioeconomic information. PEF is even flexible enough to address "what if" questions to explore different assumptions about aspects of climate change where limited information exists.PEF has been used to investigate the relationships between the key uncertainties and the available policy alternatives. Nothing hinders the adaptability of the model to new information in science or economics. Further efforts will focus on refining the assumptions and scenarios used, especially in developing sectorally disaggregated impact functions.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://sedac.ciesin.org/mva/iamcc.tg/articles/GE1993/GE1993.html <TEXT>INTRODUCTIONIn the late 1980s, interest nourished in the issue of global climate change. Many studies focused on the options for limiting anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse- related gases and managing the consequences of global warming and climate change. Making appropriate policy choices requires information on both the costs and benefits, as they occur over time, of policy interventions, and an increasing number of studies have sought to quantify the costs especially of limiting CO2 emissions, as the dominant anthropogenic source. Such analyses now form an important part of overall policy assessments and influence international negotiations on policy responses. However, these studies are not well understood. In this paper we seek to analyze the literature on the costs of CO2 abatement.The majority of work in estimating the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions has occurred since 1988, but interest in the issue of costing emissions reductions began more than a decade earlier with the work of Nordhaus (1, 2). Nordhaus's early work focused on the issue of reducing fossil- fuel CO2 emissions, as did that of Edmonds & Reilly (3, 4), Kosobud et al (5), Seidel & Keyes (6), Rose et al (7), Lovins et al (8), Williams et al (9), Manne ( 10), Perry et al (11), Nordhaus & Yohe ( 12), and Mintzer (13), among others. Only Seidel & Keyes, Perry et al, and Mintzer examined non- CO2 emissions, and these studies treated them separately and in an ad hoc manner; none of the studies took land- use change into account explicitly.While not the primary focus of their analysis, some of the studies conducted prior to 1988 analyzed the cost of emissions reductions. The results of these studies foreshadow the current debate. Edmonds & Reilly (14) noted in their 1985 literature assessment:      The economic costs of CO2 abatement policies have only been partially analyzed at this time. Edmonds and Reilly, Kosobud et al, and Nordhaus, each using a different model, indicate that the reduction in aggregate GNP associated with even stringent punitive strategies is not large, usually only a few percentage points. Lovins et al argued that the costs might actually be negative.This assessment explores the subsequent development, deepening, and broadening of these research veins, focusing on the past five years of research on the costs of limiting CO2 emissions. While other gases are relevant (15),2 as invited by Annual Reviews we focus on fossil CO2because this forms the bulk of projected radiative change over the next century, because debates about the economic impact of limiting greenhouse gas emissions have focused on fossil-fuel CO2 as potentially the most expensive, and because data concerning fossil CO2 sources are good and the relevant research base is rich and deep. We recognize the potential role of forests as a "sink" for CO2 emissions as a significant but currently separate issue which is beyond the scope of this paper.The purpose of this paper is fourfold. First, we seek to give a broad and accessible guide to the main studies reported over the past five years.3 Second, we seek to clarify the issues involved in estimating abatement costs through a systematic study and classification of the relevant concepts. Third, through critical analysis of reported results, we suggest ranges of plausible estimates. Finally, we highlight the most important areas of uncertainty or confusion and suggest areas on which future research needs to concentrate.To this end, we start (Section 2) by noting differing uses of the term "costs" and the way in which scope and definition of analysis affects results.2Note that the list of relevant emitted gases differs importantly from the list of greenhouse gases. The list of relevant greenhouse gases, that is, those gases that are effectively transparent to incoming sunlight but that absorb in the infrared spectrum, includes CO2, CH4, N2O, O3, H2O, CFCs, and CFC substitutes. Greenhouse- related emitted gases are linked to greenhouse gases through natural processes such as atmospheric chemistry and albedo.1In finalizing this review, we have sought to reference the most accessible, relevant, and general sources, rather than obscure or superseded ones. In particular, the series of papers by Cline, and by Manne &Richels, have each been brought together in books; various studies for the European Commission have been brought together in a two- volume edition of the European Economy; and many of the reports by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Economics Department have been reproduced in a special issue of OECD Economic Studies. All these volumes were published during 1992, and to the extent possible we reference the books rather than the many separate research papers.We clarify the way in which we use the term in this paper so that results are to the extent possible comparable.Sections 3 and 4 then review abatement cost estimates. Section 3 summarizes estimates derived directly from studies of the technologies available for limiting emissions, and ways of interpreting them. Section 4 summarizes the results of studies that have sought to model the impact of CO2 abatement on whole energy systems.Sections 5 and 6 then explore the modeling and assumption differences that affect cost estimates. Section 5 explains and classifies the different kinds of models that have been applied, and Section 6 reviews the impact of variations in key numerical parameters. Sections 2-6 draw heavily on the review of literature performed for Phase I of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Greenhouse Gas Abatement Costing Studies (16).The paper then draws together the material in sections 2-6, to examine critically the nature and relative importance of these various sources of cost difference, and the implications that follow from this. Section 7 analyzes the economic and engineering perspectives, the differences between which are a major source of cost differences; the discussion includes the role of energy-efficiency and of low-carbon supply technologies, as well as resolution of these perspectives. Section 8 then examines issues relating to the strategy of abatement and scope of analysis. Finally, Section 9 draws general conclusions from the study, and suggests some implications for future research.MODELING AND COSTING DEFINITIONS AND PARADIGMSThe cost of emissions reductions is always computed as a difference in a given measure of performance between a reference scenario and a scenario that involves lower emissions. By far the most commonly used measures of performance are the net direct financial costs to the energy sector assessed at a specified discount rate; and the estimated impact on gross national product (GNP), or its close cousin GDP. GNP is the monetary value of new final goods and services produced in a given year, and it provides a measure of the scale of human activities that pass through markets, plus imputed values of some nonmarket activities. It is generally assumed that financial costs in the energy sector can be closely related to impacts on GNP, though as noted below this is not always the case.Neither direct financial costs nor GNP provide direct measures of human welfare. One factor is that human welfare does not necessarily increase linearly with the degree of consumption; a given loss of income will likely matter far more to poor people, or poor countries, than to richer ones, for example. Some studies attempt to capture this through "equivalent welfare" measures, but these still rely centrally on a marketed-products basis. A broader limitation is revealed by the fact that there are many examples where GNP moves in the opposite direction to human well-being. For example, a disease that increases the sale of medicine may boost GNP but make individuals worse off; environmental disasters can stimulate economic activity, but the environment (and human enjoyment of it) is diminished.This reflects the fact that GNP does not incorporate many nonmarket factors that affect welfare. Some studies have sought to examine explicitly the impact of abatement on various external costs, and concluded that these can be very significant (Section 8.4). However, in general, studies focus on financial costs or GNP impact. In the broader literature, other welfare indices have been attempted (such as the United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) Human Development Index), but data are rarely adequate to quantify impacts in such terms in abatement-costing studies. At present, for quantifying results there is little practical alternative to working with monetary cost and GNP impacts, but the caveats about these as measures of welfare impacts need to be borne in mind.Nor is GNP necessarily a good measure of consumption. For example, some forms of carbon taxation can move resources from consumption to investment, which can boost GNP but for many years may lower consumption. It is unclear whether welfare has improved or declined. Alternatively, tax revenues might be returned to households, which could raise household consumption but depress long-term GNP.This also raises the issue of comparing costs in different periods. Results concerning abatement costs are sensitive to the assumed discount rate. This is particularly important with respect to evaluating the importance of the potential impacts from climate change, where the appropriate discount rate is both crucially important (because of the long timescales) and very uncertain (because of the timescales and because it is an attempt to make an explicit valuation of long-term public welfare); for a discussion see Cline (17). For assessing abatement costs, the timescales are less and the discount rate has to be related to the actual rates revealed or set by government for the sector in which the abatement investments are being made, so this is a less central (though still significant) issue. In this study we simply report results as estimated by the studies concerned, given the discount rates they assume (which, for the major energy investments considered in this study, are typically about 5-8% real discount rate).Almost since the beginning of costing studies, a clear division has existed between those that fundamentally use an economic approach, which relies on observed market behavior and which generally assume that markets operate equally efficiently in the reference and abatement case; and those that use a technology-engineering approach, which emphasizes a technically optimal abatement scenario (which may be contrasted with a reference case that is by implication not optimal). The choice of "cost paradigm" in this sense is a fundamental determinant of results--including often the sign of abatement costs--and these differences form an important theme of this paper.Economic studies use "top-down" models, which analyze aggregated behavior based on economic indices of prices and elasticities, and focus implicitly or explicitly on the use of carbon taxes to limit emissions. These studies have mostly concluded that relatively large carbon taxes (e.g. that could much more than double the minemouth cost of coal) would be required to achieve goals such as the stabilization of fossil-fuel carbon emissions .Technology-oriented studies use "bottom-up" engineering models, which focus on the integration of technology cost and performance data. Many such studies have concluded conversely that emission reductions could be achieved with net cost savings.The division between the "economic paradigm" and the "engineering paradigm" is closely related--but not identical--to the division between "top-down" and "bottom-up" models, as it has emerged in the literature. These differences, as a major source of differing estimates, form a strong theme in this paper: the formal modeling differences are clarified in Section 5.1, and the underlying "paradigmatic" issues are explored in Section 7.There are also many modeling differences within each category. Most notably, since 1990 an important general division has become evident between the application of top-down models that have been developed for long-run "equilibrium" analysis of energy and abatement costs (reflecting an idealized economy with optimal allocation of resources), and conventional macro- economic models designed for shorter-run analysis of the dynamic responses of economies (which reflect many existing imperfections). Longrun equilibrium models generally estimate the costs of reducing emissions to be positive and high by the standards of most environmental measures implemented to date. Macro-economic models indicate a far more complex pattern of responses and cost indicators, which may move in different directions and vary over time. The distinctions are explored further in Section 5.2.Rather than initiate our survey with a detailed analysis of models, however, we start by summarizing the results that have been presented, with a review and interpretation of technology cost curves (Section 3) and then a summary of general results from system modeling studies (Section 4).ABATEMENT TECHNOLOGIES AND TECHNOLOGY COST CURVESTechnology Cost-Curve ResultsClearly a major determinant of CO2 abatement costs will be the costs and adequacy of technologies that can reduce emissions. Many studies of the technologies that could help to limit greenhouse gas emissions have been conducted; major reviews are given in IPCC (18), Fulkerson et al (19), IEA/OECD (20), Grubb (21), and Goldemberg et al (22). In addition, many international databases with information on energy technologies have now been established; the UNEP study (16, Appendix I) lists no less than 13 technology databases now available.Technology cost curves provide a useful way of summarizing the technical potential for limiting emissions as identified in such studies. The simplest approach is to stack up different technologies in order of the cost of emission reductions or energy displaced, though cost curves can be used to represent the output for almost any degree of sophistication in modeling. There are various ways of generating cost curves of successively greater sophistication and consistency, as discussed in UNEP (16).Discrete technology cost curves for various developed countries are presented by Lovins & Lovins (23), Mills et al (24), Jackson (25), and Krause et al (26). An EPRI (27) study examined potential savings in the US electricity sector and concluded that "if by the year 2000 the entire stock of electrical end-use stock were to be replaced with the most efficient end-use technologies (nearly all of them estimated to be cheaper than equivalent supply), the maximum savings could range from 24% to 44% of electricity supply." Lovins & Lovins (23, 27) suggest much higher potential savings still. The cost curves associated with these two analyses are shown in Figure 1, which demonstrates that a good database does not necessarily ensure comparable results; the potential estimated by EPRI (the upper curve) is clearly very much smaller than that estimated by Lovins (the lower curve). Compared against typical US electricity prices of at least 6-7 cents per kWh, however, both illustrate that substantial emission reductions appear to be available at net cost savings.Technology cost curves have by no means been confined to developed countries. A number are presented in studies of the Asian Energy Institute network summarized in (16); Figure 2 shows a discrete technology cost curve estimated for CO2 savings available by 2000 in Brazil. Figure 3 shows a continuous version of a technology cost curve for Poland.A consistent set of national abatement cost curves, derived by aggregating technology studies, is presented by COHERENCE for the Commission of the European Communities (29). Figure 4 summarizes the results, which indicate considerabic variation between counilics and highlight the dependence on the baseline projections; the technologies identified offer stabilization of emissions relative to a base year (19RS) at little or no cost for the northern European countries, in which basclinc emissions growth is expected to be slow, but at much greater cost for the southern European countries, which expect rapid growth in baseline emissions.Finally we note that the scope and basis of cost curves can vary greatly. The Tata Energy Research Institute has developed a detailed appraisal that for India focusses on investment requirements, rather than net cost/savings. Most curves have been confined to the energy sector. or parts thereof, but others (such as the Indian study) include reforestation and some addresse other gases as well. Nordhaus (30) presents an approximate composite curve that seeks to include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as well in a global greenhouse-gas abatement curve. The Nordhaus analysis also reinforces the fact that cost curves are a way of presenting data, not of generating results; it seeks to summarize a wide range of results from economic models, and has no "negative cost" section.Limitations and InterpretationAbatement cost curves reflect the weaknesses and strengths of the procedures used to produce them. The simplest technology curves usefully summarize technical data, but may have substantial limitations as guides to actual abatement costs. In part this is because, unless they are developed iteratively using quite sophisticated system models, they may neglect interactions among abatement options and thus "double count" some emissions savings--the CO2 savings from reducing electricity demand may for example be much reduced if nonfossil sources are introduced later to displace coal power generation. They may also neglect interactions between various end-uses, for example that between heat and lighting in widely diverse building enviromnents. Frequently also they do not reflect adequately the timescales involved in bringing the technologies into place and the underlying growth in demand that may occur in the interim.Even after such issues are carefully incorporated, technology assessments and cost curves (particularly for end-use technologies) still demonstrate a large potential for emission savings apparently at "negative cost"--technologies that would both reduce emissions and yield net financial savings. Typically, these suggest a potential to reduce emissions by well over 20% at net cost savings. the uncertainties, however, are very large, and, to be meaningful, numbers have to be defined very carefully in terms of scope and timescale. Based on an extensive review of technologies and related cost-curve studies, Grubb (21, Chapter 2) concludes that "substituting identified and cost-effective technologies in OECD countries could in principic increase the efficiency of electricity use by up to 50%, and of other applications by 15-40%, over the next two decades. Fully optimizing energy systems would yield larger savings, but it is far from clear how much of this potential can be tapped."Thus, technology studies and cost curves show that a large "energy-efficiency gap" exists between the apparent technical potential for cost-effective improvements, and what is currently taken up in energy markets. In well-functioning markets, cost-effective options should be exploited anyway, since someone should profit by doing so. Some of the cost-effective potential may be taken up over time. But if such technologies are not being exploited, this may indicate that other important factors are not captured in technology analysis. For example, there may be hidden costs, or people may be unaware of the options, or there may be other obstacles to uptake. The acceptability of different options may also vary, for least cost is by no means the only criterion that matters to people. This illustrates the fact that the apparent technical potential in fact comprises a number of different components. As illustrated in Figure 5, realizable gains consist of:1. those that are economically attractive in their own right and that will be installed without policy changes;2. those that would not be obtained unless institutional constraints and barriers are removed, and/or other micro-economic policies are implemented to increase the take-up of cost-effective options;3. those that are justified on the basis of non-greenhouse external benefits (e.g. reduced other environmental impacts, increased energy security).In addition, some apparently cost-effective savings cannot be realized. The real economic potential differs from apparent potential due to:1. "take back" or ''rebound'' Or savings (improved) efficiency reduces the cost of the associated energy service and therefore stimulates increased demand for the energy service);2. unavoidable hidden costs (there may be costs associated with the use of a technology or policies to stimulate its uptake that are not revealed in a simplified analysis);3. consumer preference (the technologies may not be a perfect substitute in the provision of the energy service, which may either increase or decrease consumer readiness to take up more efficient technologies, depending on their characteristics). For example, it would be technically possible and highly "cost-effective" to mandate a doubling of car efficiency in most countries; but it would probably make the vehicles available smaller and less powerful, which people may consider unacceptable (often this can also be considered as an aspect of hidden costs).These different components need to be understood before drawing conclusions about the scope for "cost-free" reductions. We underline that such cost curves identify a technical potential but there is no expectation that all of this can be realized. Part of the key is to consider specific policies for introducing hotter technologies. set against explicit baseline scenarios that incorporate some "business as usual" uptake. Johansson et al (31) present a cost curve (described partly in terms of particular policy changes to introduce more efficient energy technologies in the United States, drawing in part on much more detailed implementation studies. Drawing on such studies, estimates of the practical potential based on such cost curves are discussed in Section 7.3 below.To conclude, cost curves can be extremely useful and flexible ways of displaying data, and those that summarize technical potentials consistently indicate a large potential for technologies that can reduce CO2 emissions with net cost reductions. But they can only reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the models used to generate the data, and the extent to which these models reflect interdependencies, hidden costs, and issues of implementation and timescales. What matters is not the cost curve itself, but the underlying methods and models used to produce results. In this context, modeling studies that seek to encompass whole systems and economies have attracted particular attention, and it is to these that we now turn.A REVIEW OF SYSTEM-WIDE ABATEMENT COST ESTIMATESA wide variety of abatement costing studies at the global and national levels have been carried out. !4 In this section, we summarize the results from cost studies first at the global level, and then from various national cost estimates across a range of modeling methods and countries, focusing first on the extensive range of US studies, then other OECD studies, and finally studies of non-OECD regions. The subsequent sections examine the reasons for differing cost results.Global StudiesIn this section we summarize results from six major models used to estimate the global costs of limiting CO2 emissions, listed in Table 1. As summarized immediately below (modeling terms and classification are discussed in Section 5), four of these use fundamentally different global energy/ economic models, one uses an economic growth modeling framework oriented towards technology development, and one is a global bottom-up study. Other global models have been developed, notably the models of Rutherford (CRTM) and Peck & Teisberg (CETA). the IEA (32), McKibben & Wilcoxen (33), and the ICF "global macro-energy model" used as part of the "atmospheric stabilization framework (ASF)" for US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) studies (34). These and others (35) are not included here because they are either based on models already covered or do not generate results in a relevant comparabic form.5The six major global models/studies reviewed here are:1. Whalley & Wigle (36, 37) use a comparative static, economic general equilibrium model, incorporating trade but with only two fuel types (carbon and noncarbon) and no representation or backstop or other technologies. Their analysis focused on trade and the implications of different ways of applying taxes and distributing emission constraints.2. The Global 2100 model of Manne & Richels (38-40) is a top-down general equilibrium model with a small selection of supply-side energy technologies, including carbon-free "backstop" technologies, which are available in unlimited quantities when the price becomes high enough. The model is fully optimizing within each of five regions, but there is limited trade between regions, so the result is not a global least-cost abatement. (The constraints used involved relatively high losses for the Soviet Union and China in particular.) Derivatives of this model include Rutherford's Carbon Rights Trade Model (CRTM) (41), which relaxes the no-trade constraint, and the Carbon Emissions Trajectory Assessment (CETA) (42), which aggregates the regions and incorporates a climate damage function.3. The Edmunds-Reilly-Barns model (ERB) (3, 4) is an energy-greenhouse gas simulation model with detailed representation of energy supply technologies, including cost curves, with energy trade between each of nine regions. The model has been widely distributed and used by different authors. The model contains a highly simplified macro-economic linkage intended to reflect feedback effects, not for GNP evaluation; emissions reduction costs are much better inferred from the incremental costs incurred, which is the measure reported in this paper (see Section 5.3).4. The OECD's GREEN model (43, 44) is a 12-region general equilibrium model, which in its more recent versions is a multiperiod model with capital stock modeling that encompasses both trade and backstop technologies5. Anderson & Bird (45) employ a simple economic growth model to illustrate bounds on the economic impact of abatement strategies that are based on expansion of renewable energy. The key feature of their analysis is inclusion of a relationship between investment and cost reduction in alternative supply technologies.6. The Goldemberg et al (46) study Energy for a Sustainable World is the only bottom-up global study. While not an abatement costing study as such, its detailed disaggregation of global energy use and available technologies concludes that global energy demand could increase by only 10% from current levels by the year 2020 through full exploitation of cost-effective technologies for improving energy-efficiency.In Figure 6a we summarize the major published results from these modeling studies, plotting the degree of abatement against the cost measured directly (for energy sector models) or as GNPloss, relative to the projected GNP. Figure 6a shows the results in terms of reductions from the baseline projection generated by the model; simple calculation shows that the average rate of abtement in almost all these studies, despite their apparent diversity, is 1.3-2.0% per year below the baseline projection. Figure 6b illustrates the same results, but in terms of the level relative to the base year (usually 1990). Contrasting the two curves shows that emission changes from a base year show less of a pattern, due primarily to the wide variation in the baseline emission projections, discussed in Sections 6 and 7.2. Because of such variation, in this study we concentrate primarily on reductions relative to the reference projection without CO2 constraints (the baseline). Thus, in the presentation of results from studies we seek to abstract from the scale of the economy by normalizing results to both the reference GNP and the reference fossil-fuel CO2 emission-trajectory. To the extent that system scale is sharply a linear multiplier of results, this makes results comparable relative to the baseline. The essential linearity of costs with scale has been shown to characterize thc ERB model (81). The scale (e.g. of baseline emissions growth), however, has powerful implications for the ease or diffictilty of achieving a specific target emission reduction.Additional information on these global studies is provided by Figure 7, which shows the relationship between the relative CO2 reduction and required "carbon tax" (marginal abatement cost as reported by the model in the target year), and by Figure 7b, which shows the relationship between the reported carbon tax and the average GNP loss in the target year. Interestingly, whereas for a fixed analysis the marginal cost must always be greater than the average cost, this plot shows no such relationship. For some models this may reflect anomalies in the way that marginal cost impacts are translated into GNP impacts (see Section 5.3); another source of such behavior is that in some models the CO2 constraints are introduced so as to impose a much higher marginal cost over the first few decades than in the very long run (see Section 8.3). All these global studies impose a fixed path of emission constraint; only the simpler CETA(42) and DICE (35) models optimize the path of abatement to reach a given concentration level.Because of such anomalies, there is no uniquely preferable single measure for cost comparisons. We have to draw on the models and results as generated to date, and for all subsequent analysis in this paper we choose the target date GNP loss (or total additional energy sector cost) relative to projected baseline GNP as the most appropriate single cost indicator.Even when normalized relative to the differing baseline projections, however, the results still show great variation. The Whalley-Wigle results define the high end of the cost spectrum. The relatively high costs probably reflect the limitations imposed by only having one generic carbon fuel, the lack of technology representation, and an extraordinarily high baseline projection, which scales up the global energy system 10-fold over the century, because there is no allowance for autonomous efficiency improvements (see Sections 6 and 7).6 The Goldembarg et al bottom-up results define a lower bound, with emissions reductions perhaps up to 50% estimated at no cost.7 However, some of the sensitivity runs of the global top-down models, when given more optimistic estimates of energy-efficiency improvements and supply technology development, can also produce very low costs (e.g. see discussions in Section 6).Not including the Whalley-Wigle outlier for the reasons above, the resulting spread of results roughly indicate that the costs of a long-run 50% reduction in global CO2 emissions could range from negligible to a loss of about 3% in global GNP. Reductions of 80-90% degrees GNP by 2-6%; at the other end of the curve, the global economic models (as well as the engineering models) suggest that emission reductions of at least 10-15% can he obtained at very low cost.These global models are highly aggregated and capture technical issues, macro-economic issues, regional differences, and trade effects with varying degrees of detail. They inevitably sacrifice local and technological detail in order to represent important regional differences and (in some) incorporate trade. To start to narrow down the range requires a fuller examination, which we present below, of the factors affecting model results.Abatement Costing Studies for the United StatesA wide range of national studies has been carried out: of these. the US ones have received the most attention. Table 2 and Figure 8 show the range of estimates of the impact on GNP of CO2 emissions reductions relative to the projected baseline emissions.The survey of US studies shows predominantly top-down economic studies. Many bottom-up/engineering studies have also been carried out, but most have been confined to cost-curve or subsectoral studies. In addition to the earlier examples cited in Section 3, important recent studies include those of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) (47), and the Office of Technology Assessment or the US Congress (OTA) (48).8 These. like most engineering-based studies maintain that major efficiency improvements (and hence CO2 reductions) can be obtained at little or no cost. These estimates have been included in Figure 8 as indicative bottom-up cost estimates.As with the global studies, a wide range of cost estimates is observable. For example, for the same loss of GNP of about 2%, CO2 emission reductions can range from 20% (US Congressional Budget Office-CBO-78) to 80% (Manne & Richels-40) below baseline. One major reason for such differences is that the reductions are sought on different timescales; the CBO study seeks a 20% reduction by 2000, while the 80% reduction in the Manne & Richels study is achieved at the end of the next century.Excepting the very rapid reductions imposed in the CBO studies for the year 2000, the early Goulder (74) studies form a high-cost outlier.9 Bottom-up studies, and those that examine the recycling of tax revenues (discussed below) have produced some very low and negative abatement cost estimates. These studies are discussed in Sections 7 and 8 below.Excepting these, the spread of results is pretty consistent with the global results, with 50% emission reductions from baseline yielding losses up to a little more than 2% of GNP. The coincidence between US and global results may reflect partially the importance of US emissions and costs, but also the dominance of US-based modeling approaches in global studies.Non-US OECD StudiesTable 3 lists a number of emissions reduction studies of non-US OECO countries. One striking feature is that nearly all these studies have a much shorter term focus than the global studies or most of the US studies: most in fact are focused either on emissions stabilization by 2000 or on the "Toronto target" of 20% reduction by 2005.The results are displayed in Figure 9. Immense variation is once again apparent, even in terms of reductions from the baseline projection. No clear pattern emerges, other than the fact that the bottom-lip studies again give much lower costs (see also the detailed bottom-up comparative studies of EC member countries discussed in the previous section). We have not included these or many other bottom-up studies that repeat the message; nor have we included studies by Data Resources Inc. for the US Department of Commerce (49) for different reasons.10In general, the cost range is broader than in the global studies, perhaps reflecting the impact of transitional costs arising from the relatively rapid reductions required in some of these studies, captured by the short-run models, an issue discussed further below. The detailed EC studies of the macro-economic impacts of carbon taxation, using short-run macro-economic models, produce a wide variety of results; these results depend heavily on how the tax revenues are used, as discussed in Section 8.1 below where we argue that the extremes of the short-run cost estimates (high and low) are not useful as a guide to real CO2 abatement costs because they reflect rather the use of a tax to ship resources from one kind of economic activity to another. The Finnish study by Christensen (141), with very high losses for modest reductions by 2010, is a similar outlier on the high side, and two of the Japanese studies also yield exceptionally high costs (for the Yamaji study (118) at least this is because the carbon tax revenues are removed from the economy). The variations make it hard to discern any pattern, but even with these outliers excluded, the relative costs for these short-run, national reductions are mostly somewhat larger than for equivalent long-run reductions in the US and global studies, with several exceeding 3% GNP losses.The Transitional EconomiesStudies of abatement costs for the former centrally planned economies of Eastern Europe, listed in Table 4, have also used both top-down and bottom-up approaches, but data are insufficient to summarize usefully as a scatter diagram. An energy technology cost curve estimated for Poland (50, 51) has been shown above (Figure 3). Figure 10 shows a more general curve of the cost of energy savings, based on a number of Soviet technology studies, set against the estimated cost of supply, for the former Soviet Union (52). All of these bottom-up studies indicate a large potential for reducing CO2 emissions with net economic savings; in Figure 10, the marginal cost of savings only rises above that of new supply for savings well in excess of 10 EJ, which is more than 20% of Soviet primary energy demand in 1989.This potential arises from the history of highly subsidized energy prices in these regions, and other cumulative inefficiencies in the structure of incentives. Note also from Figure 10 that the economic savings potential is around 10% greater if the Soviet Union can access Western technologies. Unterwurzacher & Wirl (53) estimated in 1991 that increasing prices to world market levels in Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia would reduce emissions by 30%. Of course, the realizable potential may be a very different matter and depends in part on the progress of economic restructuring. In fact CO2 emissions in the former East Germany have collapsed by at least 30% as uncompetitive heavy industry has more or less shut down in the process of unification. In Poland, provisional trend/ technology results also indicate significant CO2 reductions as a by-product of the economic restructuring process (.54).Manne & Kichels include the Soviet Unionas an independent region in their Global 2100 model. and calculate much higher GNP losses [5% in (39), reduced to 3% in (40)] there than for the rest of the world in the first half of the next century. This striking contrast with bottom-up studies reflects the difficulties top-down studies have with economies undergoing restructure. They rely on the existence of a market mechanism that in many instances is barely functioning, and such studies will likely miss many of the important features of these economies, such as current structural inefficiencies. It may take some time before a market -based modeling approach bccomes appropriate. For the present, bottom-up engineering assessments appear much more relevant.Developing Countries including ChinaSome of the above issues also apply to developing countries. Although concerns are frequently expressed about the limited data available concerning developing countries, considerable data exist concerning the situation in mast major developing countries especially with respect to commercial energy supply. Data on detailed end-uses, agriculture, and noncommercial energy sectors is sparser and less reliable, though usable estimates exist.The past few years have also seen a number of studies of the potential for abating greenhouse gases in developing countries. Some of these are reported in Table 5. For example, the country reports to the IPCC Energy and Industries subgroup (55) did include a number of studies from developing countries, some drawing on more extensive internal work. In addition, Sathaye (56) reported initial results from a series of nine developing-country studies coordinated by the US Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. However, these studies focused on scenarios and did not attempt to estimate abatement costs. Some of the detailed studies for the Asian Energy Institute network reported in the UNEP study (16, Chapter 5) attempt bottom-up estimates of short-term abatement costs or investment requirements.Some of the global models do separate developing-country and oil-exporting regions. The global studies have also highlighted the growing importance of China in contributing to greenhouse gas emissions during the next century. The early Manne & Richels results (39) suggested that Chinese GNP in the year 2050 could be depressed by up to 8% below the (greatly increased) reference level, if emissions are restricted to no more than double current levels, partly because of the apparent lack of alternatives to coal and modeling inability to import energy [though this was reduced to a 2% GNP loss, rising to 5% by 2100, in revised analysis (40)]. The GREEN model suggests much lower abatement costs for China (44).In estimates derived from global studies that model trade (e.g. 36, 37), GNP impacts for some of the smaller developing countries especially can be dominated by trade and price effects arising from the action of other countries. These studies emphasize the large potential GNP loss for energy-exporting developing countries: the loss could arise from abatement efforts elsewhere that depress the market for traded fuels. Conversely, energy-importing countries (which include the poorest countries) would gain from such effects.Concerning domestic abatement efforts, a number of cost curves have been estimated (see e.g. Figure 2 for Brazil), which indicate substantial technical potential for savings with net economic benefits. However, the only integrated system-wide cost estimates that the authors could find, excepting those from global models for China, are those of Blitzer et al (57, 58) for Egypt and an unpublished study of Zimbabwe by the UK consultants Touche Ross, reported in UNEP (16).The Blitzer et al studies estimate a very large potential GNP impact from stabilizing CO2 emissions in Egypt, with losses in some cases of more than 10% of GNP. This is based on a short-run macro-economic model of the Egyptian economy that is modeled with very limited capita! mobility between sectors, and with oil and gas as the only future energy supply options. It recognizes none of the technical inefficiencies in the economy (i.e. assumes zero scope for cost-free energy-efficiency improvements). Excepting the modest abatement available from switching from oil to gas, emissions savings can only be achieved by reducing energy consumption, which, given the constraints on capital mobility, can only be achieved by reducing economic activity or changing its structure. Consequently, the costs reported are clearly excessive. However, separate runs of the model that placed emission constraints on each sector of the economy individually did emphasize that GNP losses would be greater still if these additional restrictions were imposed.The Touche Ross study of Zimbabwe reached precisely opposite conclusions. Using an engineering approach, widespread cost-effective options were identified that could both limit emissions growth and improve overall economic performance. However, these assessments neglect a variety of hidden costs and fundamental institutional obstacles; they also include some elements that are expected to be achieved anyway as part of current structural adjustments in the Zimbabwean economy. These and other limitations, which suggest that abatement costs in this case may be substantially underestimated, are summarized in the Zimbabwean case study of the UNEP report (16).The limited range and appropriateness of studies for the transitional and developing economies make the use of scatter diagrams, as were used for presenting OECD results, not in our judgment very meaningful in this case. We do, however, note one striking observation; the gap between top-down and bottom-up approaches is larger even than observed for OECD countries. Top-down models mostly report restricting developing-country emissions, even relative to projected increases, to be more expensive than equivalent relative constraints in OECD countries [e.g. Rutherford (41)11]. It is not clear why this should be the case. Bottom-up studies, conversely, identify a potential for improving energy-efficiency in these regions at a net economic benefit that is even larger than that identified for OECD countries.Despite this, it seems possible to draw two firm observations from the existing developing-country emissions abatement studies: many cost-effective technology options exist for improving energy-efficiency; but such potential will be swamped by the pressure for emissions growth in such rapidly expanding economies, so that actually stabilizing developing- country emissions at current levels is nevertheless likely to be very costly. More sophisticated and quantitative system-wide analysis of abatement impacts is, however, only just beginning, and as outlined in UNEP ( 16), the complexities are such that it may take many years to mature towards consensus even on very rough cost estimates and understanding of the key issues.MODEL SCOPE AND TYPEThe review of cost estimates in the previous two sections shows the enormous disparity in modeling results. It is very difficult to disentangle the various reasons for these differences, due to the nonlinearity of the relationships involved, the diversity of the tools used to develop emissions reductions cost estimates, the many and varied assumptions employed, and the enormity of the task required to obtain all of the models, establish a protocol for analysis, and systematically unravel the relative contributions. First steps in that direction have been taken by teams at the Energy Modeling Forum (59-62) and OECD (63, 64). In both cases, participating modelers were asked to adopt standard assumptions to the degree possible and to provide standardized model results. Both sets of comparisons have focused on top-down models (the Energy Modeling Forum recently embarked on a similar exercise with "bottom-up" models). It is clear from these activities that great variation in results can be generated through the use of different models. This variation is greatly reduced through the use of standardized assumptions.In this section we identify the different types of models used, and discuss some of the implications that might be expected to flow from the selection of a particular model type. The following section then discusses data differences. Then, in Sections 7 and 8 we analyze the factors that appear to have the most significant impact on abatement cost estimates.We begin by noting that all models share certain unavoidable limitations:1. First, a model is necessarily a simplified representation of reality, in terms of what the concerned researchers feel are important aspects that should be captured. A given model may not capture all the important economic relationships.2. Second, despite these simplifications, all such models are still rather complex and must necessarily rely on a large quantity of data and numerous parameter estimates. Robust estimation of these is itself a major research undertaking, and serious doubts may arise about the validity of many of the actual numerical values employed. Studies of model sensitivities, and structured uncertainty studies in which the values of key parameters are varied over plausible ranges, are required to examine how much these uncertainties may affect model results. Such studies have often not been adequately performed.3. Third, the timescales involved require assumptions to be made about changes in technology and life-styles. Conjectures about such changes are inevitably uncertain and cannot be formally validated.These limitations may be exacerbated by the fact that most studies employ models that were not initially designed to shell light on the cost of emissions reductions [exceptions are the OECD's GREEN model (43. 64) the ERB (3, 4), and the forthcoming Second Generation Model (SGM) (65)].Consequently, all modeling results need to be treated with some caution, depending in part on the timescale of application, the care with which the model has been developed, the extent to which it is appropriate to the application used, and the care with which inputs have been formulated. The ultimate argument for such modeling efforts is not that they give precise and certain answers, but rather that they are the only consistent way of estimating abatement costs at all and of identifying the important factors that affect them.Energy-economy models can be classified in various ways. In this section we draw distinctions along six dimensions of classification."Top-Down" and "Bottom-up" ModelsWe have noted the major distinction between "top-down" economic models and "bottom-up engineering/technology-based models. We noted that high positive abatement costs are frequently associated with top-down/economic approaches and low and negative costs are frequently associated with bottom- up/engineering approaches.As outlined in Section 2, the underlying theoretical distinction lies between the economic and engineering paradigms. This can be discussed in terms of a relatively simple illustration (Figure 11). In economics. technology is featured as the set of techniques by which inputs, such as capital. labor and energy, can be transformed into useful outputs. The figure shows a graph of energy versus other (e.g. capital) inputs. Each cross represents an individual technique or technology. The "best" technique define the "production frontier," as illustrated. In principle, efficient markets should result in investment only in the technically efficient techniques on this frontier (after allowing for lags associated with old stock), because such investments can reduce all costs compared with other technologies.Economic models all assume that markets work efficiently in the sense that all new investments (after allowing for hidden costs) define the "production frontier." This is assumed to be consistent with cost-minimizing (or utility-maximizing) behavior in response to the observed price signals: various models can encompass other inefficiencies, such as externalities and fiscal imperfections arising from taxes and subsidies, but still share this assumption.Observed behavior (historical data) combined with the optimizing assumption defines an observed production frontier. The models assume that no investments are available that lie beyond this frontier (though future technical change may move it). To the extent that real-world inefficiencies exist, they are implicitly incorporated in the inferred frontier. Relative price changes move investments along this frontier (e.g. substitute labor for energy) as defined by the estimated elasticities; a purely economic model has no explicit technologies, which are simply implicit in the elasticities used.Studies using engineering models have often focused on identifying potential least-cost abatement opportunities by assessing directly the costs of all the technological options. Such assessment is independent of observed market behavior. This also defines a "production frontier." If markets are technically efficient, the "frontier" revealed by market behavior should correspond to that calculated by engineering studies. As illustrated previously, this is not the case. Engineering studies reveal widespread potential for investments beyond the limit of the "production frontier" suggested by market behavior and built into economic models. The explanation can he considered in terms of the contrasting limitations of the economic and engineering paradigms. Economic models are slave to the assumption of cost-minimizing behavior noted above. Limitations of purely engineering models include:1. The cost concept is based on an idealized evaluation of technologies and options. The existence of hidden costs is typically ignored.2. The cost of implementation measures (e.g. information campaigns, standard setting, and compliance processes) is not included.3. Market imperfections and other economic barriers mean that the technical potential can never be fully realized.4. Macro-economic relationships (multiplier effects, structural effects, price effects) and indicators (GNP, employment, etc) are not included in the modelsTop-down and bottom-up are very imprecise terms. Although models generally known as "top-down" all determine energy demand through aggregate, economically driven indices (GNP and/or productivity growth, and price elasticities), they can vary greatly in the modeling of energy supply. Some of the "top-down" models are purely economic, with supply changes being driven only by substitution elasticities. Others are primarily economic, but incorporate a "backstop technology"--a technology that can come in, in unlimited quantities, once a certain price threshold is reached. Yet in other "top-down" models (such as the ERB), supply is driven largely on an engineering basis of supply technology costs, chosen from a database of supply technology cost curves.Nearly all "bottom-up" models contain extensive representation of supply technologies, but the key practical distinction as it has emerged in the CO2 costing literature centers on the modeling of energy end- use and the introduction of end-use technologies. Bottom-up end-use studies indicate a large potential for reducing both emissions and costs relative to a traditional top-down extrapolation of energy demand. In other words, they show that the top-down projections are not optimal in terms of the technologies available; and the major savings come by contrasting this with a scenario that is an engineering optimum.Why does this create such a large difference between bottom-up and topdown studies? The primary reason is to be found in Figure 5. which was discussed in Section 3. Neglecting the segment referring to externalities, which may or may not be reflected in either top-down or bottom-up studies, top-down projections of energy demand incorporate only efficiency improvements corresponding to the bottom segment of the column--the "business as usual" takeup. Bottom-up models, on the other hand, include all the available technologies, without distinction as to under which category in the column they fall. Consequently, we can conclude with some confidence that, neglecting externalities:1. top-down modeling studies tend to underestimate the potential for lowcost efficiency improvements (and overestimate abatement costs) because they ignore a whole category of gains that could be tapped by nonprice policy changes; whereas2. bottom-up end-use modeling studies overestimate the potential (and underestimate abatement costs) because they neglect various "hidden" costs and constraints that limit the uptake of apparently cost-effective technologies .Which is more "realistic" depends on the relative size of different segments in Figure 5--something that cannot be determined without separate study of specific implementation policies and costs, discussed in Section 7.2. But we can say with some confidence that the real near-term potential for limiting CO2 emissions at low or negative costs lies somewhere between the optimism of such bottom-up studies, and the relative pessimism of many top-down studies. Finally, we note that although these issues are most important relative to demand, they also can apply to energy supply, particularly concerning apparently "cost-effective" decentralized renewable energy options that are nevertheless not being exploited.We emphasize again that the systematically differing results are largely a reflection of the non-optimality of the baseline implicit in such bottom- up studies--and the questions it raises about the assumptions built into top- down model baseline and abatement projections. This is perhaps the key difference between the modeling approaches. If the baseline in bottom-up studies used optimal technologies, the baseline emission projections would be much lower. This was illustrated clearly in a study by Morris et al (66), which included end-use technologies in the MARKAL engineering model and found that obtaining basecase emissions anything near as high as official or macro-economic forecasts proved almost impossible: the model chose more energy-efficient end-use technologies, and more renewable energy technologies, irrespective of CO2 constraints. Further reductions were, however, relatively expensive, relying more on supply substitution, as the stock of more efficient end-use technologies was largely selected already in the optimal baseline.Thus there is no inherent reason why "top-down" studies should yield positive costs or "bottom-up" models should yield negative costs. The sign of the cost hinges critically on the approach applied to computing costs, in particular, assumptions regarding optimality of the baseline. For example, Bradley et al (67) and Edmonds, Barns,Wise, and Ton (68) recognize a non- optimal baseline and illustrate negative abatement costs within a "topdown" energy-economy approach; whereas the Morris et al (66) study uses a wholly engineering model and obtains positive costs for any reductions beyond those captured in the (optimal, and much lower) baseline.Some attempts have been made to integrate top-down and bottom-up models explicitly. Most notably, the Global 2100 model has been linked with the MARKAL engineering model (by replacing the energy technology submodel in Global 2100 that formed the energy component previously) in a bid to combine the best features of both into a single computational framework (69). However, this still does not resolve the dilemma about whether projections, for baseline or abatement scenarios, adopt the engineering optimum or econometric extrapolation of energy demand, and this linked model has been criticized on the grounds that one still dominates the other (70).Time Horizons and Adjustment Processes: Short term Transitional versus Long-term EquilibriumDifferent models are designed for application over different timescales. There are no standard definitions, but in many relevant branches of economic analysis the short term is taken to be less than 5 years, the medium term is between 3 and 15 years, and the long term is more than 10 years. The timescale is a distinction of major importance, particularly for economic models, because different economic processes are important on different timescales, and thus the timescale for which models are designed fundamentally affects their structures and objectives. Models for relatively long-run analysis may to a reasonable approximation assume an economic equilibrium in which resources are fully allocated. Short-run models focus on "transitional" and disequilibrium effects such as transitional market responses, capital constraints, unemployment, and inflation. This distinction parallels the structural distinction drawn by Boero et al (71) between resource allocation models and macro-economic models.MEDIUM TO LONG TERM: EQUILIBRIUM/RESOURCE ALLOCATION MODELS These models focus on the allocation of available resources, within the energy sector or the broader economy. This category includes both optimizing bottom-up models (which seek to optimize resource allocation within the bounds set by available technology). and all the main long-run and global energy/C02 models. The latter are generally termed equilibrium models .At one extreme of the long-term modeling dimension are models that can only consider the energy/inveshnent mix for a "snapshot" year and compare this to another, without any information on the transition between them; these are comparative static models, such as the Whalley & Wigle model (36, 37) and an early form of the GREEN model (72). Such models can enable detail in representing the system, but at the expense of modeling developments over time. In contrast, dynamic models cover medium-and long-term phenomena, extending across several time periods.At the opposite of this extreme within the equilibrium models, some are designed to run in annual steps over a period of a few decades. These can include considerable detail on different sectors, whose use of different resources in response to price changes is estimated econometrically from data over previous years. The main examples are the Jorgensen/Wilcoxen (73) and Goulder (74) models for the United States.Equilibrium models such as Global 2100 and GREEN [in its more recent versions (43, 64)] and the ERB model lie between these extremes. They are designed to operate in steps of 5-15 years, to look at the changing allocation of resources under different constraints over periods of many decades, and the way this may change under CO2 constraints.The treatment of capital stocks in these models can have important implications for costs. "Putty-putty" models represent capital stocks as perfectly interchangeable between sectors and over time. Nuclear power plants can be transformed into solar photovoltaic arrays instantaneously and without cost. "Putty-clay" models, on the other hand, allow no transfer of capital between applications. Once an investment has occurred, the technology cannot be altered (sec Section 8.3). Resource allocation/equilibrium models cannot, however, model other aspects of transitional costs arising from disequilibria. In this respect, and in their assumption of optimal investments subject to constraints, they have been criticized for underestimating likely abatement costs (though the satire caveats apply to the reference projection as well, which is similarly optimal within constraints and free from disequilibria).SHORT TO MEDIUM RUN: MARKET SIMULATION/MACROECONOMIC MODELS Short-run models by contrast focus primarily or exclusively on the dynamics of transition, rather than the long-term equilibrium allocation of resources.One class of short-run models are sectoral market simulation models, such as detailed models of electricity or oil markets and pricing, or of industrial sector energy demand. The diversity of such models reflects the range of specific markets that they have attempted to model. Few such models as yet appear to have been applied to assessing abatement costs; one notable exception is the application by Ingham, Maw, and Ulph (75) of separate market models for the industrial, domestic, and transport sectors in the United Kingdom. However, such models may come to assume much greater importance as governments move closer to considering detailed policy measures tailored to specific sectors. Frequently (as in 75) they focus on sector responses to carbon taxes rather than costs.Of more general interest for costing is the recent application of models known usually simply as macro-economic models. This is the name usually (if imprecisely) given to the models developed over many years for studying the short-run dynamic behavior of national economies. Typically these models contain explicit representation of investment and consumption in different sectors, and markets do not necessarily clear; there can be unemployment, idle production capacity, or capital shortage. Such models generally contain a strong Keynesian component, though many other aspects of macro-economic theory have also been brought to bear in them. Recent applications to CO2 abatement are discussed below.Such models can generate a wide range of macro-economic indices such as GNP, inflation, employments, etc. For this reason they are of particular interest for assessing the short-term macro-economic impact of CO2 abatement, However, such models may contain very limited representation of the energy sector, and some may not even model energy as a separate good within the economy. Few contain a representative set of energy-technology options. Such short-run macro-economic models are thus highly country- and model-specific, and vary greatly in the extent to which they can be applied to assessing CO2 abatement. The models are best at representing transitional costs; results may become unstable and questionable when the models are run too far ahead, because the economic feedbacks that keep economies from straying too far frolic economic equilibrium are generally not well represented.No study has focused primarily on a comparison of short-run macroeconomic with general equilibrium (GE) models, but such a comparison is implicit in the studies of Shackleton et al (76). This took two macroeconomic models (DRI and LINK) and two general equilibrium models (DGEM and Goulder), all of which the model authors considered appropriate to run over a period of 2-3 decades. Each was subject to the same carbon tax ($40 per ton C). Figure 12 shows that the models behaved in very different ways. Concerning the impact on CO2, the macro models suggest a reduction of 0-8% depending on the way in which carbon tax revenues are used (see Section 8. 1; even a C02 increase is observed from a tax recycling that boosts economic growth); the equilibrium models suggest 20-30% reductions depending only on which model is used. Even more striking, the macro models show a wide variety of GNP responses, varying greatly over time, and including substantial increases from some tax recycling options; the GE models show a much smoother response, with more modest impacts.All this corresponds to the theoretical differences. The short-run macro models reflect the resistance of the economy to change, but also the cumulative impact of greater investment unconstrained by equilibrium requirements. The GE models allow capital to move easily across the economy to respond to the price changes, giving a much stronger CO2 response. It seems reasonable to suggest that the longer- term results from the short-run macro-economic models are questionable (and highly sensitive to various assumed macro-economic investment and other responses), as are the short term GE results; the most realistic outcome may be to assume a progression over time from the macro towards the GE results, but even this is speculative. Beyond this we cannot generalize, but we emphasize the importance of resolving such great variation based purely on model structure. McKibben & Wilcoxen (33) are the only researchers to have yet applied a model that can simultaneously address unemployment and GE class problems.Finally we note that between the short-and long-run models, some progress has been made in developing medium-run models that combine elements from both short-run macro-economic and resource allocation/ equilibrium models [see discussion in Boero et al (71)]. These may be seen as short-run models that are expanded to include adjustment to long-term equilibria. That is, medium-run models are mainly demand determined and allow for market disequilibria; however, a central part of the models aims to describe the adjustment process from short-term market disequilibria to long-term market equilibria. Finally, we note that there are some top-down modeling approaches that do not fit into these categories at all, such as the growth models employed by Nordhaus (35) and Anderson & Bird (45).Sectoral Coverage: Energy versus General EconomyAnother important distinction is that between models that address only a limited part of the economy (in this case, the energy sector) and those that encompass the whole economy, which usually have a much more simplified representation of any particular sector. Among equilibrium models, the distinction is known as that between partial equilibriumand general equilibrium models; the parallel distinction for short-run models is that between energy market and macro-economic models; a more general terminology would be that of [energy] sector general economy model.Sectoral models focus heavily or exclusively on particular economic sectors (in this case, usually just the energy sector or parts thereof): insofar as the rest of the economy is represented, it is in a highly simplified way. They address the problem of describing behavior in a single area of the economy, for exampic energy, but ignore or treat summarily all other economic functions. An energy market model would have no description of the labor or capital markets.Energy sector models come in many varieties. Bottom-up technology models are all sectoral; so are many equilibrium models. such as the ERB (3, 4). Investment planning models, such as the electricity expansion models widely used for assessing power sector investments, are more focused sectoral models. Models of the international oil market--a very important but little analyzed issue in assessing abatement costs--are sectoral but global models.Sectoral models yield an estimate of costs in a particular sector, but cannot take account of the macro-economic linkages of that sector with the rest of the economy. They cannot, for example, estimate how the labor or investment requirements in that sector may affect the resources available to other sectors.By contrast, general economy models encompass all major economic sectors simultaneously. They recognize feedbacks and interrelationship between sectors. In principle, this enables them to estimate the full long-run GNP impacts of restrictions (such as CO2 constraints). In practice, this is obtained at the expense of considerable simplification of the energy sector.General economy models are the only kind that can reflect important features in the rest of the economy. This may include, for example, economic distortions outside the energy sector. In particular, existing taxes impose varying burdens on economies. If the revenues from a carbon tax are used to reduce such taxes, the gains may in principle offset the losses, completely altering assumptions about the net impact on the GNP of such taxes. This seems to have attracted attention only recently [Dower & Zimmerman (77)]; relatively early discussions of this are given by the CBO (78) and Grubb (79), and subsequent modeling studies are reviewed in Section 7.The past few years have seen the development of linked models that seek to integrate the detail of energy sector models with the economic consistency of general economy models. In Europe, the macro-economic HERMES model has been linked with the MIDAS energy supply model and applied to analyzing abatement strategies in the four largest EC countries, including interactions between these economies (80), to generate the results illustrated in Figure 9. The Manne & Richels GLOBAL 2100 model (39) contains considerably more energy supply detail than other general equilibrium models by integrating an energy technology model (ETA) into a simple general equilibrium model (MACRO, which clears markets for all goods and services treated as a single aggregate). The SGM (65), which is under development, extends this approach. It is a general equilibrium model that was designed to address greenhouse-related issues, and thus desegregates economic activities on the basis of importance to the greenhouse issue.The ERB model is an energy market rather than general economy model. but it contains a "GNP feedback" parameter, which was incorporated to ensure that the impact of large changes in energy sector costs on the scale of economic activity would be reflected in terms of its impact back on energy demand. The parameter is not intended to provide consistent estimates of the costs of emissions reductions, though many studies have used it as such.l2 As noted above, costs must be developed using consumer plus producer surplus techniques (81, 82). Other sectoral models, such as Fossil2 (83), require similar approaches to make consistent cost estimates.Optimization and Simulation TechniquesLargely independent of the above differences. models can adopt different approaches to optimization. Some models optimize energy investments over time by minimizing explicitly the total discounted costs (or per capita consumption), using linear or nonlinear techniques. Several engineering models use linear programming, most notably the EFOM model (29) used extensively within the EC, and MARKAL (84), promoted internationally by the ETSAP program of the International Energy Agency. The top-down Global 2100 model uses nonlinear dynamic optimization, as does its derivative CETA (42). Such optimization approaches in effect assume perfect investment (within the confines of the model), with perfect foresight. It is debatable whether this is a drawback or advantage.13Modeling partial foresight is, however, very difficult, and the main alternative approach is to simulate investment decisions on the basis of "static expectations," i.e. static projection of conditions at the time of investment. This "myopic" assumption is used in ERB. GREEN. and the CRTM trading derivative of Global 2100 according to Dean & Hoeller (64), no software yet exists for solving such large dynamic general equilibrium models under the assumption of perfect foresight. The SGM model is being developed to incorporate a variety of options for determining investments on the basis of future expectations (including a fomiulation of partial foresight).Thus the mechanism for selecting investments is fundamentally different between investment simulation and optimization models, and this might be expected to have a major impact on results. In fact, this does not appear to be the case. A recent comparison by the Energy Modeling Forum (unpublished) of results from global 2100 (dynamic optimization) with those from the ERB model (investment simulation) shows that standardizing for key assumptions leads to remarkably similar energy and emission results. Assuming a competitive economy, variations in key input assumptions (such as those discussed below) thus appear far more important than the approach used for selecting investments in the model.Short-run macro-economic models are concerned primarily with the simulation of aggregated investment responses in terms of labor, capital, etc but do not seek to optimize divestments; they do not represent specific technologies at all. Some other models are purely for simulation of system operation, without automated invested modeling, and they report on the implications of an investment strategy that is specified externally [e.g. the Danish BRUS model (85)]. This can enable much greater detail in representing the system. and avoids the limitations of linear optimization especially, though there are inevitably drawbacks from having to specify investments manually and check their consistency [UNEP (16), Chapter 3)].Level of AggregationModels differ greatly in their degree of disaggregation. To some extent this is the obverse of the model scope. Models that, for example, focus on household electricity demand can represent this and the options for improving household electricity efhciency, in great detail. Global, economy-wide models have to be highly aggregated.At one end of the spectrum are models such as LEAP (86) and the BRUS model (85) used in the Danish Energy 2000 study (87). Their demand sectors are generally disaggregated with respect to specific industrial subsectors and processes. residential and service categories, transport modes, etc. with the aim of achieving homogeneous entities whose long-term behavior can be defined through consistent scenario projections. Similarly, energy conversion and supply technologies are represented at the plant type and device levels. This allows detailed modeling of the alternatives for technical innovation, fuel switching, etc.With regard to emissions of pollutants and CO2, this type of disaggregation into specific technologies makes it possible to take account of the different characteristics of energy technologies. A very detailed analysis of abatement options can thus be carried out. This will include energy savings at the end-use level, changes in the conversion system, and fuel substitution. At the other end of the spectrum are models such as GREEN and Global 2100, which treat energy and the world in a highly aggregated manner.In general, the level of aggregation is closely related to the other aspects; for example, a multiperiod, global, general-economy model by necessity will have a highly aggregated representation of energy demand and supply. with little if any technological detail. Great detail in representing energy supply, conversion, and end-use markets and technologies is only possible in models that are specific to the energy sector, and focus on simulation rather than full system optimization. The benefits need to be weighed against these limitations.Geographic Coverage, Trade, and "Leakage"Another important division of scope is geographical. Global models describe the world economy divided into "regions" such as North America, Europe, the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC), Southern Asia, etc. and many can represent interactions via trade and monetary transactions between different parts of the world economy. Global models have been developed and applied primarily to examine aggregate questions such as the likely rate and pattern of emissions growth, the relative gains and losses from differing distributions of international CO2-reduction and international interactions of abatement efforts, including trade issues. A limited number of global models have been applied, as summarized in Section 4.1.National models focus on specific aspects of single countries and can give more detailed descriptions of the economic interactions within the country. World market conditions are normally taken as exogenous. It is possible, however, to link national models; trade and monetary transactions between countries may be endogenized in order to analyze the effects that national policies in one country may have on the economy of other countries.Allowing trade in goods and emission targets lowers overall abatement costs. Cline (17, Chapter 4) criticizes the Global 2100 model for its lack of trade in either production or energy resources, which leads to each region effectively optimizing its economy using only local resources, and thus increasing the global cost of reducing CO2 emissions. Trade in emissions rights can lead to significantly lower costs in achieving overall emissions reductions (see Section 8.3). However, while overall costs may be reduced through trade, individual nations may either gain or lose, depending on the allocation of emissions rights [Edmonds et al (68)].Global abatement efforts will affect internationally traded fuel prices, and thus have particular impacts on countries that depend heavily on energy exports or imports. Any study that does not take the global perspective into account may underestimate the economic impact of measures to reduce CO2 on energy-exporting countries and overestimate that on energy-importing countries. Marks et al (88) address this issue by looking at the effect of a fall in the world price of coal; Perroni & Rutherford (89), tile OECD studies (notably Ref. 90), and Whalley & Wigle (36, 37) also address the issue of trade. Global models are also required to examine the issue of "leakage," by which abatement in one region may be offset by international price and trade reactions (discussed in Section 8).The cost estimates of studies that take these trade issues into account do not therefore simply reflect the impact of the domestic policies on the economy. A distinction needs to be made between the costs that stem from the domestic policy options and the economic impact of trade effects and capital transfers.Modeling Classifications: A ResumeAn understanding of different models is required because different models have different strengths and weaknesses. Models for studying CO2 abatement costs have been developed in different ways, often by adapting existing models. They are able to handle some issues (or sectors) better than others: different models are thus suited to different purposes. Models cannot--or at least should not--be interpreted as giving complete and accurate answers, but rather used for the insights they offer when the results are combined with an understanding of the model structure and limitations.There is no universal or accepted way of classifying models. In this section we have noted at least six dimensions. Of these the division between "top-down" economic and "bottom-up" engineering is of great practical importance, despite its occasional ambiguity. Within top-down models, the distinction between long-run equilibrium and shorter-run macro-economic models is central, as is that between partial (sectoral) and general economy models. Neither of these latter distinctions is relevant to bottom-up models, for which important distinctions are those between partial models (generating a cost curve of savings related to a topdown or unspecified baseline), and full system representation, and within the latter, the choice between optimization and simulation. Table 6 classifies the major models discussed in this paper according to this schemes which has a pragmatic focus on the factors of greatest importance to abatement costing. Other classification approaches by Boero et al (71), and Beaver (60, 61) have similar elements but differ he detail.NUMERICAL ASSUMPTIONS AND SENSITIVITIESAssumptions drive model results. Critical parameters can be usefully (though not exclusively) divided into those that govern the overall scale of the system and reference missions, and those that directly affect the relative cost of emissions reductions. GNP and population growth rates, income elasticities and the rate of "autonomous end-use energy-intensity improvement" ("AEEI") primarily affect the baseline scale; background fossil-fuel prices strongly affect both the baseline emissions and abatement costs; the cost of low-carbon technologies and price elasticities largely drive abatement costs though they also affect baseline emissions.Population and GNP Growth RatesThe demand for energy is driven by population and per capita energy demand, and all economic models at least assume that the latter is driven by per capita GNP. It is consequently much more difficult to restrict the growth in emissions for a developing country with a high population and economic growth rate, such as India, than for a more slowly growing developed economy, for example, Germany, which has a static or declining population.The uncertainties in future global population are reflected in abatement studies; estimates for the year 2025 for example include 9.5 billion for the NAS (47) and 8.2 billion for Edmonds & Barns (81). However, the latter study found that there was little impact from a reduction in population growth for approximately 15 years, that is until labor force and therefore GNP was affected. Projections suggest that the increase in global GNP will be much greater anal more uncertain than population growth. and so differences in GNP projections account for a greater part of variation in baseline emissions.Different baseline GNP and energy demand assumptions across studies complicate comparisons of the GNP loss associated with a target CO2 reduction. In models that derive GNP from labor productivity, this is correspondingly critical. For example, in the United States in 2020, GNP baseline estimates range from $7.5 to $11.5 trillion [CSIS (91) and Edmonds & Barns (82), respectively]; the low costs of CO2 stabilization in the Jorgenson & Wilcoxen (92) study have been attributed partially to their lower GNP projection.The difference that baseline GNP makes to energy demand is more complex, as growth in any economy will inevitably vary across sectors over time; greater GNP growth in reality would not necessarily imply that the growth within all sectors of the economy is increased proportionately.Energy/GNP Relations/tips and the "AEEI"While GNP is a major determinant of energy demand, many factors can affect the relationship between them. A few models incorporate explicitly a non-unitary energy-income elasticity, which implies a changing energy/GNP ratio as GNP grows. Most models, however, express such a change, if any, in terms of an exogenous parameter that defines the rate at which the energy/GNP ratio would change in the absence of price changes. This rate of exogenous (or "autonomous") end-use energy-intensity improvement (AEEI) then becomes a major determinant of baseline energy demand for long-term projection; the higher the rate of energy-intensity improvement, the lower will be the baseline CO2 emissions, and the lower the costs of reducing relative to a given base year. The parameter has been widely described as a measure of technical progress, but as we emphasize below (Section 7.2), it compounds many different elements.A range of AEEls has been adopted. The main studies with the GREEN (44) and ERB (3, 4, 68, 81, 82) models assume an AEEI of 1% per year for all of the regions of the world. Manne & Richels (39) assumed a more pessimistic set of values averaging 0.4% for the world, while Mintzer (13) adopts a much more optimistic 1.5%. The difference in values between the Manne & Richels and the ERB studies account for a very large difference in long-term projected baselines (respectively, 40 and 23 Mt C per year by 2100) . The sensitivity study by Edmonds & Barns (81) confirms the importance of this parameter. In their later sensitivity analysis, Manne & Richels (40, 94) used AEEls ranging from 0% to 1.5%. With an AEEI at 1.5%, the energy requirements at the end of the next century would be one-fifth of the demand had an AEEI of 0% been used.Future Energy Prices, Resource Modeling, and Supply ElasticitiesHigh background fossil-fuel prices lower energy demand and CO2 emissions, and reduce the relative costs of moving to lower carbon fuels. Limited resources (e.g. of oil) have the same effect, implicitly or explicitly raising the prices as resources are depleted. Resources are, however, uncertain, and the course of fuel prices is even more uncertain.Various approaches may be taken towards estimating the future cost and availability of different fuels. National studies may define national production costs but define exogenous global prices with great variation; for example, Chandler & Nicholls (95) assume that prices of natural gas and oil will rise by 2.5% per year and those for electricity and coal by 1% per year, while the OTA (48) projects prices for these fuels to rise at around 4% per year and nearly 2% per year, respectively.Global models reflect resource/supply cost issues explicitly, through direct estimation of the resource base and supply elasticities. High supply elasticities mean lower fuel price rises as supply increases. GREEN assumes zero supply elasticity for oil outside OPEC (i.e. volume set by fixed production constraints), but price is determined by OPEC supply elasticities varying from 1 to 3; supply elasticities are higher for gas and coal and much lower for non-fossil sources until backstop technologies become relevant.14 The OECD analysts involved (43, 64) note estimates of supply elasticities to be very uncertain, and other models assume 1.0 where relevant.Price/Substitution Elasticity of Demand for EnergyThe impact of price changes on energy demand is determined by the price elasticity of energy demand, or in general economy models, the substitution elasticity between energy and other factors of production. The lower the relevant elasticity, the less energy demand is curtailed by higher energy prices, and the greater the tax that is required to reduce energy demand and consequently CO2 emissions. The long-run elasticities assumed in the EC bottom-up study [COHERENCE (29)] vary among countries and range from --0.4 for France and the United Kingdom to -1.0 for Belgium; the short-run elasticities range from --0.1 to --0.25 for the same countries. These differences account for part of the national differences; evidence for elasticities especially in EC countries is discussed in Mors (96) and Pearson & Smith (97).In the global models, assumed long-run elasticities range from (--)0.3-0.4 for the Manne & Richels US and Global 2100 studies, to (--)0.6-1.0 for the OECD's GREEN model;15 short-run elasticities are about one-tenth this value. The OECD values were chosen after an extensive literature search (43, 64). For the United States, Jorgenson & Wilcoxen (73) estimate -0.15; Barrett (98) and Capros et al (99) discuss elasticities in the European context.The notion of elasticities assumes a symmetric response to price changes; if prices rise and then fall back to previous levels, the energy-intensity will (after allowing for lags) return to former levels. As noted below (Section 7.2), this basic assumption, and the values assumed for modeling, are disputed and have been particularly called into question by recent trends and studies.Technology Developments and CostsAssumptions concerning the cost and rate of implementation of more efficient or lower carbon technologies affect both baseline emissions and relative abatement costs. The initial Manne & Richels results for the United States (38) were strongly criticized by Williams (100) as being based on unreasonably pessimistic assumptions for efficiency improvements and the costs of alternative supply technologies. In response, Manne & Richels (94) examine three different background scenarios, which they termed technology optimistic, technology intermediate, and technology pessimistic. The last of these corresponds to their initial famous estimate that CO2 abatement could cost the US $3.6 trillion over the next century, and yields some of the higher cost points on Figures 6 and 8 above. Assumptions for the first, "technology optimistic," reduced these total costs by a factor of 20 for the (fixed) abatement target set, because of the combined impact on baseline emissions (primarily from the higher AEEI) and the halved costs for "backstop" low-carbon supply technologies. As a result, Manne & Riehels noted that "the direct economic losses are quite sensitive to assumptions about both demand and supply... for the losses [from carbon constraints to approach zero, however, the most optimistic combination of supply and demand assumptions must be adopted".This confirms that results are very sensitive to the assumptions concerning technology costs, again a result noted in the sensitivity study by Edmonds & Barns (81). Almost all studies fix the costs of supply technologies as exogenous data; Anderson & Bird (45) is the only study in which technology costs decline with increasing investment.Energy Sector Impact on GNPThe impact of changes in energy demand and energy sector costs on GNP is complex. General economy models capture the relationship consistently, but the resulting elasticity can still vary considerably. For example, the Global 2100 modeling approach (and by implication, the CRTM and CETA models also) contains a "nested CES" (constant elasticity of substitution) production function16 to relate energy input to economic output. Cline (17, Chapter 4) criticizes the parameters chosen, claiming that they yield an excessive impact of energy sector changes on GNP--a claim disputed by Manne & Richels.17For sectoral or partial equilibrium models, the impact of energy sector costs or carbon taxes on GNP may be estimated (if at all) by a direct elasticity ("GNP feedback") parameter, as available in the ERB model. Such studies have been criticized for overestimating the feedback and consequently overestimating the cost of reducing CO2; as noted in Section 5.3 above, Edmonds & Barns (81) recognize this limitation and suggest the use of consumer plus producer surplus changes as the best method of computing cost for the ERB model.Interfuel Substitution ElasticitiesSubstantial CO2 reduction can he achieved by switching towards less carbon-intensive fuels. In models with a purely engineering approach to supply this is captured by supply technology costs; for models with econo-metric supply modeling, it is governed by the interfuel substitution elasticity. GREEN assumes a long-run interfuel elasticity in production of 2.0 and a short-run value (reflecting existing supply infrastructure) of 0.5. Halving these values lowered global baseline emissions by 13% in 2050; the impact on abatement costs may be expected to be much larger unless the bulk of substitution is governed by backstop technologies.KEY DETERMINANTS: TECHNOLOGICAL VS ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVESIntroductionWe have explored the range of reported results on the costs of limiting CO2, and the technical modeling and data issues that affect such estimates. We now turn to a deeper analysis of the issues that determine abatement costs and the more credible results. This section examines the gulf that may be characterized (not always accurately) as that between "technology-engineering" and "economic" perspectives, in terms of assumptions concerning energy demand and policy, structural, and technological assumptions. The subsequent section examines how the abatement strategy and scope of analysis affect the reported results.It would be facile to suppose that the differences between "economic" and "engineering" views are confined to a few modeling parameters. They reflect very different perspectives, almost paradigms, about driving forces in the energy economy. A report from a UNEP workshop that sought to bridge the divide (101) observed that:      To economists, energy is a factor of production: it is an input into economic growth, and one which can substitute for labor or capital, depending on relative prices. While energy-efficiency may improve due to technical development, so does that of other factor inputs; and efficiency improvements lower the relative price or energy, increasing the extent to which it may be applied. Also, fossil fuels dominate because of demonstrable convenience and how cost. Thus whilst recognizing the potential importance of technical improvements, and even market imperfections which prevent optimal energy use, to most economists there is every reason to expect energy consumption to grow with expanding (GNP, and no particular reason to expect technical developments to reduce CO2 emissions relative to the business-as-usual case without incurring substantial costs It is a compelling case, with much long-term historical weight behind it.      To scientists and engineers, on the other hand, energy is not an abstract input but a physical means to particular ends. The applications which consume much energy are those of heating, heavy construction, metals, etc--basic infrastructure and comfort--and travel. In developed economies, most infrastructure needs have been met, travel may be approaching limits of congestion and time budgets, and much new economic activity is in areas which consume trivial amounts of energy, such as information technology, general entertainments, etc. Thus to most scientists and engineers economic growth is becoming less and less relevant to energy needs [in developed economies]. In addition, very large technical improvements in efficiency, which need not incur much extra costs, are readily demonstrable; technology is powerful and adaptable to changing conditions (such as requirement for nonfossil sources): and it is hard to believe that human society is incapable of finding ways of putting such options into effect (this applies primarily to developed economies, but may also be of great relevance to developing ones if they can move directly to advanced technologies). This too appears to be a strong case. with at least partial support from recent trends, but it leads to a very different outlook from the "economist's" outlook sketched above.This shows that the different perspectives lead to widely different assumptions concerning several factors: the relationship between energy demand and future economic growth in the absence of any abatement measures; the scope for exploiting more efficient technologies: and the scope for developing new technologies as needs (such as CO2 reduction) require. The rest of the section looks at each of these aspects.Baseline Energy Debated and the AEEISection 6 notes that energy demand in the absence of abatement measures depends on GNP (population times per capita GNP) growth rates, energy prices, and the response of demand to these. and the parameter usually translated as the rate of "autonomous end-use energy-intensity improvement" (AEEI). The impact of GNP and energy price changes is recognized by all analysts, as are the uncertainties. The major contrast in views arises from the differing assumptions about the AEEI. The enormous impact of this parameter has been noted in Section 6.2. Dean & Hoeller (64) state that "unfortunately there is relatively little backing in the economic literature for specific values of the AEEI ... the inability to tie it down to a much narrower range ... is a severe handicap, an uncertainty which needs to be recognized".Among the major global and US studies, Whalley & Wigle (36, 37) and Manne & Richels (38, 39) adopt the lowest values for AEEI (0 and around 0.5 respectively). Williams (100) strongly criticized such values as too low; Manne & Richels (40) defend their value of AEEI on the grounds that it appears consistent with observed trends in the United States. However, it is difficult to separate the various factors in their analysis (e.g. price, income distribution, and time sampling effects), and Wilson & Swisher (70) strongly dispute their interpretation, concluding that "one can produce an experiment that justifies whatever AEEI one likes within very broad ranges".We cannot suggest a definite value for this parameter, but it is important to understand it. The parameter has been badly misnamed: it is a measure of all nonprice-induced changes in gross energy-intensity--which may be neither autonomous, nor concern energy-efficiency alone. It is not simply a measure of technical progress, for it conflates at least three different factors. One indeed is technical developmentsthat increase energy productivity. But another is structural changei.e. shifts in the mix of economic activities (which may require widely different amounts of energy per unit value added). The third is policy-driven uptake of more efficient technologies,due to regulatory (as opposed to price) changes, greater than would occur without those changes.Technical change is indeed hard to predict. Studies by Meyers & Schipper (102, 103) suggest that in manufacturing alone, technical change has increased energy productivity in OECD countries by about 2% per year for at least the past two decades; this includes price effects, but in fact there is no clear change in the trend that correlates with the energy price shocks (perhaps because of the lags in manufacturing equipment). Technical change appears more closely related to the price shocks in other sectors.Structural change encompasses the phenomena of saturation in energy-intensive activities (such as home heating and primary heavy industries), and shifts towards less energy-intensive activities. A range of studies have noted that structural change, both between sectors and within manufacturing industry, has played an important part in restraining energy demand in the OECD in the past 20 years (103). Williams et al (104) provide considerable evidence for expecting the observed trend in manufacturing to continue. On the basis of this and other relevant literature, and various saturation effects, Grubb (79, Chapter 6) argues that an autonomous structural trend towards lower energy-intensities (i.e. rising AEEI) is to be expected as countries develop and as economic growth moves towards increasingly refined products and services.We tentatively suggest that the lower values of AEEI in long-term studies (significantly below 1.0 especially for OECD countries) are dubious because of saturation and structural change effects. If correct, this points to baseline emissions towards the lower end of the range of long-run model predictions, making any fixed target much easier to reach and also reducing the scale and hence relative costs of reductions. This is, however, tentative; there are substantial uncertainties and a clear need for greater understanding of technical and structural trends, and integration of such studies in abatement cost modeling.The AEEI is not the only controversial issue surrounding the relationship between CNP and energy demand. As noted in Section 6.4, considerable uncertainty surrounds estimates of the price elasticity of energy demand. Most studies have sought to estimate elasticities from the response of demand to the energy price rises of the 1970s and early 1980s. More recent trends, if anything, increase the uncertainties. Although energy demand has started to rise again in OECD countries following the price fails since the mid-1980s, the response has not been nearly as great as predicted by the simple reversible statistics of elasticity. Engineers have long maintained that the efficiency gains would not be lost, because they are embodied in better knowledge and techniques that will not be abandoned even if energy prices fall. The recent trends at least partially support this view, and econometric studies (105) have now started to question the basis of constant elasticities that assume symmetric responses to price increases and fails. Weisacker (106) also emphasizes the importance of recent analysis of price responses, and shows how it could have substantial implications for longterm abatement costs and strategies.Regulatory Instruments and the Energy-Efficiency GapMost top-down models assume the optimal operation of markets in response to observes price signals (Section 5.1). in which case economic theory suggests taxes to be the optimal means of abatement. The observation of the large efficiency gap demonstrated by engineering studies (Section 3) calls this into question. Many economic discussions reject the relevance of this data; Nordhaus (30) for example states in his review that believing in such free lunches requires an act of faith that is not warranted by economic evidence.As discussed in Section 3.2, the "efficiency gap" comprises many different components. If it can he wholly explained in terms of lags in take-up, unavoidable hidden costs, etc. then it is a phenomenon of little direct relevance to the actual costs of limiting CO2 emissions. However, many barriers to the uptake of more efficient technologies have been identified; Reddy (107) gives an extensive and clear analysis of the different kinds of barriers, and Grubb (79, Chapter 4) notes at least eight different categories. The reality of unexploited opportunities is beyond doubt.It is accepted that some things can be done to improve the uptake of efficient techniques, for example, with government campaigns to improve information and the awareness of consumers of energy-efficiency and conservation. Most top-down studies in effect assume such measures to be enacted irrespective of CO2 abatement, and ignore or dispute the scope for other more direct cost-effective actions. However, experience and modeling studies of regulatory policies demonstrate that such measures can and have been effective. Examples include studies of the US National Appliance Standard and Car Efficiency (CAFE) standards [Rolin & Beyea (108)]; of US building standards [Norberg-Bohm (109), Bradley et al (67)]; and a variety of measures internationally reviewed in Johansson et al (31).Regulatory changes to encourage utility demand-side management programs have been widely advanced as a way of capturing the "free lunch" by getting utilities to invest in end-use efficiency. The "hidden costs" in such policies are debated. Joskow & Marron (110) conducted a survey of experience in US programs and concluded that "reported costs exceed those of the technology potential analysis because program costs are higher and energy savings are lower than these studies assume ... although many of the programmes still appear cost effective".The important fact remains that modeiling studies of specific regulatory options frequently yield lower, rather than higher, estimates of abatement costs than those derived from carbon taxation designed to achieve similar abatement. Such studies of regulatory measures thus contrast with the common economic assumption that regulatory options are more expensive than using economic incentives. This is because such policies address areas of significant market "failure".In terms of economic model parameters, this may also be understood in terms of the AEEI, for policy-driven changes is its third component. The critical question is not then just its value, but the extent to which it in fact is a variable that may be affected by policy.So how large is the potential "free lunch" of zero-cost energy-efficiency improvements captured by regulatory change? The end-use technology studies discussed in Section 3 frequently suggest a long-run technical potential to reduce energy demand without extra costs by 20-50%. Schipper et al (103) discuss the implementation and potential of energy-efficiency programs across the OECD in detail. They too conclude that there is large potential, but emphasize that the achievable potential will always be substantially smaller than the apparent technical potential, and that exploiting it will depend on more aggressive and sophisticated policies. Taking account of the various implementation issues points at best to the lower end of the 20-50% range being available--though we note that further technological development would also be expected.This, combined with the estimates of Schipper (103) and a range of other more sector-specific studies (such as the regulatory studies noted above) suggest that over a couple of decades, targeted energy-efficiency programs might reduce energy demand by up to 20% of the level projected in the absence of any such policies, at costs lower than that of the displaced supply. Cost-effective savings of 20% is also the figure adopted by Cline from his review of engineering studies (17, Chapter 5). Furthermore, even many topdown studies indicate that reductions of 10-20% may be available at very low cost. While acknowledging the many uncertainties, we consider 20% reductions to be a reasonable estimate of the credible size of the "free lunch."It is still debatable quite how this may be interpreted in relation to top-down studies. The US National Academy of Sciences study (47) compares bottom-up and top-down results, and highlights the large differences between the results up to moderate emission reductions, but also states there is a broad overlap at higher emissions; the "negative cost" of bottom-up studies corresponds to "low cost" in top-down studies, after which both approaches converge on rising marginal costs for further abatement.A different view is given by other comparisons of top-down and bottom-up results. A critique and comparison of data from economic modeling as summarized by Nordhaus (30), and their relationship to bottom-up results, is presented by Wilson & Swisher (70), who indicate that bottom-up studies suggest cheaper abatement right across the range. up to abatement of 70% or more. Their data suggest that the whole cost curve from the top-down studies reviewed by Nordhaus has to be shfted by 20-40% to reflect the technical opportunities identified by bottom-up studies, which would greatly alter the pattern shown in the graphs of Section 4.18In reality, the data from studies are too scattered to reach a definitive conclusion; the actual situation is likely to lie between these extremes, implying a need for some reduction in abatement costs from top-down models across the range to allow for the potential of regulatory-driven improvements in energy-efficiency. A further factor is that, with expanded markets for more energy-efficient technologies, these technologies might develop faster, thus permanently raising the AEEI. The impact of such a change has already been noted.Technology Assumptions and ModelingUltimately, the costs of limiting CO2 emissions will depend heavily on the technologies available, not only technologies for more efficient use or energy, but also for the production, conversion, and utilization of lower-carbon energy sources. The importance of technology, as well as assumptions concerning its developments and costs, has been widely acknowledged: it forms the central element of Williams's (100) critique of the Manne & Richels (38) conclusions, and sensitivity studies by Manne & Richels (40) and Edmonds & Barns (81) have demonstrated that estimates of abatement costs depend crucially on technology assumptions.Yet the care with which such assumptions have been developed varies widely, and the models employed to date have limited representation of technology issues. Models that do incorporate some explicit representation of technology include the Global 2100 model and its derivatives (CRTM and CETA), more recent variants of the OECD GREEN model, and the ERB model, which has a fuller representation of technology in compensation for its weaker macroeconomic linkages. Sensitivity studies with all these models illustrate the crucial importance of technological assumptions.To establish reasonable assumptions, it is pertinent to start with current data, and visible trends and options. With respect to supply-side options, data such as that collated and summarized in many publications [e.g. Refs. 18- 22] for review of sources see UNEP (16)] illustrates the immense range of possibilities. They span technologies that are proven and largely mature (such as combined-cycle gas turbines CCGTs), proven but still developing (such as wind energy and higher-efficiency clean coal conversion), confidently predicted [such as much cheaper photovoltaics (PV) systems and integrated biomass gasification], to a wide variety of lesser or more speculative options. Most recently, an immense study of the prospects for modernized renewable energy technologies (111) argued that these could meet about half global energy demand by the middle of the next century at little if any additional cost; the studies of wind energy in this volume estimated that the costs of modern wind turbines were already almost competitive against coal power stations for large-scale exploitation in countries such as the United States with extensive wind energy resources. None of the CO2 abatement models contain explicit representation of wind energy technology, and for large countries such as the United States and the former Soviet Union, this alone might substantially lower abatement cost estimates.No models can capture the full range of options available; by inevitably excluding some, there can be an in-built tendency to overestimate abatement costs (unless this is offset by using over-optimistic assumptions concerning those that are included). Some abatement studies use data already being rendered obsolete as options already identified for cost reductions are exploited. Williams (100) provides one of the most detailed critiques of the technological assumptions used in the Manne & Richels base case assumptions and their derivatives, and argues that many of the assumed costs are higher than can already be predicted with confidence.This leads naturally to the issue of technology development and cost reductions. This is uncertain terrain. but not a complete black box. Technologies do not arise, improve, and penetrate markets at random, especially for large and complex technologies such as those involved in energy provision. Technology development follows market demand, with the associated public and private R&D investment and learning processes as technologies develop towards market maturity. Yet despite this well-attested and understood fact, almost all the abatement costing studies to date model technology development as "exogenous"--the costs of abatement technologies are defined as input data and do not vary explicitly with the level of investment, incentives, and market penetration in the model. That alone must be considered as a severe limitation.Anderson & Bird (45) provide one of the few abatement cost analyses to date that explicitly includes production scale economies. They apply this to renewable technologies within a simple investment/growth model of global economic expansion. Their analysis produces lower cost estimates than most of the more complex studies that model the economy and energy sector in more detail, but wholly neglect the issue of technology development.A very different approach to the issue of endogenous technological development is that by Hogan & Jorgenson (93) . This econometric study related changes in productivity trends (which are equated with technical progress), in different sectors of the US economy, to price changes in the different inputs. Although energy productivity did improve when energy prices rose, this was more than offset by reduced productivity growth in other factor inputs at the same thile. They found that overall. "technology change has been negatively correlated with energy prices . . . if energy prices increase, the rate of productivity growth will decrease." However, such results may be very sensitive to the model specification, and as argued in Grubb (79, Chapter 3), the transition from "has been" to "will" in this excerpt conceals the importance of innumerable extraneous factors in the years analyzed, most notably the macro-economic impact of the sudden and externally imposed oil price shocks. It is highly debatable whether the data reveal anything useful about the economy-wide and long-term technological impact of smoother price changes arising from domestic policies such as carbon taxes, and other abatement policies .The potential for substantial cost reductions associated with larger-scale deployment of low CO2 technologies, combined with the observations above about possible irreversibilities in the impact of price changes, points to the possibility that there may be various choices of technological trajectories differing little in cost. One is to continue along a carbon-intensive path. Another is to invest enough to alter the course of new investments over the next decade or two towards more efficient, and low-carbon, technologies. As investment patterns and institutions and infrastructures adapt to these new technologies. their costs will fall, perhaps until they become the naturally preferred options. The world would be on a different technological trajectory. Although the transition may be costly, especially if it is forced rapidly, given the nature of technology development and economies of scale it cannot be assumed that this would be a much more costly long-term path (147).This is an example of the issue of "bifurcation," identified especially by Hourcade (112) as a concept that "encompasses many network industries where market forces tend, beyond a bifurcation point, to reinforce the first choice ... in a self-fulfilling process." Hourcade highlights that this is not only a matter of scale economies; once investment is made in transport infrastructure or town planning, for example, it attracts a major network of other investments that reinforce the original choice and make later changes much more costly than if development occured along a different trajectory. Hourcade develops a technology-oriented economic model and projects various scenarios that differ by up to 50% in long-run CO2 emissions for the same estimated costs.The prospects for technology development, production scale economies, and exploitation of bifurcations to lower emissions suggest that the cost estimates in many economic studies are implausibly high. Indeed, some use data that appear to indicate costs higher than those of some currently identified technologies, and make little or no allowance for future technical improvements especially in nonfossil sources.We do, however, note that there are considerable constraints on the rate at which such technologies could be developed and deployed; as modeled most clearly by Anderson & Bird (45), the deployment of major new supply technologies will take many decades.On these grounds we consider the higher long-term (beyond c.2025) costs illustrated on the graphs in Section 4 to be relatively implausible.KEY DETERMINANTS: ABATEMENT STRATEGIES AND SCOPE OF ANALYSISEven when issues relating to technology costs and deployment are put on a comparable basis, there are many other important sources of difference among economic modeling studies arising from the form of abatement strategy and the scope of analysis. In this section we examine the most important of these.Subsidies, Tax Forms, and the Use of Tar RevenuesVarious forms of taxes (and subsidies) can be used to limit emissions. Different types of taxes lead to different reductions in C02 and to different impacts on the economy [Scheraga & Leary (113)]. Most of the economic models considered assume abatement to be achieved by a carbon tax, imposed on the carbon content of primary fuels. However, taxes could be applied to subsets of fuels, downstream on derived fuel products, or otherwise not in proportion to carbon content of fuels, e. g. on gasoline only or on the energy content of fuels . This generally results in greater economic costs (lower tax efficiency). Thus, a gasoline tax is less efficient than a carbon tax at reducing carbon omissions (95); and taxes on electricity production are much less efficient than a tax on input fuels; the latter do not encourage fuel switching, only reducing CO2 by depressing demand for electricity (114).The distributional effects between countries vary greatly according to whether the tax is imposed by producers or by the consuming countries [Whalley & Wigle (37)]. Carbon/energy taxes also have substantial distributional effects within countries, as they frequently have greater impact on the poor and always have greater impacts on energy-producing sectors. Distributional impacts can often be offset by accompanying measures that redistribute some of the revenue back to those adversely affected.Of greater relevance to the assessment of total abatement costs is that energy production in most countries is subject to a complex set of taxes and subsidies, and abatement costs inevitably depend on the existing tax structure. Where heavy taxes are already imposed (as with oil products in many OECD countries), the macro-economic impact of additional taxation is likely to be greater than in the absence of existing taxation; conversely, where energy is subsidized, removal of subsidies (or equivalent taxation) will often yield macro-economic benefits. Many models ignore initial subsidies and taxes.The OECD (115, 116) and the World Bank (117) identify a range of energy subsidies, widespread outside the OECD but also widely applied to coal in OECD countries. These subsidies amount to an estimated $235 billion, equating to a carbon subsidy of $92 per ton outside the OECD and indicating a significant potential for limiting emissions at net economic benefits by removing subsidies. These figures are dominated by the former Soviet Union ($160 billion), which is anyway undergoing radical price reform, but the potential impact in countries such as India and China is clearly important. however, in such countries the distributional impact of removing subsidies is especially severe because of the poverty and lack of any social security protection; social impacts and political constraints are central in practical considerations. We also note that structures of subsidies and taxes are not arbitrary; oil taxes in OECD countries, for example, reflect perceived external costs associated with dependence on foreign oil.Where net taxes are applied, the impact on GNP depends on how the revenues generated are used. Yamaji (118) assumed that the carbon tax revenue left the Japanese economy, likening an imposition of a carbon tax to the oil price shocks of the 1970s. The resulting estimates of the impact on GNP (a 5% loss) are much larger than if most of the revenue were kept within the economy. The US Congressional Budget Office (78) compared the effect of a revenue-raising tax (which removes money from the economy to reduce the federal budget deficit) with a fiscally neutral carbon tax, and found the impact on GNP to be much lower in the latter caseThe short-term CBO studies (78) have since been complemented with more broad-ranging and longer-term studies of tax-recycling issues, notably Bradley et al (67), Brinner et al ( 120), Scheraga & Leary (113), the European Commission ( 121), and Shackleton et al (76), which show evidence that while initially depressed, GNP could be raised in the long term by some recycling strategies These papers explore the implications of a variety of tax recycling options Table 7 illustrates key results, qualitatively because of the uncertainties in these (mostly shorten macro-economic) models, and the extent to which the impacts vary over time, as discussed in Section 5.2 Figure 13 shows the results of two alternative tax recycling options (lumpsum rebate and investment tax credit) for four different models as compared by Shackleton et al (76)If the tax revenues are taken out of the economy (e.g. unaccounted for or spent abroad), all impacts on the national economy are negative. For other uses of the tax revenues, different macro-economic indices frequently move in different directions. For the carbon tax levels considered (up to about $80 per ton C), nearly all these studies find some ways in which the net effect is to boost GNP, as compared to a projection in which existing tax structures are unchanged.These results reflect at least two different factors. First, a carbon tax raises money largely from consumption; this may be transferred to qualitatively different economic activities. If the reverse are used to stimulate investment directly, this reduces consumption but soon increases GNP. If the revenues are used to reduce budget deficits, consumption and GNP are initially depressed but they may slowly recover as the lower interest rates etc improve the investment climate; Brinner et al (120) suggest that the GNP impact in the United States becomes positive within 15 years, although EC studies suggest a slower recovery. Conversely, if the revenues are used to boost consumption, investment is diminished and shortly thereafter GNP growth. It is doubtful the extent to which the gains or losses should really be credited to CO2 reduction, since they partly reflect a channeling of resources from one kind of economic activity to another. We do not therefore consider the extreme points in Figure 9 especially. which reflect such transfers, to be of great relevance. More neutral schemes of tax recycling, for example associated with value-added tax (VAT) offsets or reduced social security contributions. are more directly relevant. As indicated in the table. models differ with respect to the sign of associated GNP (and employment) impacts, but mostly show the impacts to be relatively small.This reflects the second element, which is that carbon taxes at the levels considered may be genuinely less distortionary than the most distortionary existing taxes. There is still some debate as to how valid it is to count such changes as a credit for carbon taxation. As with the efficiency "free lunch" debate, should not governments make the current tax structures optimal irrespective of abatement efforts, with gains that should not be credited to carbon taxation? There are no easy answers to this. Certainly it is to be hoped that tax structures become more optimal over time. But there are also real constraints on taxation policy, and objectives other than just efficiency; Hourcade (112) notes growing political and trade constraints on traditional taxes and concludes that "it is timely to consider the taxation of 'bads' (such as pollution) as an answer to the general problem or raising revenues." In any case, if carbon taxes represent an efficient way of limiting emissions, it would be perverse to say that the revenues should not be used in the most desirable way--or alternatively, to say that economists should not model reality because the starting point is not optimal.For longer-term assessment, current quirks of taxation systems may be less significant, but it is still important to recognize that governments need to raise revenues; carbon taxes will reduce the revenue required from other taxes and models need to reflect this reality. In general, the distortionary impact of a tax increases nonlinearly with its level, so it is efficient to spread the tax base as broadly as possible. Consequently, even in the absence of a CO2 problem, the optimal level or energy/carbon taxation would not be zero.Consequently we can conclude that modeling studies that neglect such distortions in the rest of the tax system--and the consequent potential gains from carbon tax recycling--tend to overestimate the GNP impact of carbon taxation, this includes all the long-run (post 2010) points in the graphs in Section 4, and many of the shorter-term studies as well, where the practical GNP gains may be more significant.Scope of Abatement, Trade, and LeakageClimate change is a global problem, and the more countries that take part in abatement, the lower the costs of limiting global emissions will be. Studies emphasize that action by industrialized countries may have a significant short-term impact, but that the costs of restraining global emissions rise rapidly if developing countries are not soon included. Furthermore, even if all the major countries participate, the costs are greater if each is bound to fixed emission targets, because some regions may then incur much higher costs than others as noted by e.g. Edmonds et al (68).Table 8 shows one estimate of the impact of allowing countries freedom to choose where to invest to limit emissions (i.e. trade in emission commitments). Despite a no-trade case that involves similar rate of emissions reduction below baseline (2% per year), there are still significant differences in marginal abatement costs (reflected in the tax rate) between regions, and thus savings (of 10-45%) to be made from trading. Less uniform (relative to baseline) initial commitments would increase the benefits of trading accordingly; an extreme case was a special run of the Whalley-Wigle model (36, 37) that showed that the costs of obtaining the same degree of abatement, but with equal per capita emissions globally, would be roughly twice the costs of achieving the same reductions if emissions trading is allowed. Clearly models that do not allow such trade will report costs greater than necessary.A related issue is that of "leakage." Emission constraints in some countries may lower traded fuel prices and change terms of trade in away that increases in CO2 emissions in non-abating regions. Early studies with the Rutherford model (CRTM, 41) suggested this could be a large effect, but more recent studies have decreased such estimates. The OECD GREEN (90) and ERB (68) models identify leakage rates from OECD action at only a few per cent, while noting that it is sensitive to the assumed coal supply elasticities, and that not all aspects of leakage are captured by the model.As countries move towards considering energy and carbon taxes, there is bound to be more focus on trade-related aspects and the way they may affect national abatement costs and impacts. Research in this area is still in early stages, but a preliminary analysis and discussion is given by Horton et al (123), and a substantial review of the issues and models (including many covered in this paper) is given by Pezzy (124).Rate and Pattern of Emissions AbatementMost studies--including those reviewed--have focused on measuring costs for a given degree of emissions abatement. It is clear that the costs must also depend on the rate of abatement. This is partly because relatively "slow" abatement can be achieved by introducing lower carbon technologies as older vintages are naturally retired. Figure 14 illustrates this, by comparing results of the GREEN model before and after it was extended to include semi-putty vintage modeling, which reflects the additional costs of being forced to retire capital stock prematurely. The modeling improvement has little effect on the costs of CO2 abatement at a rate of 1% per year below the baseline trend, but for abatement at a rate of 3% per year below the baseline trend, the costs are very much higher when the stock effect is included .In reality, many other factors also make more rapid abatement more costly. A variety of macro-economic disequilibria come into play capital or labor cannot move rapidly from one sector to another, in response to relative price and other changes. Since resource allocation/equilibrium models do not capture these effects, they tend (other things being equal) to underestimate the costs of rapid abatement; unlike most other factors noted, this suggests that most of the points in Figures 6-8--most of which are derived from resource- allocation models-- underestimate costs in this respect, especially for more rapid (shorter-term and more extreme) abatement.The observation above that short-run macro-economic models indicate a much smaller response of emissions to a given level of carbon tax is another indication that such models show the economy to be more resistant to change than do equilibrium models such as GREEN. The real dependence of costs on the rate of abatement may thus be even greater than suggested by the GREEN results in figure 14. A plot on the data from modeling studies presented in Section 4 against the rate of abatement (not reproduced here) does not, however, reveal a particularly strong relationship. We suggest that this is because the results are mostly from equilibrium models, which themselves have a wide variety of capital stock modeling (if any). Few studies with short-run macro-economic models have been carried out. and these focus on different ways of recycling carbon tax revenues; the issue of how costs vary with the rate of abatement does not seem to have been examined methodically with macro models.A third issue relating directly to the rate of abatement is that of technology development and diffusion. This is inherently a process that takes time, particularly in energy supply. Marchetti and others at IIASA (125) proposed a general principle that it takes around 50 years for a new supply technology to become dominant. More detailed technology studies reveal a more complex picture, with the notes of diffusion dependent on the nature of the technology and existing infrastructure; Grubb & Walker (126) argue that electricity supply could change much more rapidly than the "50 years" rules implies, but that fundamental changes to non-carbon transport fuels could be still slower.Clearly, long timescales are involved, and these estimates do not include timescales for basic research and development. Consequently, rapid reductions will have to use less developed technologies than will slower reductions. This observation has been interpreted as a way of saying that delayed reductions are cheaper, but the implication rather is that costs will be minimized by setting the process of transition in motion as early as possible, because that will give the maximum time in which to develop, deploy, and refine lower carbon technologies. For a given total emissions over the next century, for example, simply delaying initial abatement efforts would both delay the start of such a transition and increase the rate and degree of abatement that would ultimately have to be pursued.In this context we note the relevance of the whole pattern of abatement imposed in abatement costing studies. The ultimate objective is to reduce accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere. Studies that impose a set time-path of emissions make no attempt to explore possible less costly emission paths to the same end. The original Manne-Richels studies for example show carbon taxes rising to more than $650 per ton C, settling back down to a level of $250 per ton C set by the "backstop technology." Peck & Tiesberg (42) point out that this is clearly not "efficient"; greater long-run abatement can be achieved with less long-run GNP impact by a time path that involves steadily rising carbon taxes. A more efficient time path of abatement would thus lower the (GNP impact of studies shown in Figures 6-9. By how much is difficult to say indeed, there are so many issues inadequately addressee in this context (e.g. concerning technology development and diffusion) that firm conclusions would be premature but it is an important area for further exploration .Externalities and Multi-criteria AssessmentCO2 is but one of many external impacts associated with energy. other pollutants are produced and other issues ranging from energy security to road congestion are important but not included in traditional economic studies. Attempts to quantify other externalities [e.g. Hohmeyer (127); Ottinger et al (128)] suggest these can be significant. A study by Glomsrod et al for Norway (129) appears to be the only one that includes the reduction of these other impacts as quantified "side-benefits" in a study of CO2 abatement. This and a review by Pearce (130) suggest that including these "secondary benefits" can alter cost assessments radically.One aspect of such conclusions--in common with those relating to the "efficiency gap" subsidies and carbon tax recycling--is the potential for net economic gains from abatement efforts that reduce current market imperfections. Where the gains from reducing other externalities are so large it would make sense to address the them directly (in many countries this is already happening); once this is done. the further incidental benefits of CO2 control would be much reduced. Nevertheless, it is also important that modeling studies reflect the actual situation, including current external costs associated with energy supply which CO2 abatement would also help to address. Again the consequence is that the costs displayed in Figures 6-9, which ignore such external benefits of CO2 control should be lowered according to the value accorded to the avoided externalities.It should also be recognized that externalities may operate to increase the cost of emissions reductions. For example, large hydropower schemes may offer very cheap power for a region and produce no CO2. But they have many other impacts. Whether or not hydro schemes are actually desirable is a complex political judgment about different sorts of costs and benefits including land-use and ecological impact. All this points to the fact that many criteria other than economic cost need to be factored in to any comprehensive analysis of CO2 abatement. Like much else in the analysis of abatement costs and strategies it is not a choice that can be dictated by economic analysis alone.CONCLUSIONSOne survey and analysis of the literature on fossil-fuel CO2 abatement costing shows a very wide spread of reported results and the analysis reveals many different features that explain these differences.General Conclusions1. Estimates of the costs of limiting fossil-fuel CO2 emissions span a very wide range. The principal factors that affect estimates are as follows.A. The choice of modeling approach and focus notably:    * top-down or bottom-up;    * associated regulatory modeling;    * short-run macro-economic or long-run equilibrium;    * the linkage between energy sector in impacts and GNP;    * modeling of technology development in response to incentives.B. The numerical assumptions concerning:    * energy-GNP trends as governed by income elasticities and autonomous energy-intensity improvements:    * fossil-fuel reserves and associated future prices and supply elasticities:    * the degree (elasticity) and reversibility of energy demand responses to price changes:    * technology development and costs (including production scale economies), or equivalent substitution elasticities.C. The nature of the abatement strategy and the scope of analysis:    * the reflection of existing tax and subsidy distortions and associated use of carbon tax revenues;    * the scope of abatement and allowance for emissions trade among participants;    * the rate and pattern of emissions abatement:    * the extent to which external costs atoll benefits associated with energy supply are reflected.II. "Bottom-up" engineering models tend to underestimate costs by neglecting issues of implementation and other hidden costs. "Top-down" economic models tend to overestimate costs by neglecting the potential for enhancing structural change and energy-efficiency gains through regulatory policy. We suggest that real "cost-free" reductions of up to 20% below the baseline projection over a couple of decades is a reasonable estimate of this potential, but realizing such reductions will require extensive implementation of policy instruments to improve market efficiencies.III. Within the range of abatement issues and options, there are at least four kinds of options that reduce CO2 emissions but may incur macro-economic gains: regulatory policies to reduce the "efficiency gap" as noted above; removal of subsidies for carbon focus; use of carbon tax revenues to reduce existing tax distortions: and the reduction of high non- CO2 externalities. In each case the possibilities raise similar questions about the extent to which the benefits of associated policy reform should be credited to CO2 abatement. In each case we conclude that some credit is justified, but that not all the potential should be credited as benefits of CO2 abatement.IV. There is a need for much more extensive economic research on the issues identified above. Our review also illustrates the importance of conducting sensitivity studies with respect to the assumptions embodied in cost modeling studies, and of presenting these assumptions with clarity. More careful consideration of the use of GNP as an indicator of welfare, and study of complementary and alternative indicators, is also required.QuaQuantitive ConclusionsFor comparative cost purposes, it is useful to express abatement relative to a baseline projection of expected emissions in the absence of specific abatement efforts. More attention needs to be devoted to definition of the baseline case. However, in general, we conclude the following.V. Short-run abatement costs. The results for regional and shorter-term studies of abatement costs vary very widely: the reported costs of emission reductions of 15-40% below baseline (not base year) over the next 15-20 years, for example, range from GNP gains of more than 1% to a several percent loss in GNP.However, the higher losses in this range reflect the fiscal effect of removing carbon tax revenues from the economy, and also ignore the potential for energy-efficiency programs; while the larger GNP gains either reflect the use of carbon taxes to transfer resources from consumption to investment or reflect pure technology potentials. These extremes are of questionable relevance as measures of abatement costs, which in reality may be expected to lie well within these outlier values.VI. Long-run abatement costs. The range in long-run cost estimates is not quite so broad. With low exceptions, long-run modeling results portray that reducing CO2 emissions at a rate averaging up to 2% per year below baseline, leading to a halving of relative emissions by the middle of the next century, may reduce the associated long-run global GNP by up to 3%with the lower bound of costs being almost negligible.VII. For most (but not all) of the issues listed in (I) above, using more realistic or plausible assumptions reduces abatement cost estimates as compared with the most widely reported top-down economic modeling studies. The evidence presented front sensitivity studies and other modeling studies suggests that reasonable allowance for technology development, removal of subsidies and recycling of carbon tax revenues, and the reflection of avoided externalities alone might halve the more pessimistic estimates of abatement costs. Consequently, we suggest that a realistic range for the GNP loss from halving long-run CO2 emissions (relative to the emissions in most "baseline" projections) is 0-1.5%.The upper bound of this range is large in absolute termsVIII. Costs will depend heavily on the rate at which abatement is imposed. The conclusions cited above refer to moderate rates of abatement. Study of this issue is seriously inadequate, but the costs may start to rise sharply for abatement at rates exceeding 1-2% per year below the baseline trend.IX. To put these in context, we note that projections by the World Energy Council (131) and many others suggest that global CO2 emissions in the absence of CO2 abatement policies or other policy changes that significantly restrain CO2 emissions, may grow at a rate averaging 1.6% per year (+-0.4% per year) for many decades.19 Given all the uncertainties and possibilities for lower abatement costs identified in this paper, our survey and analysis therefore suggests that keeping long-term global CO2 emissions to about current levels--which is much more severe than current proposals to stabilize emissions in industrialized countries-may if carried out in an efficient manner be expected to reduce global GNP towards the middle of the next century by no more than 1-1.5%, and average GNP growth rates over the period by less than 0.02-0.03% per year.Consequently we suggest that the real difficulties of abatement lie in the design and implementation of nationally and globally efficient policies, and thc geographical, sectoral. and social distribution of abatement impacts. Many analytic issues remain to be resolved, but for constraining CO2 emissions, the key problems appear to be not massive, macro-economic losses, but rather the politics of implementation, winners, and losers.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/mva/iamcc.tg/articles/Jain-doc/Jain.html <TEXT>INTRODUCTIONPast measurements show that greenhouse gas concentrations, many of which are affected by human related activities, are increasing in the atmosphere. There is wide consensus that this increase influences the earth's energy balance and concern that this will cause significant change in climate.1,2 Many different policies could be adopted in response to the prospects of greenhouse warming. Models are used by policy makers to analyze the range of possible policy options developed as a response to concerns about climate change. A fully integrated assessment model that spans the many aspects of climate change, including economics, energy options, effects of climate, and impacts of climate change, would be a useful tool. With this goal in mind, the science modules which estimate the effect of emissions of greenhouse gasses on global temperature and sea level are being developed. This is a report of the current characteristics and performance of an Integrated Science Model which consists of coupled modules for carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry of other trace gases, radiative forcing by greenhouse gases, energy balance model for global temperature, and a model for sea level response.Integrated assessment models should not only help to identify the relevant questions, but should also serve to structure the research results and thus facilitate clear communication between the scientists and policy makers. The process of global climate change and its possible ecological, economic and social impacts involves interactions between physical, ecological, economic and social systems. Research efforts can be divided into three broad areas: the relation between emissions and climate; the relation between climate and impacts; and the relation of policy and economics to emissions and impacts. This report addresses the first of these three.Currently, only simplified models are used to analyze the large number of emission reduction scenarios required as part of the policy-making process. At present there are five such simplified models that attempt to relate emissions to climate change which are intended for use in an integrated assessment model: the Muenster Climate Model (MCM) developed by Vain and Bach3; the AMAC model developed by Prather4 for EPA; IMAGE model developed by Rotmans et al.5; STUGE developed by Wigley et al.6; and ICAM developed by Dowlatabadi and Morgan7. The Integrated Science Model presented in this report incorporates the previous lessons of these earlier models, while improving the modules for carbon cycle and atmospheric chemistry of other trace gases. Improvements in the understanding of these processes are discussed in the IPCC 1994 Report on Radiative Forcing of Climate. This model is used to estimate the relation between the time-dependent rate of greenhouse gas emissions and quantitative features of climate--global temperature, the rate of temperature change, and sea level--that are thought to be indicators of human impact on climate and ecosystems. Notwithstanding, there remains significant uncertainty in the modeled relation between emissions and climate.MODELING APPROACHFig. 1 shows the coupled model concept employed. The model consists of several sub-models converting emissions of major greenhouse gases to concentrations, an energy balance climate model for the atmosphere and the ocean, and a sea level rise model. These are linked in a simple way: the output of one model serves as input for the next. The following greenhouse gases contributing to the additional man-made greenhouse effect are used as input: CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC-11, -12, -113, -114, -115, HCFC-22, Halon-1301, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3), and stratospheric water vapor. The greenhouse effect is modeled as a dynamic process with discrete time steps of one year and a simulation period of 335 years, i. e. from 1765 (the beginning of the industrial era) to 2100. The model runs to simulate the periods of 1765 to 1990 and 1990 to 2100 are based on estimates of historical mission data and specific future emission scenarios. Fig. 1 also shows which modules will be added to the existing model in the near future. Trace gases not included in this study, such as Ozone, other CFCs and Halons, are planned to be included in the future. Here we give only a brief overview of various coupled models.Concentration ModelsCO2. The concentration of CO2 is calculated by a newly developed globally averaged carbon cycle model which consists of four reservoirs, namely the atmosphere, the terrestrial biosphere, the mixed ocean layer, and the deep ocean. The atmosphere and the mixed layers are modeled as well mixed reservoirs. Transport of total inorganic carbon in the deep ocean is modeled by a partial differential equation, spanning time and ocean depth, which accounts for vertical diffusion and upwelling. The rate of transport in the deep ocean is dependent on two parameters: eddy diffusivity and upwelling velocity8. Water upwells through the deep ocean column to the surface ocean layer from where it is returned, through a polar sea, to the bottom of the ocean column thereby completing the thermohaline circulation. Air-sea exchange is modeled by an air sea exchange coefficient in combination with the buffer factor that summarizes the chemical re-equilibration of sea water with respect to CO2 variations. An additional source term is added to the model deep ocean to account for the oxidation of organic debris containing carbon removed in the surface ocean layer by photosynthesis and brought to the deep ocean by particulate settling. To estimate the flux of CO2 between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere, a multi-box, globally-aggregated, terrestrial-biosphere sub-model is coupled to the atmosphere box. The mass of the carbon contained in the different terrestrial reservoirs and the rate of exchange between them have been based on the analysis by Harvey.9 The photosynthetic rate of carbon fixation is modeled to increase logarithmically with atmospheric CO2 concentration and is proportional to a CO2 fertilization factor. The exchange coefficients between boxes contained in the terrestrial biosphere model are temperature dependent.CFCs HCFCs and N2O. The past and future atmospheric N2O, CFC-11, -12, -113, -114, -115, HCFC-22, Halon-1301, CCl4, and CH3CCl3 concentrations are calculated by a simple mass balance model described by Bach and Jain10. In this model, the annual concentrations of specific gasses are determined by their initial concentrations, and emission and removal rates. The removal rates of these gasses are assumed to be inversely proportional to their atmospheric lifetimes.The CFC content in the atmosphere is based on the amount that escapes into the atmosphere and is calculated directly from the amount produced. In this study the products of CFC-11 and CFC-12 are divided into four categories, namely, prompt emitters (aerosol and open cell foam), hermetically-sealed refrigeration, non-hermetically-sealed refrigeration and closed cell foam. Emission characteristics of these product classifications have been assessed using the assumptions of Bach and Jain10 and Gamlen et al.11 Most of the CFC-113 is emitted promptly, but an estimated 15% of the production is lost in waste disposal, dumps, and incinerators. 12 Thus for calculation purposes, we assume that world emission of CFC-113 is 85% of world production. Halons are largely banked in the fire extinguishing systems. Small amounts are emitted through leakage, fire practices and when the units are disposed. Thus it is assumed that for Halons the total annual production is added to the quantity that is already stored, the bank, and fixed fraction of this bank is emitted annually according to the procedure described by Bach and Jain.10 CFC-114, -115, CCl4, HCFC-22, and Methyl Chloroform will be released shortly after their production, thus it is assumed that their annual emission rates are equal to their production rates.CH4. The methane concentration in the atmosphere is calculated by simulating the main atmospheric chemical processes influencing the global concentrations of CH4, CO, and OH, using the global CH4-CO-OH cycle model developed by Rotmans et al.13 The removal rates of CH4 and CO are determined by accounting for the uptake by soils, transport to the stratosphere, and oxidation by OH radicals. We assume the uptake velocity by soils and the transport velocity to the stratosphere to be time-independent, although there is evidence that these values change with time.14 The concentration of OH radicals is determined by the photochemical balance between production of OH and the loss rate due to reaction with CH4 and CO.15 The reaction rate constants for the reactions of CH4 and CO with OH are taken from the recent measurements by Vaghjiani and Ravishankara.16 The source of OH radicals in the troposphere is the reaction between excited state oxygen atoms and water vapor. The excited oxygen atoms are produced by ozone photolysis at wavelengths below about 310 nanometers. Thus, ozone is the source of hydroxyl in the troposphere. In turn, nitrogen oxides (NOx) are the photochemical source of tropospheric ozone. Under low-NOx conditions, the methane oxidation reactions result in a decrease of ozone and OH. When high-NOx conditions exist, methane oxidation results in a net increase of ozone and OH. In this study, we assume ambient conditions representative of the low-NOx case. The contribution of NOx to the greenhouse effect as a photochemical precursor of ozone is not considered in this study.Climate ModelWe use the globally averaged energy balance climate model developed by Harvey and Schneider.17 This box advection-diffusion model contains a vertically integrated atmosphere box, a mixed-layer ocean box, an advective-diffusive deep ocean, and a thin slab representing land thermal inertia. In the deep ocean, heat is transported upwards with an advection velocity, and downwards by physical processes represented by a single, effective diffusion coefficient. Perturbations in the net radiative forcing from CO2 and other trace gases are computed using formulae of Shine et al.18, which were derived from detailed radiative transfer models. For H2O the radiative forcing is approximately 1/3 that of CH4.18 The contribution of stratospheric H2O is very uncertain and may be less important than modeled using this formulae; its contribution, however, is small, amounting to a maximum of 0.4 Wm-2 by 2100.19The response of the climate system to the changes in radiative forcing is principally determined by the climate sensitivity, deltaT2X, defined as the equilibrium surface temperature increase for doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. This parameter is intended to account for all the climate feedback processes not modeled explicitly. Explicit feedbacks included in the model are the temperature dependence of CO2 solubility (the buffer factor), terrestrial biosphere exchange rates, and methane chemical kinetics. Recent general circulation model estimates for deltaT2X range from 1.5 to 4.5  C.1 Lindzen20 proposed the value of deltaT2X could be as low as 0.5  C. Based on the observed temperature record, Schlesinger and Jiang21 found the value of deltaT2X =1.2  C; but as discussed by Kheshgi and White22,23 there is large uncertainty in deltaT2X estimated from the observed temperature record because of the unknown contribution from the climate's natural variability.24 deltaT2X = 2.5  C is considered by some25,26 as the best estimate of climate sensitivity. In the present study, the calculations have been performed for the three values of the climate sensitivity, namely 1.5, 2.5 and 4.5  C.Sea Level Rise ModelThe effects of global warming on sea level are determined by four processes: (i) thermal expansion of the ocean water (ii) melting of mountain glaciers, (iii) ablation of the Greenland Ice Sheet, and (iv) ablation or accumulation of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (notably the West Antarctic Ice Sheet). The sea level model shown in Fig. 1 uses the calculated transient temperature changes to estimate sea level changes due to thermal expansion and melting ice.For the calculation of the thermal expansion we use the thermal expansion coefficients from Leyendekkers27 which are salinity and temperature dependent. Vertical variations in thermal expansion are included explicitly in our model. Volume changes of glaciers and small ice caps are estimated according to Oerlemans.28 With respect to the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, the dynamic response can be ignored for the time scale considered here. The static changes in the surface mass balance are modeled according to Warrick and Oerlemans29 and Oerlemans.28MODEL VALIDATIONWe validate model components by comparison to available data. In this section we report comparisons of reconstructions of past sea level, global temperature and CO2 concentration to model results.Fig. 2 compares the computed atmospheric CO2 concentration to the observed CO2 record spanning from 1765 to 1990. The observed record from 1765 to 1959 is obtained from infrared laser spectroscopy measurements taken from the Siple ice-core30, and thereafter it is from the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii.31 Starting from a preindustrial concentration of 278 ppmv CO2, the model result accurately reproduces the growth of CO2 evident in the record. In 1990, the modeled atmospheric CO2 concentration was 354.2 ppmv as compared to the observed concentration of 353.8 ppmv.In Fig. 3, the record of the global mean surface air temperature compiled by Jones et al.32, given as anomalies from the mean temperature from 1950 to 1979, are compared with model results. The model calculations are presented for climate sensitivities deltaT2X of 1.5, 2.5 and 4.5  C. The model temperature curves are based on the effects of the greenhouse gases taken into account here, while the temperature record also incorporates natural climatic variations and other possible additional anthropogenic influences. For example, solar irradiance changes as well as stratospheric and tropospheric aerosols have been estimated to have an effect the surface temperature33, 34, 35. In this paper, however, we do not account for the influence of solar irradiance and aerosols, because of the uncertainty in estimating both past and future effects. The model-calculated surface temperature changes in 1990, relative to a 1950-1979 reference period, are 0.23, 0.34, 0.48  C for the CO2 doubling temperature sensitivities 1.5, 2.5 and 4.5  C, respectively. This compares to an observed temperature anomaly of 0.38  C in 1990.32Fig. 4 compares the calculated mean sea level rise from 1880 to 1985 with the observed values shown as deviations from the 1951 to 1970 period.36 For the climate sensitivity range of 1.5 to 4.5  C, the model-estimated sea level rise from 1765 to 1990 ranges from 5.6 to 13.6 cm. Our estimated mean sea level rise is similar to that obtained by Oerlemans37 (ca. 9.5 cm from 1850 to 1985), and Gornitz et al.38 (ca. 10 cm from 1880 to 1980).This type of model validation increases the confidence in the model calculations which are the only tools available for evaluating possible future trends. Future emission scenarios are examined in the following section.ASSESSING EMISSIONS AND STABILIZATION SCENARIOSConcern over the potential impacts of climate change caused by increases in greenhouse gases has led to policy proposals to reduce the rate of greenhouse gas emissions. The objective put forth in the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) as signed at the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio in 1992 is:39    * ..."the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"      and    * ..."such a level should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner."This objective, however, does not state quantitative targets. Specific measures will likely be designed to affect emission rates. The impacts of climate change are likely to be more closely related to properties of the climate system, such as sea level or global temperature, than to emission rates of greenhouse gases. Here we consider three observable quantitative properties of the climate system: global nearsurface temperature, the rate of temperature change, and sea level. While the Integrated Science Model is not intended to estimate impacts, it is our hope that relation of emission rates to properties of climate will assist in evaluating policy options.We use our Integrated Science Model to estimate the rate of emissions implied by Stabilization Scenarios. Stabilization Scenarios set the time variation of greenhouse gas concentrations leading to constant concentrations at some level. We also estimate the buildup of greenhouse gas concentrations, global temperature and its rate of change, and sea level implied by Emissions Scenarios. Emissions Scenarios set the time variation of emission rates of the various greenhouse gases. These analyses allow comparison of these different types of scenarios, within model uncertainties. Our Integrated Science Model is used to estimate the above quantitative properties of climate resulting from an Emissions or Stabilization Scenario, however, it cannot be used to imply target values.Stabilization ScenariosDevising strategies to meet the Rio Convention's objective of stabilization of concentrations requires a quantitative relationship between emissions and concentration. The calculations presented in this section illustrate aspects of what may be required to achieve stabilization of CO2 concentration. For CO2, IPCC WG1 has provided illustrative CO2 concentration pathways shown in Fig. 5a leading to stabilized CO2 concentrations of 350, 450, 550, 650, and 750 ppmv. These concentration pathways span a range of scenarios from stabilization at recent CO2 concentration (350 ppmv) to a scenario (750 ppmv) that resembles the IPCC1 business-as-usual (BAU) scenario for times before 2100. In addition, one scenario for emissions caused by land use change was specified and is intended to be used in tandem with the five CO2 pathways. The relation between these scenarios and the FCCC39 stabilization objective has not been determined.We use our Integrated Science Model to perform an inverse carbon cycle calculation to estimate the time varying fossil fuel emissions of CO2, shown in Fig. 5b, required to match the five concentration stabilization scenarios. These calculations are considered in the IPCC 1994 Report on Radiative Forcing of Climate for which the results of our Integrated Science Model was contributed.40 All the calculations show that stabilization requires a reduction in emissions at some time in the future. In all the stabilization cases, there are increasing emissions initially followed by rapid decreases. Moreover, in case S350 fossil fuel emissions are reduced to below zero, before rising to a small positive value. Negative emissions would have to be accomplished by introduction of a new (or enhancement of an existing) CO2 sink. These results show that the small relative changes in prescribed CO2 concentrations lead to large changes in fossil fuel emissions. The high sensitivity of the inverse calculation implies that uncertainties will be magnified when using this approach to define strategies for emission reductions that would track a prescribed path to concentration stabilization. Estimation of the effect of the terrestrial biosphere feedback (to rising CO2 and changing climate) on carbon cycle is a likely source of inaccuracy. In addition, the inverse calculation also requires estimates of land use emissions whose future magnitudes are highly uncertain which implies a comparable uncertainty in estimated CO2 emissions goals.Defining Requirements for Limiting Climate Change and Protecting EcosystemsOne way of developing criteria for climate and ecosystem protection would be to determine the maximum rate at which ecosystems can adapt to changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. At the Villach and Bellagio Climate Conferences41 it was suggested that a global rate of temperature change of 0.1  C per decade change be taken as an initial target value, which would allow for the adaptation of ecosystems. However, decadal changes in global temperature greater than 0.1  C are evident in the instrumental record (see Fig. 3). We use 0.1  C per decade and a mean global warming of 2  C from preindustrial time to 2100 as Illustrative Reference Values for climate and ecosystem protection. In the following analysis of Emissions Scenarios, results can be compared to these Illustrative Reference Values.IPCC Emissions ScenariosTable 1a lists the Emission Scenario from 1990 to 2100 for the twelve greenhouse gases corresponding to Scenario IS92a of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC)42. This scenario is a close approximation to the earlier IPCC1 BAU Scenario. Scenario IS92a takes into account only those emission control policies that were internationally agreed upon at that time.42In Scenario IS92a, CO2 produced from fossil fuel burning and cement production increases by factor of three from 1990 to 2100, whereas CO2 emissions from forest burning are considerably reduced. In the late 21st century there is a small rate of CO2 absorption from the atmosphere due to reforestation. N2O and CH4 emissions, which include both anthropogenic and natural sources, increase ~30% and 60%, respectively, by 2100. CFCs and Halon are being completely phased out and to a large extent substituted by the partially-halogenated HCF-22. Greenhouse gas emissions, reported as Equivalent CO2 Emissions (see Table 1a for values and definition), increase 74% between 1990 and 2100.Table 1b shows the emission changes of low emissions IPCC scenario IS92c.42 CO2 produced from fossil fuels and cement production show a 23% reduction. There is an increase in N2O and CH4 of 6% and 8%, respectively, and although the CFCs and Halon are being phased out, the nine fold increase of HCFC-22 of IS92a is maintained. Overall, in terms of Equivalent CO2 Emissions, there is a 26% reduction.Equivalent CO2 Emissions for the scenarios IS92a, IS92c are shown in Fig. 6a. Equivalent CO2 Emissions are based on the 100-year GWP-estimates of the IPCC43. For comparison between scenarios and for comparison to the FCCC stabilization objective we also define and calculate Equivalent CO2 Concentration:The radiative forcing of gas i is (eta)i (W/m2). The combined radiative effect of all greenhouse gases considered in our Integrated Science Model is represented by the Equivalent CO2 Concentration calculated for the two IPCC scenarios is shown in Fig. 6b. In IS92a scenario the Equivalent CO2 Concentration is modeled to have increased from 415 ppmv to over 900 ppmv by 2100, and is rate of increase is accelerating. In contrast, in IS92c scenario the Equivalent CO2 Concentration is modeled to have increased to 600 ppmv by 2100, and the rate of increase is still positive but decreasing. The concept of climate stabilization would ultimately call for a constant Equivalent CO2 Concentration.Equivalent CO2 Concentrations for the IPCC scenarios are used to calculate global mean temperatures. We use the Integrated Science Model to estimate the rates and levels of global mean temperature change. Temperature and its rate of change can then be compared to the Illustrative Reference Values described above. Fig. 7a shows estimates of the global temperature change from its preindustrial value for Emissions Scenarios IS92a and IS92c. Estimates are, of course, highly dependent on the value of climate sensitivity. Results for deltaT2X = 1.5 and 4.5  C are shown. This range in climate sensitivities results in a range of estimated temperature rise comparable to that caused by the difference between scenarios. The results indicated that both IPCC scenarios are sufficient to keep the increase the global temperature below the illustrative warming ceiling of 2  C (for times up to 2095) for a climate sensitivity of 1.5  C. Both scenarios lead to greater than 2  C warming for a climate sensitivity of 4.5  C . In scenario IS92a, a warming of 2  C is exceeded as early as 2030, 2055, and 2095 for climate sensitivities of 4.5, 2.5, and 1.5  C, respectively.The rate of the climate change is thought to exert stress on ecosystems. While changes in, for example, precipitation or infrequent events such as droughts or storms may be more directly related to this stress, there remains great uncertainty in estimating these characteristics of climate. Instead we consider only the rate of global temperature change shown in Fig. 7b. From preindustrial time to 1950 the rate of warming estimated to be caused by the anthropogenic release of greenhouse gases is calculated to be less than 0.08  C per decade (Fig.7b). The observed rate of temperature change over this time period, largely effected by natural variability, is significantly greater (Fig. 3). It is remarkable that the rate of anthropogenic-caused temperature change is calculated to be not much greater than the present for IS92a, and less than the present for IS92c. There may, however, be greater sensitivity of ecosystems to temperature increase in warmer climates.The model estimated effect on sea level is shown in Fig. 8 of scenarios IS92a and IS92c. There is a longer time lag for effects on sea level, than on global temperature. For the climate sensitivity range of 1.5 to 4.5, the model-estimated sea level rise in 1990 ranges from 5.6 to 13.6. Estimates of sea level rise from 1990 to 2100 range from 16 cm for IS92c with a climate sensitivity of 1.5  C, to 46 cm for IS92a with a climate sensitivity of 4.5  C.CONCLUSIONSIntegrated assessment models are intended to represent processes that govern physical, ecological, economic and social systems. This report describes a scientific model relating emissions to global temperature and sea level. This model is intended to be one component of an integrated assessment model which is, of course, much more comprehensive. The model is able to reproduce past changes in CO2 concentration, global temperature, and sea level. The model is used to estimate the emissions rates required to lead to stabilization of CO2 at various levels. The model is also used to estimate global temperature rise, the rate of temperature change, and sea level rise driven by IPCC emissions scenarios IS92a and IS92c. The emission of fossil fuel CO2 is modeled to have the largest long term effect on climate. Results do show the importance of expected changes of trace greenhouse gases other than CO2 in the near future. Because of the importance of these other trace gases, further work is recommended to more accurately estimate their effects.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://sedac.ciesin.org/mva/iamcc.tg/articles/SC1992/SC1992.html<TEXT>Global warming from carbon dioxide was an esoteric topic 15 years ago, unknown to most of us. But in a few years, helped along by some hot summers, it has climbed to the top of the international agenda. Cabinets, Parliaments, and heads of government have issued pronouncements on reducing carbon emissions, and in June of this year more than a hundred governments will be represented by ministers or heads of government at a great United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to be held in Rio de Janeiro. Together with non-governmental organizations representing labor, business, students, environmentalists, scientists, and groups concerned with health and child development and family planning, these representatives are expected to need 25,000 hotel rooms. A "framework agreement" is widely expected, together with some institutional arrangements that will keep global environmental issues permanently on every government's agenda. And at the center of these issues will be the phenomenon that has come to be known as the "greenhouse effect."The greenhouse effect itself is simple enough to understand and is not in any real dispute. What is in dispute is its magnitude over the coming century, its translation into changes in climates around the globe, and the impacts of those climate changes on human welfare and the natural environment. These are beyond the professional understanding of any single person. The sciences involved are too numerous and diverse. Demography, economics, biology, and the technology sciences are needed to project emissions, atmospheric chemistry, oceanography, biology, and meteorology are needed to translate emissions into climates; biology, agronomy, health sciences, economics, sociology, and glaciology are needed to identify and assess impacts on human societies and natural ecosystems. And those are not all.There are expert judgments on large pieces of the subject, but no single person clothed in this panoply of disciplines has shown up or is likely to. So, I venture to offer my judgment.First on the principle. The metaphor of the greenhouse is not quite appropriate, but the basic idea is not in dispute. The earth is bathed in sunlight, some reflected and some absorbed. If the absorption is not matched by radiation back into space, the earth gets warmer until the intensity of that thermal radiation matches the absorbed incoming sunlight. Some gases in the atmosphere that are transparent to sunlight absorb radiation in the infrared spectrum, blocking that outward radiation and warming the atmosphere. When the atmosphere has warmed enough to intensify the thermal radiation so that it matches the absorbed incoming sunlight, equilibrium is achieved at the higher temperature. These so-called "greenhouse" gases can be identified in the laboratory. Carbon dioxide is one of them; methane is another, as is nitrous oxide, as are the chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's).The principle has been in practice for decades. On a clear day in January, the earth and its adjacent air in Orange County California warm nicely, but the warmth radiates rapidly away during the clear nights, and frost may threaten the trees. Smudge pots, burning cheap oil on a windless night, produce substances, mainly carbon dioxide, that absorb the radiation and protect the trees with a blanket of warm air. Greenhouses, in contrast, mainly trap the air warmed by the earth's surface and keep it from rising to be replaced by cooler air. The phenomenon should have been called the "smudgepot effect," but it is too late to do anything about it.A first step in pursuing this phenomenon is to assess how much warming might go with an enhanced concentration of these gases. That cannot be done in the laboratory; there are too many feedbacks. A warmer atmosphere will contain more water vapor; water vapor itself is a greenhouse gas. Changes in temperature and humidity will change cloud cover; clouds can reflect or absorb incoming or outgoing light according to their composition and altitude. The average temperature is only one dimension; temperatures at different altitudes and different latitudes matter. But a starting point has been the change in average surface atmospheric temperature expected to accompany a specified increase in the concentration of greenhouse gasses; and arbitrarily, but reasonably, the base case is taken as a doubling of the concentration.A moment on why a doubling is the benchmark. To compare estimates of warming, people must use the same hypothesized concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. (Alternatively, they could use the same hypothesized temperature increase and estimate the corresponding concentration.) Doubling, like a half-life in reverse, is a natural unit if it is within the range of practical interest, and it is. A doubling is expected sometime in the next century, so it is temporally relevant; and a doubling is estimated to make a substantial but not cataclysmic difference. If fixation on a doubling seems to imply an upper limit on any unexpected increase, the implication is unfortunate: enough fossil fuels exists to support several doublings.In 1979, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) (1979 p. 2) estimated the change in average temperature to accompany a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: three degrees Celsius, with a range of 1.5 degrees to either side. (In the last 15 years other greenhouse gases have received attention; these other gases can be converted to their carbon dioxide equivalents and the original estimate applied to the mixture.) Then NASA appointed another committee a few years later to reexamine that estimate, and the new committee saw no reason to change it. (NASA, 1982 p. 51). An intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), consisting of scientists from many nations, revisited the estimate in 1990 and concluded, from the several climate models they had examined, that "the models results do not justify altering the previously accepted range of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees C" (IPCC, 1990 p. xxv). Thus, the estimate appears to be robust over time, but the spread of uncertainty remains large: the upper limit is three times the lower limit. (No quantitative interpretation of these upper and lower "limits" has been made public. Both National Academy reports referred to them as "probable error."The uncertainties are even greater in translating a temperature change into climates. The media support a popular view that things will just get hotter; a news magazine cover was a sweating global face. But the laboratories that do the meteorology do not simply predict warming; they do not even predict that the most noticeable effect will necessarily be temperature changes. Among the great driving forces of weather and climate is the temperature differential between equatorial and polar regions; convection currents coupled with the rotation of the earth are engines of atmospheric circulation and, ultimately, ocean circulation. The models predict greater temperature change in the polar regions than near the equator. This change in gradient can drive changes in circulation. The results may be warmer in some places and colder in others, wetter in some places and drier in others, cloudier in some places and sunnier in others, stormier in some places and less stormy in others--generally a complex of changes that would bear no easy relation to an average change in global temperature.The change in average temperature is useful as an index of climate change. It is thought, and the models demonstrate, that the greater the change in average temperature the greater the departure of current climates from what they are now. Thus, while it is wrong to think that what is going to happen can be readily characterized as "warming" it is not erroneous to take that average warming as a rough measure of the extent or severity of change to be expected. Unfortunately the widespread reference to "global warming" promotes the notion that things will simply get hotter. (Interestingly, virtually all public discussion is on hotter summers, not warmer winters; a hundred years ago popular discussion of a warming trend would likely have concentrated on the milder winters to be expected.)If three degrees Celsius is taken as an index of climate change to come within the next century or so, how big is that compared with what has happened within the last century, or the last 10,000 years From what I have just said, this cannot be answered in terms of whether anyone would notice the difference if every night and every morning, every winter and every summer, temperatures were exactly three degrees higher than they otherwise would have been. The question is: how would a three-degree change in a global average compare with what has been experienced in the past?The answer is that for 10,000 years, since the disappearance of the last ice age, average temperature appears never to have varied over anything like three degrees. A band of one degree Celsius would cover the current estimates of what average temperatures have been since the dawn of recorded history. We will be moving into a climatic regime that has never been experienced in this the current interglacial period."Mankind will undergo greater climate change in the next 100 years than has been experienced in the last l0,000." Properly qualified, the statement is true; what it neglects is that peoples have been migrating over great distances for at least several thousand years. Goths and Vandals, Huns, West Europeans who populated North and South America, Southerners who went North during the Great Depression, and Northeasterners who moved southwest after World War II all experienced changes in climate greater than any being forecast by the models. Almost everybody who attends this lecture in New Orleans will have undergone a greater change in the past few days than is expected to occur in any fixed locality during the coming century.The changes that the models produce are gradual both in time and in space. The models do not produce discontinuities. Climates will "migrate" slowly. The climate of Kansas may become like Oklahoma's, Nebraska's like that of Kansas, South Dakota's like Nebraska's, but none of these is expected to become like the climates of Oregon, Louisiana, or Massachusetts.A caution: the models probably cannot project discontinuities--just gradual change --because nothing goes into the models that will produce catastrophes. There may be phenomena that could produce drastic change, but they are not known with enough confidence to introduce them into the models. So the reassuring gradualness may be an artifact of the methodology. I will return to this point later.This greenhouse problem, if problem it proves to be, is truly one of the "global common." A ton of carbon emitted anywhere on earth has the same effect as a ton emitted anywhere else. And carbon dioxide has a long residence time in the atmosphere: a century or more. There may be ways to remove it, but it doesn't disappear. The greenhouse influence on any national territory depends solely on the global concentration, not in any way on what part of the total is due to a nation's own emissions.As I shall detail later, the costs of reducing carbon emissions will be large compared with any other emissions that have caused concern. The costs of phasing out CFC's will be in the billions of dollars per year for some years, and complete elimination is expected to be feasible. The cost of reducing sulfuric acid may be in the tens of billions of dollars. Proposals to hold emissions of carbon dioxide constant (with a linear increase of concentration in perpetuity) or to reduce emissions by 50 percent below what they would otherwise be, beginning perhaps in 2010, are expected to cost in the hundreds of billions in perpetuity.There are a few numbers worth carrying in mind. There are 700 billion tons of carbon in the atmosphere. (Quotations are sometimes in tons of carbon dioxide, rather than carbon; the figure is then 323 times as large, about 2,600 billion.) Annual emits emissions are 6 billion tons. Close to half disappears somewhere, and a little over half remains in the atmosphere; so the concentration is increasing by one-half percent per year. It has increased 25 percent in the last hundred years. (Concentration is reported more often than tonnage; it is currently about 350 parts per million.) And there are upwards of ten trillion tons of carbon fuels out there to be burned; if it were all burned and half stayed in the atmosphere, the concentration could double at least three times.If the carbon in the atmosphere has already increased by a quarter, has the average temperature gone up as predicted? And were the recent hot American summers that stirred popular interest harbingers of green house summers to come?To the first question, the answer is that average global temperature--summer and winter, both hemispheres, night and day--has apparently risen by half a degree in the last hundred years, but whether "as predicted" depends on what qualifications one reads into the predictions. The pattern differed between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres The global average rose during the first 40 years of this century, was level for the next 40 years, and rose during the past decade. This pattern demonstrates that, whether or not we are witnessing the greenhouse effect, there are other decades long influences that can obscure any smooth greenhouse trend. (The carbon concentration is not at issue; it is well measured and shows steady rise on a decade scale.) There are known phenomena that could account for the irregular temperature increase of the past century, and whether we are witnessing the "signal" probably depends on whether one wants high confidence to reject a null hypothesis or is about to bet money on whether, another 25 years from now, looking back, all doubt will have been removed. I don't know what bets are being placed by "greenhouse scientists," but they are cautious in public on the question.To the second question--do the hot American summers of the past few years announce the arrival of a greenhouse, confirming predictions?--the answer is in two parts: maybe it's the greenhouse; but it's not what the greenhouse models predict. The global average in the four hot years of the past seven was only 0.2 degrees above the level of the preceding 40 years; and sudden hot American summers are not what the models predict.In anticipating the impact on human welfare or natural systems, two kinds of uncertainty are unlikely to be dispelled soon. One is simply the question of what the change will be in each region or locality. Current models are severely limited in their agreement with each other, in their handling of such topographical variables as mountain ranges, and in the fineness of the grids they superimpose on the globe. There is no great confidence that the models will be greatly improved within the next decade or two. A chaos-like process may defeat efforts to improve local predictions; and uncertainties in gross phenomena, such as the behavior of ocean currents under changed climatic conditions, may not be much better understood soon.Even if we had confident estimates of climate change for different regions of the world, there would still be uncertainties about the kind of world it is going to be 50, 75, or 100 years from now. Imagine if it were 1900 and the climate changes associated with a three-degree average temperature increase were projected to 1992. On what kind of world would we superimpose either a vaguely described potential change in climate or even a specific description of changes in the weather in all the seasons of the year, even for our own country. There would have been no way to assess the impact of changing climates on air travel, electronic communication, the construction of skyscrapers, or the value of California real estate. Most of us worked outdoors; life expectancy was 47 years (it is now 75); barely a fifth of us lived in cities of 50,000 or more. Anticipating the automobile, we might have been concerned with whether wetter and drier seasons would bring more or less mud, not anticipating that the nation's roads would become thoroughly paved. The assessment of effects on health would be without antibiotics or inoculation. And in contrast to most contemporary concern with the popular image of hotter summers to come, I think we would have been more concerned about warmer winters, later frost in autumn, and earlier thaw in the spring.If the world, both North America and the other continents, is going to change as much in the next 90 years as it has changed in the 90 just past, we are going to be hard put to imagine the effects of climate changes.Another thought experiment: suppose the kind of climate change expected between now and, say, 2080 had already taken place since 1900. Ask somebody 50, 60, or 80 years old what is different compared with when he or she was a child. Would the climate change be noticed? Even ask a 70 year-old farm couple living on the same farm where they were born: would the change in climate be among the most dramatic changes in either their farming or their lifestyle? I expect changing from horses to tractors and from kerosene to electricity, the arrival of the telephone and the automobile and the paving of roads, the development of pesticides and artificial fertilizer, to discovery of soy beans and the development of hybrid corn, and even improvements in outdoor clothing, veterinary, medicine, and agricultural practices generally would swamp the climate change. And if instead of living and working conditions we inquire about changes in wildlife and natural ecosystems, changes in regional climates would have been competing, in their impact on nature, with population growth and economic development.A conclusion we might reach is that a climate change would have appeared to make a vastly greater difference to the way people lived and earned their living in 1900 than to the way people live and earn their living today. Today very little of our gross domestic product is produced outdoors, susceptible to climate. Agriculture and forestry account for less than 3 percent of GDP, and little else is much affected. Some activities - tourism and holidays, professional sports, and school teaching--are seasonal, but many of the seasonalities are conventions that reflect the influence of climate in earlier times. (Children were needed in the fields in summer and could start school when the harvest was in; hockey and basketball used to be winter sports because one depended on ice and the other could fit in a building.)1Manufacturing rarely depends on climate, and where temperature and humidity used to make a difference, air conditioning has intervened. When Toyota chooses among Ohio, Alabama, and Southern California for locating an automobile assembly, geographical considerations are important, but not because of climate. Minerals are extracted where they happen to occur, and oil fields and coal mines inhabit all kinds of climates and are little affected. The U.S. Postal Service's vow that neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night will "stay these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds" sounds quaint in the era of email and fax.Finance is little affected by climate; similarly for health care, or education, or broadcasting. Transportation can be affected, but improvements in all-weather landing and take-off in the last 30 years are greater than any differences that climate makes. If the average effect is a warming, iced waterways and snow removal may decline in importance. Construction is affected, mainly by cold, and if the average effect is in the direction of warming, construction may benefit slightly.It is really agriculture that is affected. But even if agricultural productivity declined by a third over the next half century, the per capita GNP we might have achieved by 2050 we would achieve only in 2051. Considering that in most of the developed countries--the United States, Japan, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Israel--the agricultural problem has been protecting farmers, that agricultural productivity in most parts of the world continues to improve, and that many crops and cultivated plants will benefit directly from enhanced photosynthesis due to increased carbon dioxide, one cannot be certain that the net impact on agricultural productivity will be negative or, if negative, will be noticed in the developed world.I conclude that in the United States, and probably Japan, Western Europe, and other developed countries, the impact on economic output will be negligible and unlikely to be noticed.2 And there is no reason to believe that in these countries there could be a noticeable impact on health. Any influence of climate on health in this country would be more in the regional distribution of the population than in changes in local and regional climates.Comfort is worth considering. Fortunately, the climate models predict a greater warming in winter than in summer. Most people in the United States, Japan, and Western Europe go south for vacation, both summer and winter; and when people move upon retiring in the United States they typically move toward warmer climates. In future years, elderly people may suffer more heat stroke in summer in St. Louis, but we can hope for fewer broken bones from ice in Boston. (Inhaling air richer in carbon dioxide has no effect on health.)This complacent assessment cannot be extended to the much larger population of the underdeveloped world. The livelihoods earned in agriculture and other climate sensitive outdoor activities, 3 percent in the United States, comprise 30 percent and more of all livelihoods in most of the developing world. Reliable forecasts of likely climate changes in the different areas, so dependent on agriculture are simply not available, so no assessment, region by region, of the effect on productivity can be provided. There is no strong presumption that the climates prevailing in different regions 50 or 100 years from now will be less conducive to food production. But there is also no assurance that climate changes will not be harmful, and even if on balance the impact is neutral, there may be large areas with large populations that suffer severely. Those people are vulnerable in a way that Americans, Western Europeans, and Japanese are not.Nor can the impact on health be dismissed or readily subsumed among generally improving health conditions, as for the developed world. Numerous parasitic and other vector-borne diseases affecting hundreds of millions of people are sensitive to climate. Again, there is no strong presumption that malaria mosquitos, to take an example, will on balance benefit from climate changes, but the risk is there.It is with the less-developed countries that we have to be most careful about superimposing the climates of the future on the economies and societies of today. As it was in our own country during this century, the trend in developing countries is to be less dependent on agriculture and less vulnerable to climate in transportation and other activities and health. If per capita income growth in the next 40 years compares with the 40 years just past, vulnerability to climate change should diminish, and the resources available for adaptation should be greater. I say this not to minimize concern about climate change, but to anticipate the question of whether developing countries should make sacrifices in their development to minimize the emission of gases that may change climate to their disadvantage. Their best defense against climate change may be their own continued development.This is a point worth emphasizing. Some environmentalists argue that developing countries should sacrifice some of their hopes for economic development in the interest of slowing the climate change that may prove disastrous. But the advice contains a contradiction Any disaster to developing countries from climate change will be a disaster to their economic development. What is desired is to optimize development by investing in greenhouse-gas abatement only when that appears, subject to all the uncertainties, to contribute more to their development in the future than the alternative direct investment in development. It is not economic growth versus environment; it is growth with the environment taken into account.A related point: population growth is important for the climate change, in two respects. One is that carbon emissions in developing countries are positively driven by population; population growth does not merely dilute carbon emissions per capita, but for a number of reasons more people means more carbon. If China succeeds in holding population growth to near zero for the next couple of generations, it may do as much for the earth's atmosphere as would a heroic Chinese anticarbon program coupled with 2-percent annual population growth.The other population effect is simply that the most likely adverse impact of climate change on human productivity and welfare would be on food production. In the poorest parts of the world, the adequacy of food depends on the number of mouths and stomachs. In a hundred years, adverse changes in climate for food production would be far more tragic if the countries we now associate with the developing world had populations totaling 12 billion than if they totaled 9 billion. For the developing worlds, the increasing concentration of people is probably more serious than the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide.At this point, I appear to have reached the conclusion that the developed world has no self-interest in expensively curtailing carbon consumption and that the developing cannot afford to incur economic penalties to slow the greenhouse effect. There is a mismatch between those who may be vulnerable to climate change and those who can afford to do anything about it.Why should the rich developed countries care enough about climate change to do anything about it? The answer must depend partly on how expensive it is going to be to do anything about it. Abatement programs have been examined in a number of econometric models that suggest we might want to treat as pertinent the sacrifice of perhaps 2 percent of world GNP in perpetuity.A strong argument for trying seriously to slow climate change is that the developing countries are vulnerable and we care. Developed countries are currently providing $50 billion per year of assistance to the developing world; we would be talking about expending or forgoing perhaps 4-8 times that much to slow emissions and slow climate change. Whether people in the developed democracies could be mobilized to contribute so much to benefit, half a century from now, the people in the countries we now call developing I do not know, but I believe that if the developed countries were prepared to invest, say, $200 billion per year in greenhouse-gas abatement, explicitly for the benefit of developing countries 50 years or more from now, the developing countries would clamor to receive the resources immediately in support of their continued development. There would undoubtedly be abatement opportunities so cheap that they could compete with direct aid to developing countries, but it would be hard to make the case that the countries we now perceive as vulnerable would be better off 50 or 75 years from now if 10 or 20 trillions of dollars had been invested in carbon abatement rather than in their economic development.A second argument for an expensive program of carbon abatement is that, while our production of material goods and services may not suffer from climate change, our natural environment may be severely damaged. Natural ecosystems will be destroyed; plant and animal species will become extinct. Places of natural beauty will be degraded. Valuable chemistries of plant and animal life will be lost before we learn their genetic secrets. And the earth itself deserves our respect. For many people, something close to religious values are at stake.This issue is doubly difficult to assess. It is difficult to know how to value what is at risk, and it is difficult to know just what is at risk. Even if climate changes at each point in time could be predicted accurately, the impacts on natural ecosystems could not yet be determined. And the benefits of slowing climate change by some particular amount would be even more uncertain. We know that carbon fuels are not going to be discontinued; the issue is the marginal gains, from carbon abatement and a slowing of climate change, in the survival of species and ecosystems and the preservation of enjoyable environments. This is an issue that simply has not been addressed.The third argument for spending heavily to slow climate change is that the conclusions I reported earlier may be quite wrong. I said that the climate models predict that climates will change slowly and not much; the models do not produce discontinuities, surprises, catastrophes. What is known about weather and climate constitutes an equilibrium system.The possibility has to be considered that if global temperature increases, not by the median estimate of three degrees Celsius for a doubling of carbon in the atmosphere, but by four or five degrees and continues to rise beyond the doubling because carbon fuels are still in use worldwide, some atmospheric or oceanic circulatory systems may switch to alternative equilibria, producing regional changes that are both sudden and extreme.Have any such possibilities been thought of? One that was thought of but diminished upon further investigation was the possibility that the west Antarctic ice sheet might glaciate into the ocean and raise the sea level by 20 feet. As recently as 15 years ago, the best scientific judgment was that this could happen within 75 years as a result of global warming. This prospect naturally attracted attention, and further investigation with the help of newly available satellite sensing of glacial movement led to reassuring estimates that if that catastrophic rise in sea level were to happen it would take at least a few hundred years and be gradual, not sudden. But there isn't any scientific principle according to which all alarming possibilities prove to be benign upon further investigation.A currently discussed likely source of discontinuous change is in the way oceans behave. Amsterdam is north of Newfoundland, yet is warmer, courtesy of the Gulf Stream. There is some indication that in earlier interglacial periods ocean current may have pursued different courses. If a current like the Gulf Stream, or the Japanese Current for the United States switched into an alternative pattern, the climatic consequences might be both sudden and severe. (Paradoxically, global warming might freeze Western Europe.)Insurance against catastrophes is thus an argument for doing something expensive about greenhouse emissions. But to pay a couple percent of GNP as insurance premium, one would hope to know more about the risk to be averted. I believe research to improve climate predictions should be concentrated on the extreme possibilities, not on modest improvements to median projections.I said that current estimates suggest that it might cost a couple percent of GNP to postpone the doubling of carbon in the atmosphere by several decades. Is 2 percent a big number or a small one?That depends on your perspective and on what the comparison is. In recent years 100 billion dollars per year in budgets or taxes has been a politically unmanageable magnitude in the United States. On the other hand, subtracting 2 percent from GNP in perpetuity lowers the GNP curve by not much more than the thickness of a line drawn with a number-two pencil, or to formulate it as I did earlier, it postpones the GNP of 2050 until 2051. I say this not to belittle the loss of 10 trillion dollars from the American GNP over the next 60 years, but only to point out that the insurance premium, if we choose to pay it, will not send us to the poorhouse. The proper question is whether, if we were prepared to spend 2 percent of our GNP in the interest of protecting against damage due to climate change, we might find better use for the money.I have mentioned one use: directly investing to improve the economies of the poorer countries. Another would be direct investment in preserving species, ecosystems, or wilderness areas. There is concern that many ecosystems could not migrate as rapidly as climate may change in the coming century; there has been little investigation of what might be done to facilitate the migration of ecosystems if the alternative is to invest 5 or 10 trillions of dollars in the reduction of carbon emissions.What can be done to reduce or offset carbon emissions? Reducing energy use and the carbon content of energy have received, I believe properly, most of the attention, especially the attention of economists. There are other possibilities to mention.Trees store carbon. In growing, they take it out of the atmosphere. When they rot or burn it goes back into the atmosphere. A new forest will absorb carbon until it reaches maturity (i.e., maximum carbon density) in 75 or 100 years. If it then merely replenishes itself, with new growth replacing the oxidized dead trees, it holds its carbon but does not absorb more. If trees are harvested, the lumber that becomes houseframes or furniture may last a hundred years or more; removing mature trees and storing them anaerobically is possible but expensive. The most recent report of the National Academy of Sciences considered that reforestation in the United States might sequester 2-3 percent of current global carbon dioxide emissions.3 The prospects for that kind of reforestation in the rest of the world are not nearly so promising, and we should conclude that reforestation can contribute, but not greatly.Stopping or slowing deforestation is important for reasons other than carbon emissions but is quantitatively more important than reforestation. Reforestation is unlikely to take up as much as 100 billion tons of carbon; deforestation, in areas where deforestation is likely, could contribute several hundred billion tons of carbon, partly because forest subsoils contain carbon typically greater than the amount in the trees themselves, and this carbon is subject to oxidation when the trees are removed.Carbon can be "scrubbed" from stack gases, probably not with any known technology that would make such removal economically competitive with reducing emissions. (Part of the expense is disposing of sludge; where gaseous carbon might be pumped into the ocean or into underground cavities, economical disposal may prove feasible.) Parallel to reforestation is the idea of enhancing oceanic photosynthesis, by "fertilizing" the oceans, possibly with iron, if enough of the carbon residues from the enhanced growth will sink rather than remain near the surface. Experiments would probably be reversible and modest in scale; their political acceptability may be tested in the near future.Finally--although nothing is final in a subject as new as the one we are talking about--there are numerous possibilities for putting substances or objects in orbit or in the stratosphere to reflect something like 1 percent of incoming sunlight to offset a large part of the radiation imbalance caused by greenhouse gases. Some of these are as apparently innocuous as stimulating cloud formation, and some are as dramatic as huge mylar balloons in low earth orbit. Until very recently these possibilities were nearly unmentionable, but they have recently been dignified by inclusion, along with caveats about "large unknowns concerning possible environmental side effects," in the 1991 report of the National Academy of Sciences. I shall not pursue them here, except for two observations. First, if in decades to come the greenhouse impact begins to confirm the more alarmist expectations, and if the economic sacrifices required to reduce emissions prove unmanageable for economic or political reasons, some of these "geoengineering" options will invite attention. Second, if they do, and especially if they prove to be within the budgetary capabilities of individual nations, international greenhouse diplomacy will be transformed.What remains nearly certain is that the main responses to the greenhouse threat will be adapting to climate as climate changes and reducing carbon emissions. (CFC's are potent greenhouse gases and, if unchecked, might rival carbon dioxide in decades to come; but international actions are making good progress and are among the cheapest ways of reducing greenhouse emissions.)Like estimates of warming, estimates of the costs of reducing emissions require some common but arbitrary objective to be comparable. A doubling of carbon became the conventional benchmark for warming estimates; no such benchmark for reduced carbon emissions has been adopted for estimating costs. (In principle, the estimates could adopt that doubling: the issue could be formulated as the cost of retarding the doubling time by a decade, two decades, or half a century.) Most estimates take as their target a reduction of emissions either to a specified fraction of what they would be in the absence of controls, or to some fixed ratio to the emissions of 1990 or the projected emissions of 2000 or 2010. The estimates examine minimum-cost trajectories, implicitly or explicitly assuming something like a uniform tax on the carbon content of fuel as the policy instrument. They typically make some assumption about a "fallback" energy technology, at least for electricity, available at some price in some decade of the next century. They have to project estimates of non-price-induced improvements in the use or avoidance of energy by industries and households. And if they deal with global emissions, they have to make some assumption about the distribution of abatement efforts among nations, especially among the developing countries, which, including China, account for about a quarter of emissions now and would be expected to account for half by the middle of the next century.Any estimate of the cost of abatement needs therefore to specify at least half a dozen target assumptions. Furthermore, the estimates are produced by people and institutions that do not simultaneously estimate the costs associated with climate change, either damages or costs of adapting; the estimates do not optimize the combined costs of abatement and climate change. A "not unreasonable" target for reduction might be delaying a doubling by, say, four decades. One decade might be too trivial, a century too ambitious, and four decades an objective in which most audiences would be interested. But nobody who makes such an estimate wishes to be interpreted as proposing that when all the uncertainties about climate changes and their impacts have been resolved, if they ever are resolved, the optimum reduction in emissions will be found to retard doubling by 40 years, or any other specified period of time.All I can do to summarize a multitude of estimates is to specify an order of magnitude that many economists and the Congressional Budget Office would not consider outrageous. That is the figure I mentioned earlier, possibly 2 percent of GNP for the developed countries and a similar, but even much more uncertain, percentage of GNP for the developing world. The uncertainty for the developing world is partly due to the estimates being mainly derived from the American economy.4Two characteristics of these estimates need to be emphasized. One is that they tend to assume optimal technological adjustment, as in response to a carbon tax. To the extent that carbon emissions are controlled by direct regulatory measures, there may be the usual expected inefficiencies, and I leave the reader to make his own adjustment.The second is that, since the early years of the energy crisis in the 1970's, there have been enthusiastic portrayals of currently available technologies, ranging from light bulbs to electric motors, double-glazed windows and improved internal-combustion engines, that for some reason have not been successfully marketed. The interest continues, and the recent National Academy of Sciences study gave sympathetic attention, but no analysis, to a number of proposals for residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation energy management and for improved electricity production and fuel supply and concluded that, including reductions in CFC's, "The United States could reduce or offset its greenhouse gas emissions by between 10 and 40 percent of I990 levels at low cost or at some neat saving, if the proper policies are implemented" (I991 p. 73).All of these ideas are completely orthogonal to the econometric estimates. The Academy panel that produced the report was unable to offer an explanation for why these low-cost or negative-cost technologies have not caught on. Its quantitative assessment, including an allowance for elimination of CFC's, ranged from as little as 10 percent to as much as 40 percent of current U.S. emissions; CFC's aside, their range of possibility is from zero to about 30 percent. Whatever the correct figure, this is probably a once-and-for-all backlog of accumulated technologies, which once exploited may be permanent but not progressive. But the strong suggestion is that there is a lot to be accomplished in the next two or three decades.With these qualifications, let us look at that 2 percent of GNP as a permanent reduction over the coming century. I consider it altogether improbable that the developing world, at least for the next several decades, will incur any significant sacrifice in the interest of reduced carbon (nor would I advise developing countries to do so). Anything done to reduce emissions in China, India, or Nigeria will be at the expense of the richer countries.Financing energy conservation, energy efficiency, and switching from high-carbon to lower-carbon or noncarbon fuels in Asia and Africa would not only be a major economic enterprise, but a complex effort in international diplomacy and politics. If successful, it would increase the costs to the developed world by at least another percent or two on top of the 2 percent I mentioned. It is furthermore not easy to hide the transfer of resources on the order of a couple of hundred billion dollars, dollars "budgeted" somehow or other, compared with hiding some of the costs due to regulation, such as automobile fuel-efficiency standards in the United States. The kind of thing we are talking about is inducing the Chinese, through our somehow offsetting their cost, to forgo a massive electrification based on coal and the cheapest coal-combustion technology. Without engaging in blackmail, the Chinese can assert that it is not in their interest to do that at their own expense, even if they are the keystone of a "social contract" and no other nation will do anything unless the Chinese fully participate.I shall sketch what I can imagine as a major attack on the greenhouse problem. And I should be explicit about what I cannot imagine. For reasons that I would be delighted to elaborate but for which I cannot take space here, a universal uniform carbon tax is not a solution that I can imagine. My reason is simple. A carbon tax sufficient to make a big dent in the greenhouse problem would have to be roughly equivalent at least to a dollar per gallon on motor fuel, and for the United States alone such a tax on coal, petroleum, and natural gas would currently yield close to half a trillion dollars per year in revenue. No greenhouse taxing agency is going to collect a trillion dollars per year in revenue; and no treaty requiring the United States to levy internal carbon taxation at that level, keeping the proceeds, would be ratified by the Senate. Reduce the tax by an order of magnitude and it becomes imaginable, but then it becomes trivial as greenhouse policy.5Tradable permits have been proposed as an alternative to the tax. There are two main possibilities: (i) estimating "reasonable" emissions country by country and establishing commensurate quotas or (ii) distributing tradable rights in accordance with some "equitably? criterion, such as equal emissions per capita (a possibility that has actually been discussed). Depending on how restrictive the aggregate of such tradable emission rights might be, the latter is tantamount to distributing trillions of dollars in discounted value and making, for a country like Nigeria, the outcome of its population census the country's major economic policy. If, instead, quotas are negotiated to correspond to every country's currently "reasonable" emissions level, they will surely be renegotiated every 5 or 10 years, and selling an emissions right will be perceived as evidence that a quota was initially too generous. It is unlikely that governments will engage in trades that acknowledge excessive initial quotas.I do not foresee negotiated national quotas subject to serious enforcement, especially enforcement through financial penalties. I think any international regime for carbon abatement can seriously include only the developed countries, and I exclude from this category the countries that we used to call the Eastern Bloc. I can easily imagine institutional arrangements that are universalist, some kind of "framework agreement" to which every country subscribes, with specific commitments to be negotiated later. But I expect serious commitments to be undertaken only by the countries that can afford to, and I am undecided whether an institutional pretense of a universalist system has advantages or, instead, the developed world should proceed independently and unencumbered with the need for a universalist facade.The model that I find most helpful in conceptualizing a greenhouse regime among the richer countries is the negotiations among the countries of Western Europe for distributing Marshall Plan dollars among themselves and the negotiations, beginning in 1951, on " burden sharing" in NATO. There was never a formula for distributing Marshall Plan Dollars; there was never an explicit criterion, such as equalizing living standards, equalizing growth rates, maximizing aggregate output or growth, or establishing a floor under levels of living. Baseline dollar-balance-of-payments deficits were a point of departure, but the negotiations took into account investment needs, traditional consumption levels, war-induced capital needs, opportunities for import substitution and export promotion, and opportunities to substitute intra-European trade for trade with hard-currency countries.The United States insisted that the recipients argue out and agree on shares. In the end, they did not quite make it, the United States having to make the final allocation. But all the submission of data and open argument led, if not to consensus, to a reasonable appreciation of each nation's needs. The negotiations were professional; they were assisted by a proficient secretariat. The resources involved for most recipient countries were immensely important. Good relations were observed throughout; and proficiency in debate, acceptance of criteria, and negotiating etiquette steadily improved.That is the only model I find plausible, and I believe distribution of Marshall Plan and defense-support funds to Europe is the only model of multilateral negotiation involving resources commensurate with the cost of greenhouse abatement. (In the first year, Marshall Plan funds were about 1.5 percent of U.S. GNP and--adjusting for overvalued currencies--probably 5 percent of OEEC GNP).What that model suggests is that the main participating countries in a greenhouse abatement regime would submit for each other's scrutiny and cross-examination plans for reducing carbon emissions. The plans would be accompanied by estimates of emissions or emissions reduction from some projected level, but any commitments undertaken would be to the policies, not the emissions. And not all of the plans would necessarily be commitments.The United States, for instance, could present a plan for the introduction of a new generation of nuclear power reactors beginning sometime in the next century, but it is difficult to see how the federal government can commit itself to what reactors public utilities will be purchasing 20 years from now. The United States can have a plan to mandate fuel-efficiency standards for automobiles, but it takes 10 years for the standards to work their way into the automobile fleet, and there is no accounting procedure that will estimate the effect on motor-fuel consumption of any level of average fuel efficiency a decade from now.The current popular expectation is that participation in any greenhouse regime will take the form of commitments to specified percentage reductions of emissions below those of some specified year, like 1990 or 2000. I cannot help believing that adoption of such a commitment is an indication of insincerity. A serious proposal would specify policies, like taxes, regulations, and subsidies and would specify programs (like research and development), accompanied by very uncertain estimates of their likely effect on emissions. In an international public forum, governments could be held somewhat accountable for the policies they had or had not put into effect, but probably not for the emissions levels achieved.Such a modest beginning will require finding a way to sublimate the current international enthusiasm for a new universalist greenhouse regime into institutional arrangements that are helpful but noncommittal when the U.N. Conference on Environment and Development convenes next June. This will require an understanding among the developed countries that it is initially up to them to find a way to mobilize their populations in support of national greenhouse policies.A major commitment to financing emissions abatement in the developing world is surely too far away to need specific plans now. A developing-world carbon-abatement effort would, in principle, be altogether different from foreign aid as we have known it since World War II. In principle it would all be directed, from whatever sources and through whatever channels, to protecting that same global common. There would be, for the first time, a single criterion: economizing carbon. In the abstract, aid recipients in the war on greenhouse gases would not compete; they would not make India-Pakistan comparisons, or Arab-lsrael, or Poland-Czechoslovakia. All would in principle benefit equally from maximum carbon conservation, wherever it could be achieved. Trees may grow more rapidly, in carbon content, in Madras or Szechuan or Borneo or Alaska or South Carolina, but if someone were willing to finance the growth of a tree to absorb carbon dioxide, the citizens of those states should not have the slightest care where the tree were to be planted; they all benefit solely from the carbon fixed in the tree and benefit more, the faster the tree grows, no matter where it grows.It wouldn't work that way, of course. Somebody gets the shade, or leases land for the tree; and if it's not a tree but a nuclear power plant to supplant coal, there are local impacts that make huge differences, and negotiations over sharing the cost differential between the coal and the nuclear plants. But it is worth noticing that if there were a "pure" carbon-abatement or carbon-absorbing technology, one that accomplished nothing else, there should be no dispute about locating it wherever it would be most effective. That is new in foreign aid and foreign investment.If the developed countries ever manage to act together toward the developing countries, their bargaining position is probably enhanced by the fact that cleaner fuels and more efficient fuel technologies bring a number of benefits other than reduced carbon, and recipients of greenhouse aid will be actively interested parties, not merely neutral agents attending to the global atmosphere. At the same time, large nations like India and China will be aware of the extortionate power that resides in ambitious coal-development projects.On a greatly reduced scale, there may be something constructive to do more immediately. There is a huge difference between transferring "technology" and transferring capital goods that embody technology or, going further, financing entire investments (local construction, etc.) in which the technology is embedded. The difference in cost is at least an order of magnitude. While the developed countries are feeling their way into some common attack on their own carbon emissions, a tangible expression of their interest and an effective first step would be to establish a permanent means of funding technical aid and technology transfer for developing countries, as well as research, development, and demonstration in carbon-saving technologies suitable to those countries. Eventually the rural Chinese household may cook more efficiently with nuclear-powered electricity, but for another generation or two what is important is less carbon-wasteful ways of cooking and heating.Maybe there is a role here for the carbon tax. Western Europe, North America, and Japan will be burning 3 or 4 billion tons of carbon per year for the next decade. Taxing themselves, that is, contributing in proportion to the carbon they consume, at one, two, or three dollars per ton, they could contribute to a fund that might begin at $3 billion per year and grow to $10 billion. The carbon tax is a little arbitrary here, and a U.S. administration may be wary about a precedent that carries over when the tax rises an order of magnitude, but compared with alternative criteria for sharing costs it might not even be a bad precedent.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/mva/iamcc.tg/articles/surprise.html <TEXT>Surprise and uncertainty are often confused in the literature and in public discourse; various meanings are used within different communities and cultures. Risk is classically defined as the condition in which the event, process, or outcome and the probability that each will occur is known. In reality, of course, complete knowledge of the probabilities and range of potential outcomes or consequences is not usually known and is sometimes unknowable. Uncertainty is defined as the condition in which the event, process, or outcome is known (factually or hypothetically) but the probabilities that it will occur are not known. When probabilities are assigned, they are subjective, and ways to establish reliability for different subjective probability estimates are debatable. Surprise is defined as the condition in which the event, process, or outcome is not known or expected. The research issue is how can we anticipate the unknown, improve the chances of anticipating, and, therefore, improve the chances of reducing societal vulnerability?    Use of a strict definition of surprise logically entails that we cannot anticipate the event, process, or outcome, because the very act of anticipation implies some level of knowledge. Assessments designated as "surprises," however, indicate that the events, processes, and outcomes so registered were, in fact, knowable in one manner or another. This second type of "surprise"- - a broad use of the term- - is one from which the global change community may learn much. After Holling, we adopt the following working definition of this second type: surprise is a condition in which perceived reality departs qualitatively from expectations. Using this working definition does not deny the existence of surprise of the first type (narrow definition). There are many possible typologies of surprise and uncertainty. Focusing on surprise of our second type and its subcategories, we will present a typology that may be particularly useful in distinguishing the sources of surprise and the difficulty in identifying and anticipating some types of surprise. This typology recognizes risk, uncertainty and ignorance. Here, risks are possible (usually undesirable) outcomes whose probability and existence are known. Uncertainty characterizes outcomes that are known to be possible but whose probabilities are not known. Ignorance, the main subject of the typology, is the most intractable: we are ignorant when we cannot or do not know a possible outcome. Reducible and hard to reduce ignorance categories will be distinguished. We will also present a long list of potential "gobal change surprises" cutting across physical, biological and social science disciplines, compiled by participants in an Aspen Global Change Institute workshop in which this paper's authors were the co- chairs.CLARIFYING TERMS1. Surprise and uncertainty are often confused in the literature and in public discourse; various meanings are used within different communities and cultures.2. Definitions    * risk: The condition in which the event, process, or outcomes and the probability that each will occur is known.      Issue: In reality, complete knowledge of probabilities and range of potential outcomes or consequences is not usually known and is sometimes unknowable.    * uncertainty: The condition in which the event, process, or outcome is known (factually or hypothetically) but the probabilities that it will occur are not known.      Issue: The probabilities assigned, if any, are subjective, and ways to establish reliability for different subjective probability estimates are debatable.    * surprise: The condition in which the event, process, or outcome is not known or expected.      Issue: How can we anticipate the unknown, improve the chances of anticipating, and, therefore, improve the chances of reducing societal vulnerability?3. Working definitionUse of a strict definition of surprise logically entails that we cannot anticipate the event, process, or outcome, because the very act of anticipation implies some level of knowledge. Assessments designated as "surprises," however, indicate that the events, processes, and outcomes so registered were, in fact, knowable in one manner or another. This second type of "surprise"-- broad use of the term--is that from which the global- change community may learn much.Following Holling (1986: 294), the AGCI group adopts the following working definition of this second type--    * Surprise is a condition in which perceived reality departs qualitatively from expectations.Use of this working definition does not deny the existence of surprise of the first type (narrow definition). Unless otherwise designated; however. the remainder of this report deals with surprise of the second type.LOGIC OF ANTICIPATING SURPRISE1. Given the second meaning, it is possible to anticipate a subset of surprises.2. For example, complex systems, chaos, and other such theories provide a conceptual and analytical basis for understanding that surprises will occur, and a variety of methods (e.g., simulations, backcasting) and assessments facilitate seeking and finding surprises.3. Coupled with experience, this understanding permits the identification of potential arenas wherein surprise may to take place.4. This identification may (should) inform the public and policy makers of the issues, and thus potentially allow reduced vulnerability and enhanced environmental and societal resilience to surprise.5. The probabilities that suspected "surprises" will take place within a specified arena are generated on a subjective basis (or by objective methods or models that rest on subjective assumptions), and vary significantly by individual, community, and culture.WHO IS SURPRISED AND WHY?1. Surprise is dependent on expectations. and thus we must analyze how expectations are formed by individuals and groups.2. This view implies that the degree of surprise depends on the extent to which reality departs from expectations and on the salience of the problem (e.g., hazards).3. Expectations reside not only in the individual, but with groups, communities, or cultures, such as experts, policy makers, managers, and educators, who can share common ranges of expectations that are generated by group dynamics, leaders, and signal processors.4. In many cases, surprise lies in the policy/managerial mindset and response to an unexpected or improbable (lowly anticipated: e.g., Three Mile Island) event.5. A variety of factors contribute to this subcategory of surprise (#4), including: differences of opinions among the expert community; fit with broader policy agendas; and vested interest of an agency or group to maintain a particular view.6. Factors that may contribute to surprise (of our second type) among the science and policy communities are those involved under conditions of systems complexity and connectedness. Integrated systems modeling, for example, informs that (i) one surprise may lead to another because of sub- system coupling and other such issues and (ii) cascading surprises may emerge.TYPOLOGICAL MAP/(Figure I)There are many possible typologies of surprise (and uncertainty) (e.g., Brooks 1986; Timmerman 1986). Focusing on surprise of our second type and its subcategories (e.g. #4 above), we have been informed by one that may be particularly useful in distinguishing the sources of surprise and the difficulty in identifying and anticipating some types of surprise. Adapting from Faber, Manstetten, and Proops (1992), Figure 1 shows a topology that recognizes risk, uncertainty, and ignorance. Here, risks are possible (usually undesirable) outcomes whose probability and existence are known. Uncertainty characterizes outcomes that are known to be possible but whose probabilities are not known. Ignorance, the main subject of the typology, is the most intractable: we are ignorant when we cannot or do not know a possible outcome. Following this typology and definition, ignorance may be where the most significant surprises lie. (It should be noted, however, that some do not make such strong distinctions among these three sources of surprise but see each as a variant on the same basic insight that outcomes are indeterminate.)Ignorance comes in two varieties. Closed ignorance is the unwillingness or inability to consider or recognize that some outcomes are not known but are perhaps possible. Open ignorance is the opposite and much more complicated. The willingness to acknowledge ignorance is a start to the identification of possible outcomes and anticipating surprises, but some forms of ignorance are easier to reduce than others. Ignorance that is relatively easy to reduce comes in two forms, depending on whether an individual or the group is ignorant. Personal or individual ignorance can be reduced by education, after which "surprises" may become "risks" on some typologies. On the other hand, communal ignorance requires creation of new knowledge through research, broadly within existing scientific concepts, ideas, and disciplines (what some call "normal" science--science within an existing paradigm but not necessarily science that causes a revolution to a new paradigm).The other type of open ignorance is more complex and less tractable. Ultimately all ignorance might be reducible, but much of it is very hard to overcome. Part of this hard- to- reduce ignorance stems from epistemology--the rules that we think govern how the world works and the language and symbols we use to describe what we think and observe. Some people use the term "paradigm" to describe those rules, relationships, symbols, and language. (Some point out that "epistemological ignorance" can be a form of "closed ignorance" because epistemological blinders lead to an unwillingness or unwitting inability to consider alternatives.) The other part of this "hard"- to- reduce ignorance is intrinsic to the phenomenon at hand. Some phenomena may simply be unpredictable, at least from the technologies and analytical perspective now in existence. Notably, systems characterized by chaos are currently thought to be unpredictable in detail--for example, detailed weather forecasts six months in advance are not possible, no matter how accurate the initial state of the weather condition is known because of chaotic dynamics of the atmosphere. And yet, the general character of some chaotic- like systems can be better understood, permitting models of them and, hence, forecasts of their impacts (e.g., E:l Nino or ENSO events). A further example of phenomenological ignorance is a change in the underlying forces of a system, producing markedly different observed outcomes.This typology is helpful because:    * it makes a distinction among risk, uncertainty, and surprise;    * it also makes clear that phenomenological surprise is only one category of ignorance; and,    * it suggests that many surprises are easily reducible,    * whereas others are blocked by epistemological blinders that create expectations that exclude some categories of outcomes and, hence, surprise.FITTING THE MAP FROM THE BOTTOM UPTable 1 and Table 2 present a series of surprises pertinent to global environmental change presented at the AGCI summer session on "Anticipating Global Change Surprises." To each candidate surprise (and in some cases highly uncertain outcomes that were perceived by many as surprises) in Table I are attached the sources attributed to them as understood by our group. Without reviewing each table entry here, it is possible to fit these sources within the typology presented above. A few cases of phenomenological ignorance were presented, particularly those in which the technology of data retrieval outpaced the analysis of data (e.g., misreading remotely sensed imagery, led to exaggerated estimates about the spatial scale of land- cover changes; erroneous assumptions about outlier values of stratospheric ozone delayed detection of the Antarctic ozone hole). Most of the cases, however, suggested sources of surprise in global environmental change may be closely aligned with the following: l    * narrowness of "paradigm" (epistemological ignorance)    * organizational goals and structure of organizational decision making not consistent with the problem (closed ignorance; epistemological ignorance)    * organizational goals in conflict with the outcome (closed ignorance)    * purposeful obfuscation and blocking (closed ignorance)    * rigid common frameworks (epistemological ignorance--frameworks/mindsets that impede effective use of normal science and learning)SCIENTIFIC VERSUS SOCIETAL SURPRISEOutcomes are frequently a surprise to some individual, group, institution, community,and culture, or to society as a whole. Many of the surprises noted in the literature on the subject are scientific surprises--surprises to the community of experts of a phenomenon or area. In contradistinction to these are societal surprises--surprises involving events, new discoveries, or assessments that are processed by social institutions and agents in ways that focus social attention on the surprise and place it on society's agenda for debate and possible action.Figure 2 illustrates this process. At any time, a number of new events or surprises vie for the attention of society as a whole. They enter a process that Kasperson and colleagues (1988) describe as social amplification and attenuation, whereby the processing of the event or discovery by information and response systems either strengthens or weakens the signal value to managers, policy makers, and publics. Thus, some genuine scientific surprises fail to be taken up by the mass media, watchdog groups, or policy makers and fail to make it onto the societal agenda. Other surprises, perhaps less salient to scientists, undergo substantial amplification in signal value due to intense coverage in the mass media, lobbying by critics or environmental groups, connection to social movements, or concern on the part of policy makers or regulators. Thus, it is important to distinguish between scientific and social surprise and to evaluate how events interact with societal processes to amplify or attenuate the perceived significance of the surprise to managers, social institutions, and publics.IMPROVING THE ANTICIPATION OF SCIENTIFIC SURPRISEThe sources of global- change surprise noted above point to several ways of improving the anticipation of the arenas or domains of surprise.l. Encourage and integrate the role of synthesis and synthesizers--appreciating "putting the puzzle together" and searching for connections across problem domains, disciplines, and perspectives.2. Focus a larger fraction of the research effort on "outlier" outcomes (e.g., applying methods to sample the opinions of a broad range of knowledgeable experts as to the likelihood of a wide range of imaginable outcomes).3. Support work at the edges (and across edges) of conceptual and problem areas.4. Promote process- as well as product- oriented research and encourage multiple disciplines and communities to communicate and integrate their knowledge about global- change problems.5. Insure the following attributes of research discourse and funding that have been insufficiently appreciated to date:    * skeptical welcoming of advocacy science/scientists and of the airing and professional evaluation of unconventional views; and    * multiplicity and constructive duplication of research domains among approaches and institutions.6. Work backwards from posited future states to identify events or processes that might happen along the way: backcasting scenarios or reconstruct past scenarios in alternative ways to examine what might have happened (e.g., Brooks l986).7. Encourage the "strategic paradigm" as well as the "efficiency paradigm" to build resilience into social and environmental systems.PREPARING FOR SURPRISE: BEYOND THE SCIENCEMany potential surprises can be anticipated as noted above. It is clear, however, that many hazard or problem arenas are intrinsically subject to surprise due to system complexity, lack of experience, or poor theoretical understanding. The scientific and managerial community and society as a whole should expect and prepare for the reality that, whatever anticipatory measures are undertaken, some surprises will inevitably occur. Put somewhat differently, the hubris that science and social science can predict the future sufficiently to anticipate the full range of both positive and negative surprises should be constrained. (For example, the recent Kobe earthquake has put to rest the notion that Japanese cities are adequately prepared to withstand major earthquakes.)It is, of course, the negative and potentially catastrophic surprises that are of particular concern. Managers and social institutions are not helpless to these surprises simply because specific events and outcomes cannot be predicted reliably or even (perhaps) anticipated. What can be done is to increase the resilience and adaptability of receptors (human and ecological) that are at risk, thereby decreasing the sensitivity to the impacts of the unexpected or uncertain perturbations. Actions aimed at increasing the resilience and adaptability of potentially affected systems are noted below. They do not represent recommendations of AGCI but are provided as examples of the broader ranging amplifications of surprise and global change.      l. Diversifying economic productive systems: the tendency towards increased economic specialization carries the risk of vulnerability to controls (e.g., markets or absentee landlords) well beyond the local area which can have both positive and negative impacts on local resilience to environmental perturbations.      2. Avoidance of technological monocultures: reliance on a single technology, such as nuclear power, may be vulnerable to environmental or other perturbations with negative impacts on the economy.      3. Strengthening the broader entitlement structures: providing robust safety nets to respond to unforeseen events is a critical part of resilience.      4. Adaptive management systems: organizational theory suggests that different management systems have different capacities for dealing with surprise; those doing better are characterized by openness, participation of all parties, and flexibility, while those faring less well are characterized by command- and- control systems.      5. Disaster coping systems: improving designs of early- warning, monitoring, and alerting systems, and strengthening the capability of private and public sectors to respond rapidly to potential disasters should be encouraged.      6. Organizational memory and social learning: measures that improve memory and the ability to learn from surprises improve overall resilience to vulnerability to surprise.CONCLUDING COMMENTSWriting over a decade ago, Kates (l985:50) noted that "one of the distinguishing features of the past l5 years is that surprise persists and, paradoxically, grows." Looking to the next l5 years, he concludes: "Finally, there will be surprises--surprises that in turn will generate new concerns and activities. There will also be other concerns and surprises unrelated to technological hazards, international tensions, social change, and resource needs" (p. 57). The professional community recognized global environmental change as new source of surprise and concern more than a decade ago. The international community, including the public and policy makers, now have the same recognition.1 There are, of course, many ways to typologize surprise. Our method focuses on the nature of source of surprise within individuals, communities, or cultures which largely involves different sources of ignorance. In contrast, Casti ( 1994: 263) provides a typology based on source of ignorance within the expert community. These sources are: paradoxical conclusions, discontinuity from smoothness, deterministic randomness, output transcends rules, behavior cannot be decomposed into parts, and self- organized patterns.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/308/5723/796<TEXT>Sergey A. Zimov, director of the Northeast Science Station in Cherskii in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), received his academic training in geophysics at the Far East State University in Vladivostok, Russia. He subsequently did fieldwork in northern Siberia for the Pacific Institute for Geography, part of the Far East Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 1980, he organized the science station that he now directs. Research at the center includes studies of global carbon and methane budgets and animal extinctions that occurred in Siberia when the Pleistocene epoch gave way to the ongoing Holocene about 10,000 years ago. In 1989, Zimov initiated a long-term project known as "Pleistocene Park," which he now is pursuing with a number of partners. The goal of the project is to reconstitute the long-gone ecosystem of the Pleistocene epoch that supported vast populations of large animals including mammoths, horses, reindeer, bison, wolves, and other large predators. If the effort succeeds in the park, Zimov and his co-workers would like to see the ecosystem restored over much larger areas in an effort to stave off what otherwise could be a massive release of carbon that now is sequestered in the permafrost but that could be released into the atmosphere as global temperatures rise. His hunting of mammoth remains in the tundra and his bold vision of controlling and restoring ecosystems have earned him coverage in books, documentaries, and other media.During the last ice age, the world's most extensive ecosystem stretched from France across the Bering Strait to Canada and from the arctic islands to northern China. It was at the very end of a more than million-year epoch, the Pleistocene, during which colossal ice sheets repeatedly advanced and retreated, plowing up much of northern Europe and America. At the same time, from a geological perspective, northeastern Siberia remained relatively unscathed. There, vast dust-covered plains and valleys dominated the landscape. Mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses, bison, horses, reindeer, musk oxen, elk, moose, saiga, and yaks grazed on grasslands under the predatory gaze of cave lions and wolves.The ground, as in Siberia today, froze, contracted, and cracked each winter. In spring, water penetrated and froze in deep, narrow cracks, creating networks of ice wedges. Over time, because of the slow accumulation of dust, river silt, and ice, the northern lowlands of Siberia became covered with a thick sedimentary mantle of frozen loess. These frozen sediments are filled with rootlets of grasses, microbes, and animal bones, all of which have enabled scientists to chronicle the rise and fall of the region's Pleistocene ecosystem.About 10,000 years ago, at the beginning of the Holocene epoch, this vast system, which I refer to as the mammoth tundra-steppe, disappeared completely. In northern Siberia, mossy tundra and forest tundra replaced the mammoth ecosystem. The only herbivores to survive were reindeer that grazed on lichens and moose that fed on willows. The mammoths and their large animal companions, which had survived even the worst conditions the ice age could muster, disappeared during the Holocene warming.It actually might not have been the climatic changes that killed off these great animals and their ecosystem, however. More consequential, perhaps, were shifts in ecological dynamics wrought by people who relied on increasingly efficient hunting practices, which decimated the very populations of grazing animals that maintained the tundra steppe. To test this possibility, my colleagues and I for the past decade have been working to reconstitute the mammoth ecosystem in one modest parcel of the northern Siberian region of Yakutia. We call our project Pleistocene Park. The primary scientific goal is to determine more precisely the role that Pleistocene animals played in maintaining their own ecosystem. However, we also suspect that by learning how to preserve and extend Pleistocene-like grasslands in the northern latitudes, we could subsequently develop means for mitigating both the progress and effects of global warming. The amount of carbon now sequestered in soils of the former mammoth ecosystem, and that could end up as greenhouse gases if released into the atmosphere by rising global temperatures, surpasses the total carbon content of all of the planet's rain forests.The Vanishing of the HerbivoresGrassland ecosystems are evolutionarily the youngest of ecosystems. These ecosystems have the highest rates of biogeochemical cycling. Grasses use water resources more rapidly than their less productive competitors, such as cactuses and trees, rather than spending energy for making thorns and toxins to ward off enemies. When their numbers reach a level that can be sustained by the landscape, herbivores eat and trample all the grassland vegetation produced during the rainy season and return nutrients to the soil through their manure. On different continents, at different latitudes, grassland ecosystems have been, and are now, composed of different species, but they share a similar set of functional types or guilds. These include grasses, elephants, horses, rodents, dung-beetles, large cats, vultures, and so on. The greater the diversity within and among these functional types, the more active the biological cycles and the more successful and extensive the ecosystem can become.    Figure 2 Horse sense. Grazing on a snow-covered tundra meadow in northern Siberia, rugged Yakutian horses like these could help reduce the effects of global warming by stabilizing vast expanses of grassland.In the Pleistocene, grassland ecosystems occupied about half of the world's land mass. Homo species emerged in these pasture ecosystems, where they left tools, weapons, cave paintings, and other signs of their presence. Starting with unpretentious ambitions to survive in a hostile environment, Homo ended up assuming the powerful role of ecosystem terminator. The mammoth ecosystem was the first large-scale victim, but the global destruction of grasslands only accelerated in the Holocene when people invented agriculture and began raising cattle.Twenty years ago, scientists explained the disappearance of numerous animals in the northern grasslands very simply--the arid steppe climate changed into a humid one, and when the steppe vanished so did the steppe's animals. In short, the moist Holocene climate was a catastrophe for them. In the last few years, however, a growing accumulation of radiocarbon dates of animal remains has been suggesting a different story. It appears now that mammoths survived the Pleistocene-Holocene shift. For the first 7000 years of the Holocene, they persisted on Wrangell Island in the Arctic Ocean. Bison, horses, and musk oxen also lived in the north of Siberia in the Holocene. Horses and musk oxen lived there even up to historical times.In Alaska, bison survived throughout the entire Holocene. They disappeared only in the historical period at the hands of human hunters. Alaskan native elders still tell stories that chronicle the taste of bison meat. Another indication that climate change has had little to do with the survival of bison is that in the past century, bison were brought back to Alaska, and they have been breeding there successfully. What's more, when musk oxen were reintroduced from the coldest, driest islands of the Canadian Arctic to Alaska in the 20th century, they immediately began to breed actively, even though the climate in Alaska was warmer and wetter. The same thing happened wherever musk oxen were reintroduced in Siberia. Even in the west Norwegian climate, musk oxen have prospered.The recent history of horses bolsters the case against climate change as the factor that destroyed the mammoth ecosystem and its diversity of large animals. In the Republic of Yakutia in northern Siberia, the biomass of horses is greater than that of reindeer. Although horses are classified as domesticated animals, in practice most of them are wild, living without any aid from people. Evidently, they are suited to the present climate.Yet, these great herbivores disappeared by the millions from northern Siberia and elsewhere. As has happened elsewhere and at other times, their vanishing coincides with the introduction by humans of new hunting technology. In Australia, 46,000 years ago, when people first arrived, 23 animal species vanished, all but one heavier than 45 kg (about 100 pounds). In America, 12,000 years ago, hunters began using small, sharp lances and arrowheads. After that, 70% of the large animal species vanished. By the time people started recording their own history, bison, aurochs, dziggetai (koulan), wild horses, saiga, and many other herbivores had already been exterminated from the steppes and prairies.Out to PastureJust as the great herbivore herds disappeared at the end of the Pleistocene, so did the northern grasslands that nurtured them. One possible explanation for this is simply that the cold, arid climate of the steppes changed into a humid one, turning the steppes into mossy tundra. However, the Holocene climate shift was not unique. Similar shifts occurred in previous interglacial periods, yet these did not cause catastrophic landscape reconstructions.During the last glacial, when mammoths still roamed on the steppes that covered Europe, the annual precipitation there was 200 to 250 mm, and January temperatures were in the range of -25 to 35C. Such climate conditions are similar to those of present-day northeastern Siberia. By many criteria, the present climate there is not humid, but rather is characteristic of an arid steppe. According to all weather stations of northeast Siberia, the annual radiation input is about twice what is necessary to evaporate the annual precipitation. This only adds to the mystery of why Siberia is no longer dominated by a grassy, steppe landscape.The physiological traits associated with Holocene vegetation partially explain the vegetation changes that coincided with loss of the Pleistocene megafauna. Plant transpiration accounts for most of the water loss from landscapes, and high transpiration rates are associated with more productive plants. Rates of water loss must therefore have been high in the north when productive Pleistocene meadow and steppe vegetation prevailed. As a result, vast amounts of water were sucked up from the ground, resulting in dry conditions, while the plants themselves sequestered nutrients to drive their own productivity.Holocene vegetation, in contrast, is dominated by unproductive moss and shrubs. This type of vegetation does not transpire enough moisture to dry out the soil. Moss does not even have roots. This leads to wet conditions conducive to the growth of mosses, which account for a substantial proportion of the northern Siberian biomass. Water-saturated soils inhibit decomposition of biomass and therefore the availability of nutrients to support plant growth. What's more, mosses insulate the ground efficiently--a 20-cm layer of moss prevents the underlying frozen soil from thawing. This also has the effect of sequestering nutrients and preventing their cycling through the ecosystem. All of these factors indicate that moss communities, once they are in place, create and sustain their own environment and do not depend so much on particular climate conditions.They are quite vulnerable to physical disturbance, however, and this is where their ecological connection to herbivores comes in.The Future of the PastWhen mosses are destroyed on loess soils, the site becomes overgrown with grasses within 1 to 2 years. The grasses then dry out the soil through their high transpiration rates, creating a steppe-like ecosystem. But when herbivore populations are low, grass productivity begins to decrease within a few years, because grass litter accumulates on the soil surface, shading and insulating the soil. In turn, soil fertility declines. As a result, shrubs and mosses, which have lower nutrient requirements than grasses, ultimately become dominant.    Figure 3 Pleistocene Park. This territory in the Republic of Yakutia is roughly an even split of meadow, larch forest, and willow shrubland. This Siberian region could become the venue for a reconstituted ecosystem that vanished 10,000 years ago.In the mammoth ecosystem, the collective behavior of millions of competitive herbivores maintained the grasslands. In the winter, the animals ate the grasses that grew the previous summer. All the while they fueled plant productivity by fertilizing the soil with their manure, and they trampled down moss and shrubs, preventing these plants from gaining a foothold. It is my contention that the northern grasslands would have remained viable in the Holocene had the great herds of Pleistocene animals remained in place to maintain the landscape.In the southern steppes, the situation is different. There, the warmer soil allows for more rapid decomposition of plant litter even in the absence of herbivores. In the north today, the soil is too cold to foster such decomposition, which means that the steppe ecosystem can be stable there only with the help of herbivores that decompose organic matter in their stomachs and that disturb mosses. Today's African savannas, in which trees and shrubs have supplanted grasses in much the same way that mossy tundra has supplanted grasses in Siberia, demonstrate this principle. These savannas would disappear without large herbivores, which are present there in large numbers. The large numbers of animals on African savannas amaze many people. However, similar animal densities exist in northern and middle latitudes. For example, at Elk Island National Park in Canada, about 60 bison browse on each square kilometer of grassland. The animal is much bigger than the gnus and zebra of Africa. Forests in the park are preserved only by strongly controlling the number of animals.This is why I believe that the changing climate of the Holocene would have had little bearing on the survival of the mammoth ecosystem. In some places, such as sandy and stony ground, trees and shrubs would have appeared. And that might have caused changes in the relative proportions of horses and moose. But overall, if climate were the only controlling factor, the total pasture productivity and the number of herbivores should have increased in the Holocene. Support for this view comes from the climate history that is chronicled in the Greenland ice sheet. It shows a sharp warming and dramatic increase of precipitation ~14,700 years ago, leading to conditions that resemble the present climate. Even so, in the north of Siberia, mammoth populations soared at this time.This view means that the present Holocene climate of northern Siberia, particularly near the present tree line, is likely just now to be optimal for the mammoth ecosystem. If we accept the argument that the pasture landscapes were destroyed because herbivore populations were decimated by human hunting, then it stands to reason that those landscapes can be reconstituted by the judicious return of appropriate herbivore communities.In northern Siberia, mainly in the Republic of Yakutia, plains that once were covered by tens of meters of mammoth steppe soils now occupy a million square kilometers. The climate of the territory is near optimal for northern grassland ecosystems. Thus, in principle, the ancient mammoth ecosystem could be restored there.In Yakutia, we are trying to do just that. The government has adopted a program to restore the republic's former biodiversity. One thrust of this effort has been through the nonprofit organization of Pleistocene Park--of which I am a founding member--on 160 km2 of Kolyma lowland. One-third of the territory is meadow, one-third is forest, and one-third is willow shrubland. Today, many of the animals of the mammoth ecosystem and grasses remain in northern Yakutia.Reindeer, moose, Yakutian horses, recently reintroduced musk oxen, hares, marmots, and ground squirrels forage for vegetation, and predators, including wolves, bears, lynxes, wolverines, foxes, polar foxes, and sables, prey on the herbivores. However, strong hunting pressure has kept the overall number of animals low. Therefore, their influence on vegetation is small. The first step for Pleistocene Park, which we are just now initiating, is to gather the surviving megafauna of the mammoth ecosystem (initially without predators) within the part of the parkland that is rich in grassland. The second step will be to increase the herbivore density sufficiently to influence the vegetation and soil. As animal densities increase, the fenced boundary will be expanded.The most important phase of the program will be the reintroduction of bison from Canada and subsequently, when the herbivores are sufficiently abundant, the acclimatization of Siberian tigers. In many regions of the Amur River basin, where this formidable predator survives, January temperature is as low as -25 to -30C. The tigers' survival there is limited more by poaching and herbivore density than by climate. Scientifically, Pleistocene Park is important because it directly tests the role of large herbivores in creating and maintaining grassland ecosystems, something that can only be surmised but not proven from the paleorecord.There is more than just scientific discovery at stake here. Northern Siberia will influence the character of global climate change. If greenhouse gas-induced warming continues, the permafrost will melt. At present, the frozen soils lock up a vast store of organic carbon. With an average carbon content of 2.5%, the soil of the mammoth ecosystem harbors about 500 gigatons of carbon, 2.5 times that of all rainforests combined. Moreover, this carbon is the relatively labile product of plant roots that were incorporated from productive steppe vegetation during the Pleistocene. As soon as the ice melts and the soil thaws, microbes will begin converting this long-sequestered soil carbon into carbon dioxide under aerobic conditions or into methane under anaerobic conditions. The release of these gases will only exacerbate and accelerate the greenhouse effect.Preventing this scenario from happening could be facilitated by restoring Pleistocene-like conditions in which grasses and their root systems stabilize the soil. The albedo--or ability to reflect incoming sunlight skyward--of such ecosystems is high, so warming from solar radiation also is reduced. And with lots of herbivores present, much of the wintertime snow would be trampled, exposing the ground to colder temperatures that prevent ice from melting. All of this suggests that reconstructed grassland ecosystems, such as the ones we are working on in Pleistocene Park, could prevent permafrost from thawing and thereby mitigate some negative consequences of climate warming.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7346<TEXT>The efforts of industrialized nations to cut smog pollution has had a bizarre side-effect - accelerating global warming.New data show that after years of getting smoggier, our skies have become clearer since about 1990. And one effect has been to allow more solar radiation to reach the surface of the Earth.The phenomenon known as global dimming has gone into reverse, according to research by Martin Wild at the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science in Zurich, Switzerland, and been replaced by global brightening (Science. vol 308, p 847). There is no longer a dimming to counteract the greenhouse effect, he told New Scientist.Climate scientists say there have been two critical influences on global air temperatures in the past half-century. First, rising atmospheric concentrations of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide have warmed the Earth, by preventing more of the heat that reaches the Earth's surface from escaping back into space.But a parallel increase in smog particles has shaded the planet, partly offsetting the warming. Past studies have shown an increase in average aerosol particle levels in the atmosphere between 1960 and 1990 that were sufficient to reduce solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface by about 5%.The net effect of these two conflicting influences has been a warming of almost 0.5 C since 1960. But the rising levels of aerosols have led to concern that they might be masking greater underlying warming. And now the mask appears to be coming off.Satellite corroborationWild's new data - assembled from measurements of surface radiation made round the globe - show a widespread reduction in aerosols in the atmosphere since around 1990. His findings are corroborated by satellite data reported by Rachel Pinker, a meteorologist at the University of Maryland at College Park, US, in the same issue of Science (v 308, p 850).The main cause of the global brightening, says Wild, is the clean-up of air pollution, especially in Europe and the former Soviet Union, where industrial decline has also played a role.But the same trend emerges in data from North America, Australasia, Japan and, most recently, in China, where smogs have been reduced despite swift industrialisation. The exceptions, where dimming continues to worsen, are mainly in South Asia and Africa.So should the world hurriedly reinstate smogs to stop global warming from accelerating? Probably not, as Wild points out that carbon dioxide lasts in the atmosphere for a century or more, whereas aerosols typically hang around for only a few days. So as carbon dioxide accumulates in future decades, we would need ever-thicker smogs to counteract it.And another Science paper reports that current smog levels kill half a million people worldwide each year from heart and lung diseases.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18624980.300-cycles-of-ice.html <TEXT>Like Ivor Williams (16 April, p 29), I was surprised to read William Connolley's claim (19 March, p 29) that no one had predicted an ice age some 30 years ago. But what has not been pointed out so far is that this prediction is compatible with the prediction of global warming. One model is cyclical, the other a trend, and trends and cycles are completely different animals. Both can be true. What happens in reality depends on the relative contributions of each to world temperature.The prediction of an imminent ice age was based on the observation that the world has been through a series of them. We are now in a warm patch, but the good times are almost over. This is a cycle, represented on a graph by a wiggly line. The global warming model is based on there having been an exogenous shock to the climate - that is, industrialisation. Industry has increased global temperatures, at first only marginally but increasingly over time. This is a trend, and is represented on a graph as a straight line.To find out which prediction will win out - the trend or the cycle - put both lines on the same graph and compare them with actual observations.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://environment.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg18624973.100-warmer-world-could-mean-failing-crops.html <TEXT>Predictions of a bumper world harvest in coming decades have been put on hold. That's because climate change is set to do much worse damage to global food production than even the gloomiest forecasts have so far predicted, according to studies presented on Tuesday and Wednesday at the Royal Society in London.The higher temperatures and more frequent droughts caused by climate change are widely expected to depress crop yields in many places, especially the tropics. But this ought to be offset by faster photosynthesis caused by rising atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, and laboratory tests had suggested that this beneficial effect could often dominate.No such luck, says Stephen Long, a crop scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. In open-field experiments with maize, rice, soybean and wheat he found that adding extra CO2 led to a beneficial effect only half as great as indicated by the lab experiments. Worse, when he added doses of ozone to the fields, to simulate the expected rise in ozone smogs due to higher temperatures, yields fell further. He says forecasters will need to make "a substantial downward revision of future global food production".</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_14_156/ai_56982347 <TEXT>A flight over the eastern portion of Antarctica crosses territory so monotonous it could lull an insomniac into unshakable slumber. For thousands of kilometers in all directions, a thick sheet of ice coats every bit of real estate, even the tips of the tallest peaks. Hour after hour, varying shades of white pass beneath the plane, with no hint of any other hue.Beneath the boring white blanket lies half a continent of virtually uncharted territory -- a terra nova so completely hidden that scientists have little clue what riches await discovery. Only 3 years ago, Russian and British glaciologists identified an immense lake--one of Earth's largest and deepest--buried beneath 4,000 meters of ice immediately below Russia's Vostok Station (SN: 6/29/96, p. 407).When the team announced the find, many other researchers sniffed that the lake was little more than a curiosity, says glaciologist Martin Siegert of the University of Bristol in England, one of the lake's discoverers. As more details have emerged, however, a growing number of scientists have picked up the scent, with dozens of investigators now panting to explore the feature, known as Lake Vostok."This is a very exciting opportunity to learn about our planet, the history of our planet, perhaps even analogues to life on other planets," says David Karl, a microbiologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu who co-chaired a conference last fall on Lake Vostok. "It was pretty amazing how uniform the interest is," he says.Cut off from the rest of Earth for a million years or more, Lake Vostok may harbor ancient species of microbes, unknown to science, that are able to withstand conditions at the edge of survivability. Moreover, a thick layer of sediment at the bottom of the lake could hold novel clues to the planet's climate going back tens of millions of years.The mysterious body of water inspires even otherworldly interest: NASA hopes to use the lake to test methods for detecting life on other planets.In August, the National Science Foundation--which runs U.S. operations in Antarctica -- decided that it would fund an airborne survey of the lake, a first step toward eventually drilling into the water. This week, some 60 scientists gathered in Cambridge, England, to start planning an international expedition to explore the lake and capture samples of its residents, if any exist.Along with the potential rewards come a host of challenges. Researchers must find a way to penetrate the icy covering without introducing any microorganisms or pollutants into the sealed-off water."We know absolutely nothing about sub-glacial lakes. If we're going to work on them, we must assume that we are going to take extreme measures to avoid any sort of contamination," says Cynan Ellis-Evans of the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, who led this week's meeting.Vostok Station holds the uncomfortable distinction of having recorded the coldest temperature on Earth. Thermometers there measured -89.6 C in July 1983, and the average temperature hovers down around -55 C.It's the thick ice, strangely, that enables a lake to survive in such a frozen environment. "The 3 kilometers or so of ice acts effectively as an insulating blanket that protects the bedrock underneath the ice from the cold temperatures above," says Siegert. Geothermal heat coming from the planet's interior keeps the lake from freezing and warms the lowest layers of ice.The tremendous weight of the ice sheet also plays a role in maintaining the lake. Beneath 4 km of glacier, the pressure is intense enough to melt ice at a temperature of -4 C.These factors have helped lakes develop across much of the thickly blanketed East Antarctica. To date, Siegert and his colleagues have detected more than 70 hidden lakes in the small portion of the continent they've examined so far.Lake Vostok is the largest of these, stretching 280 km from south to north and some 60 km from east to west, roughly the size of Lake Ontario but twice as deep. At the station, which sits at the southern end of the lake, the water depth appears to be 500 m, according to seismic experiments carried out by Russian researchers.The first clues to Lake Vostok's existence came in the 1970s, when British, U.S., and Danish researchers collected radar observations by flying over this region. The radar penetrates the ice and bounces off whatever sits below. When researchers found a surface as flat as a mirror, they surmised that a lake must exist underneath the ice. Gordon de Q. Robin of the University of Cambridge reported the subglacial water, but the data didn't reveal whether there was a single giant lake or several separate ones.It took a view from space to define the lake better. Using radar data collected by ERS-1 satellite measurements, J.K. Ridley of University College London found that ice was much smoother and flatter above the lake than it was above the surrounding mountainous regions. In 1993, he charted the northern end of the lake, but the available data did not resolve the southern portion near Vostok Station.Three years later, Siegert analyzed an improved set of satellite radar data without ever setting foot on the Antarctic continent. Along with Robin, Ridley, and other researchers, Siegert fully mapped out the dimensions of the lake using the satellite, radar, and seismic measurements.Only then--some 20 years after it was first suspected -- did the lake start to garner attention outside the narrow field of glaciology. When Nature splashed the news of Vostok on its cover in 1996, biologists started wondering whether the buried lake could harbor exotic new species.At the time that people first found hints of Lake Vostok, there was little reason to suspect it might harbor any life. "The most exciting advance since the 1970s is the understanding that life on this planet can occur, and indeed thrive, in extremely difficult environments," Siegert says.---If microbes do populate the lake, they may be some of the hungriest organisms ever discovered. "Lake Vostok has the potential to be one of the most energy-limited, or oligotropic, environments on the planet," says microbiologist Edward F. DeLong of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Moss Landing, Calif.For the lake's residents, the only hope for a sizable meal would come from below. Russian investigators have speculated that the lake floor has hot springs spewing out hydrothermal fluids stocked with reduced metals and other sorts of chemical nutrients.They base their argument on the shape of the lake. Its elongated outline and substantial depth resemble Lake Baikal in Siberia, which sits in a geologically active rift zone. At this site, Earth's outer shell is pulling apart, allowing molten rock to rise close to the surface and feed hydrothermal springs.Geologists, however, have always painted the exact opposite picture of East Antarctica. The scant geological evidence available for this region indicates that the crust is old and dead.Without a stream of nutrients seeping up from the deep Earth, the only potential source of energy lies above the lake. The ice sheet above the water is creeping from west to east at a rate of roughly 4 m per year. The lowermost layers of ice melt when they come in contact with the lake, liberating trapped gases and bits of crushed-up rock.Indirect evidence for this glacially slow delivery system comes from drilling operations at Vostok Station, where Russian and French researchers have pulled up cylindrical ice samples--about as wide as a coffee can--of ice down to within 120 m of the lake surface. In January 1998, the team ceased its work to prevent contaminating the lake with the diesel fuel used to lubricate the drill.In the lowest part of the hole, the scientists found a 200-m-thick layer of ice containing giant crystals. This and other properties indicate that the ice formed as the lake water froze to the bottom of the glacier. Researchers suspect that the bottommost ice melts as it passes over the western edge of the lake and then water freezes onto the ice sheet as it moves over the eastern portion of the lake underlying Vostok Station.What comes out of the melting ice is guesswork at the moment because geologists know so little about East Antarctica. If the glacier recently passed over sedimentary rock before reaching the lake, it could be supplying organic compounds useful to microorganisms.It also could be seeding the lake with a continuous source of new residents. S.S. Abyzov of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow has found bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, and even pollen grains in the Vostok ice core down to depths of 2,750 m--three-quarters of the way to the bottom. At least some of these organisms are alive and capable of growing, he reported last year.Karl is currently examining ice from the 3,600-meter depth for signs of viable microbes. Because ice from that depth formed from frozen lake water, it contains a sample of whatever was floating at the surface of the lake. The results from this analysis may indirectly indicate whether anything survives in the lightless body of water.---If denizens of Lake Vostok don't succumb for lack of food, they could easily suffocate. Because of the intense weight bearing down from the ice sheet above--340 times atmospheric pressure--the water contains almost no dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, or other gases.According to calculations, gas molecules should reside in crystal cages of ice, forming a structure called a clathrate. Some of these may create a slushy zone floating at the top of the lake, while others could sink to the floor.Despite the apparent odds against life, biologists place their bets on the bacteria. "I would be surprised if there were no microbes in Vostok rather than the other way around," says Karl.What excites researchers is the idea that resources in the lake are not evenly distributed. Microorganisms, just like any business, tend to exploit inequalities in supply and demand. By living on the border between two environments, cells can extract energy as materials move from regions of plenty to paucity. For instance, bacteria may well thrive on the surface of the clathrates, taking advantage of a gradient in methane concentrations.Clathrates have also captured the attention of climate scientists because they may contain ancient samples of oxygen and other gases, says glaciologist Todd A. Sowers of Pennsylvania State University in State College. The frozen cages of gas could have built up on the lake bottom, layer by layer, over a million years or more. By looking at the ratio of different oxygen isotopes in these clathrates, scientists should be able to trace how Earth's temperature has changed since the time that some of the earliest humans were spreading across the world.Below the clathrate layers, Lake Vostok apparently holds vast sedimentary deposits chronicling tens of millions of years of Antarctic geology. The Russian seismic experiments indicate that sedimentary layers extend hundreds of meters below the lake floor.---In many ways, however, the bottom of Lake Vostok is even more remote than the surface of Mars.To study the lake's sediments, scientists need to drill through the ice, sterilize the probe before entering the lake, pass the instrument through hundreds of meters of lake water, bore into the sediments below, then pull the samples back up through the ice. All this at crushing pressures.The constraints steer engineers in opposite directions, says Joan Horvath, a project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, who's developing plans for Lake Vostok. "To get anything through the ice, you want it to be small," she says. "However, once you get a submersible down there, it's very difficult to get something small that will operate at high pressure. In that environment, you like things to have thick walls. So, there is an inherent engineering mismatch between the two things you're trying to do."Most concepts for a first Vostok mission don't involve collecting samples. A simpler plan calls for melting a hole through the ice and then sending a robotic submersible into the lake to analyze the water and search for hydrothermal vents. The hole would refreeze almost instantly, so the trapped instrument would send back information via a cable running up through the ice.NASA has expressed interest in Lake Vostok because of its similarity to Europa. This moon of Jupiter appears to have a water ocean covered by a thick ice sheet, measuring perhaps tens of kilometers in depth. If hydrothermal vents roil away beneath the ice, chemical reactions on Europa could have created the molecular building blocks for life, if not life itself (see p. 219 and SN: 11/7/98, p. 296).Vostok would be an ideal testing ground for technology that would eventually fly to Europa or places even more distant, say many scientists. "If we want to be able to search for life on other planets, this [Vostok mission] would be a drop in the bucket," says Sowers.Though cheap compared with a Europan mission, any expedition to Vostok would represent a significant investment. Participants at the meeting this week in Cambridge discussed ways to harness support from many nations for a mission.Researchers also debated whether it makes sense to focus on Lake Vostok to the exclusion of other ice-covered Antarctic lakes. "I'm not convinced at all that Vostok is the best place to drill," says Siegert.Part of the problem is Vostok Station. U.S. officials are reluctant to use the aging outpost because of environmental and safety hazards there, so any expedition would have to set up a camp elsewhere on the lake. According to Siegert, "it may be sensible to drill down into a subglacial lake [that] is located quite close to a serviceable station. And also one that's relatively small so that if it's spoiled in some way, it won't be the best example of a subglacial lake."Siegert and others have pointed out that a lake lies almost directly beneath the station run by the United States at the South Pole. Because of the facilities already there, a drilling operation near the South Pole would cost less than at the remote Vostok site.Yet the size of Lake Vostok gives it some unique advantages. Shallower lakes may have frozen in the past few hundred thousand years, during spells when the ice sheet was thinner, says Robin Bell, a geophysicist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y."Since Vostok is so deep, it's very unlikely that it has frozen solid since the ice sheet was built," says Bell, who cochaired last November's Vostok workshop at the National Science Foundation.The agency recently decided to fund Bell's proposal to complete an airborne survey of Lake Vostok, which will help answer whether Earth's crust is currently tearing apart there. Bell views the agency's action as a symbol of its growing interest in sampling the lake. She says, "This isn't going to guarantee that they're going to go the whole way, but without this they weren't going to do anything."Future missions depend in part on what Bell finds in the next 2 years while flying a gridlike pattern of traverses over the endless white expanse near Vostok Station. Despite the blankness of the surface ice, though, the geophysicist will have little trouble staying awake as her instruments plumb the depths of the alien lake below.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/seasons_orbit.php<TEXT>We have all been taught that the seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation - the 23.4  offset of the axis from a direction perpendicular to the Earth's orbital plane. The direction of the rotational axis stays nearly fixed in space, even as the Earth revolves around the Sun once each year. As a result, when the Earth is at a certain place in its orbit, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun and experiences summer. Six months later, when the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun, the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun and experiences winter. The seasons are, of course, reversed for the southern hemisphere.The solstices mark the two dates during the year on which the Earth's position in its orbit is such that its axis is most directly tilted either toward or away from the Sun. These are the dates when the days are longest for the hemisphere tilted toward the Sun (where it is summer) and shortest for the opposite hemisphere (where it is winter).However, there is a complication. The Earth's orbit is very close to being a perfect circle, but not quite. It is somewhat elliptical, which means that the distance between the Earth and the Sun varies over the course of the year. This effect is too weak to cause the seasons, but it might have some influence over their severity. The remainder of this page explains this possibilty.The Earth reaches perihelion - the point in its orbit closest to the Sun - in early January, only about two weeks after the December solstice. Thus winter begins in the northern hemisphere at about the time that the Earth is nearest the Sun. Is this important? Is there a reason why the times of solstice and perihelion are so close? It turns out that the proximity of the two dates is a coincidence of the particular century we live in. The date of perihelion does not remain fixed, but, over very long periods of time, slowly regresses (moves later) within the year. There is some evidence that this long-term change in the date of perihelion influences the Earth's climate.We can measure the length of the year in several different ways. The length of the year from equinox to equinox (equivalently, solstice to solstice) is called the tropical year, and its length is the basis for our Gregorian (civil) calendar. Basically, the tropical year is the year of a complete cycle of seasons, so it is natural that we use it for ordinary purposes. But we can also measure the length of the year from perihelion to perihelion, which is called the anomalistic year. On average, the anomalistic year is about 25 minutes longer than the tropical year, so the date of perihelion slowly shifts over time, regressing by about 1 full day every 58 years. The date of perihelion thus moves completely through the tropical year in about 21,000 years.It is important to note that we are talking about long-term trends here. There are small year-to-year variations in the dates and times of solstice and perihelion due to our leap-year cycle and the effect of the Moon on the motion of the Earth. See our page on Earth's Seasons for the exact dates and times of these events for current years.Most of the difference in the average lengths of the two kinds of year is due to the very slight change in the direction of the Earth's rotation axis in space from one year to another. We usually think of the Earth's axis as being fixed in direction - after all, it always seems to point toward Polaris, the North Star. But the direction is not quite constant: the axis does move, at a rate of a little more than a half-degree per century. So Polaris has not always been, and will not always be, the pole star. For example, when the pyramids were built, around 2500 BCE, the pole was near the star Thuban (Alpha Draconis). This gradual change in the direction of the Earth's axis, called precession, is caused by gravitational torques exerted by the Moon and Sun on the spinning, slightly oblate Earth.Because the direction of the Earth's axis determines when the seasons will occur, precession will cause a particular season (for example, northern hemisphere winter) to occur at a slightly different place in the Earth's orbit from year to year. At the same time, the orbit itself is subject to small changes, called perturbations. The Earth's orbit is an ellipse, and there is a slow change in its orientation, which gradually shifts the point of perihelion in space. The two effects - the precession of the axis and the change in the orbit's orientation - work together to shift the seasons with respect to perihelion. Thus, since we use a calendar year that is aligned to the occurrence of the seasons, the date of perihelion gradually regresses through the year. It takes 21,000 years to make a complete cycle of dates.We would not expect the 21,000-year cycle to be very important climatologically because the Earth's orbit is almost circular - the distance to the Sun at perihelion is only about 3% less than its distance at aphelion. That is, whether perihelion occurs in January or July, it seems unlikely that our seasons would be much affected. At least, that is the case now; but the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit (how elliptical it is) also changes over very long periods of time, from almost zero (circular orbit) to about three times its current value. The eccentricity of the orbit varies periodically with a time scale of about 100,000 years. So, it would be reasonable to suppose that if the 21,000-year perihelion shift cycle were to have any effect on climate at all, it would only be during the more widely-spaced epochs when the orbital eccentricity was relatively large. That is, climatologically, the 100,000-year cycle of eccentricity should modulate the 21,000-year cycle of perihelion.In fact, Mars has an orbit much more eccentric than the Earth's, and its perihelion cycle (which has a period of 51,000 years) does apparently have a significant effect on climate and prevailing wind direction there.There is another important cycle that has the potential to affect the Earth's climate; it is a 41,000-year variation in obliquity, the tilt of the Earth's axis with respect to a direction perpendicular to its orbital plane. This variation is different from precession - the two motions are at right angles to each other - and astronomically is a much smaller effect. The obliquity varies by only a few degrees back and forth, and the current value of 23.4  is near the middle of the range. However, climatologically, the obliquity variation has the potential to have a fairly direct effect on seasonal extremes. After all, it is the obliquity that causes our seasons in the first place - if the Earth's axis were perpendicular to its orbital plane, there would be no seasons at all.The astronomical cycles described above are called Milankovitch cycles after Milutin Milankovitch, a Serbian scientist who provided a detailed theory of their potential influence over climate in the 1920s. Milankovitch's work was an attempt at explaining the ice ages, and it built upon previous astronomical theories of climate variation postulated by Joseph Adhemar and James Croll in the 19th century. Although the Milankovitch theory is well-grounded astronomically, it remains controversial. The theory predicts different effects at different latitudes, and thus its use as a predictor of global (or at least hemispheric) climate change is not unambiguous. The exact mechanisms by which the relatively modest variations in the Earth's orbit and axis direction might result in such large effects as the ice ages are not well established. The theory's popularity has tended to vary depending on the type of long-term climatological data that has been available and the method used to establish a time scale for the data.The 21,000-year perihelion cycle and the 41,000-year obliquity cycle do in fact appear to be present in the climatological record. But the dominant climate cycle that is seen has a period of about 100,000 years. Although this coincides with the period of change in the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit, the theory outlined above does not predict that we should see this period directly - the effect of eccentricity should appear only as a modulation of the 21,000-year perihelion cycle. The mechanism by which the Earth's orbital eccentricity could affect the climate in such a direct and important way is not known, although recent evidence (published in 2000) indicates that atmospheric carbon dioxide may play a leading role in amplifying the orbital effect. However, some researchers still have doubts about the association between the 100,000-year climate cycle and orbital variations. Thus, many questions remain about long-term climate variations and their relationship, if any, to astronomical causes.A very readable book on the whole subject of ice ages and the development of the astronomical theories for their origin is Ice Ages: Solving the Mystery by John Imbrie and Katherine Palmer Imbrie (1979, Enslow Publishers, New Jersey). The book obviously does not cover the latest research, but provides an excellent background and historical context.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://starryskies.com/solar_system/Earth/reasons_for_seasons.html <TEXT>We call an imaginary line running through the Earth from pole to pole, that Earth's axis. We say that the Earth spins on its axis, one spin being 1 day. But the Earth's axis is not perpendicular to the plane of the solar system. Instead, it is tilted 23.5 degrees. It is this tilt that provides us with seasonal changes. The best way to understand it is to understand the effects as we see them from Earth.     Observers in North America notice that the Sun is higher in the sky in summer than in winter. These changes in position result from an apparent motion of the Sun north and south of the celestial equator (a projection of the Earth's equator into space.) This apparent motion is the result of that 23.5 degree axial tilt.     On the Autumn and Spring Equinoxes the Sun crosses the celestial equator. One these days there is an equal amount of day and night. The Sun rises due east and sets due west.     As the summer solstice approaches on June 21st, the days get longer and the Sun rises higher in the sky at noon. It is also rising and setting further north of east and west. At this time, the northern hemisphere is pointing toward the Sun.     As the winter solstice approaches on December 21st, the days are shorter and the Sun is lower in the sky at noon. The sun is also rising and setting south of east and west. During this time, the Earth is pointed away from the Sun.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://earthstorm.mesonet.org/materials/ref_seasons.php <TEXT>All of the earth's weather results from the fact that the atmosphere is unequally heated by the sun.

These satellites are launched into orbits at high inclinations to the Earth's rotation (at low angles with longitude lines), such that they pass across high latitudes near the poles. Most POES orbits are circular to slightly elliptical at distances ranging from 700 to 1700 km (435 - 1056 mi) from the geoid.

For many years, people pondered this same question, and it took humankind until the 1500s to finally figure it all out. The solution, it turns out, is as simple as the Earth orbiting the Sun. Almost every person born since the Civil War has known this since he (or she) was a child, but still, just because the Earth goes 'round the sun, this does not imply that seasons should necessarily occur; there's something a little more complex than just the orbit of the Earth involved. This section of the tutorial shall examine how it all works, and why, exactly, there are seasons.A few terms you ought to knowEquinox    * A time at which the days and nights are the same length around the world.    * Occurs around March 21 and September 21 (but not necessarily on those dates).    * Occurs when the Sun is directly over the equator.    * Is either vernal (in the spring) or autumnal (in the fall).Solstice    * A time at which either day or night is the longest it will be during the year.    * Occurs around June 21 and December 20 (but not necessarily on those dates).    * Goes simply by winter or summer solstice.    * Occurs when the sun is directly above 23.5 N latitude (Summer Solstice) or 23.5 S latitude (Winter Solstice).    * Will allow one pole to have 24 hours of daylight, while the other pole has a 24 hour night.The Axis of the EarthThe Earth spins on its axis, an invisible line through the center of the Earth. The northernmost point of this axis is the North Pole. The southernmost point, therefore, is the South Pole. The Equator is an invisible line that encircles the widest point of the Earth, and is equidistant from either pole at every point; that is to say, the Equator is the same distance away from each pole at every point along it.The Earth rotates along the plane of the equator, meaning that the Earth spins in a circle represented by the equator, or any latitude line, for that matter. (It wobbles a little, actually, but it's such a small wobble that it really doesn't matter much unless you're thinking in terms of 26,000 years at a time.) If you stood out in space so that you could look down over the North Pole, you would notice that the Earth spins counterclockwise, which makes sense if you consider that the sun rises in the East and sets in the West.North Polar and Equatorial views of Earth and Solar BeamsThe interesting thing about all this is that, even though the Earth rotates on the plane of the equator, the Sun doesn't always follow the equatorial path. In fact, the plane that the Sun appears to follow as Earth rotates is dependent upon the time of the year. It's a little tough to grasp at first, but it's this tilt that gives us the seasons.Earth's axis tilt and equatorial plane compared with its plane of orbitEven atmospheric scientists have trouble with this concept at first, so don't be discouraged.

The basic concept can be illustrated through demonstration and/or discussion of how it feels warmer in the sun versus the shade. Thermometers can be placed in the sun versus the shade to show that the one exposed to sunlight reads a higher temperature than the one in the shade. This can also be done by exposing one thermometer to light from a light bulb and keeping another in just normal room light to show that the one lighted by the bulb shows a higher temperature.    The amount of heating depends on the time of exposure as can be demonstrated by watching the change of temperature with time as it is exposed to light or by exposing thermometers to light for varying amounts of time. The amount of heating is also dependent on the angle with which the light strikes a surface as will be explored in the next section. Other factors that affect heating such as land versus water will not be covered in detail on this page. Experiments with heating soil or water with sunlight or lamplight and measuring temperature changes can also be done to relate to observations more directly to the earth.    2) The earth is almost a sphere.    The fact that the earth is almost a sphere (except for a slight bulge at the equator and flattening at the poles and surface features) is important to many related features of temperatures on the earth; the seasons, the fact that the polar regions are colder than near the equator, the changes in temperature and sun position throughout a day.    Light Patch on a Globe    Consequences of the earth's spericity can be demonstrated using a globe and a light source that produces a small beam. A large ball can be used instead of a globe, but a globe is more effective for relating the observations to the earth. A very effective light source is an overhead projector with the glass covered with paper with a square hole cut out to block out all of the light except a square patch. One can also use a flashlight if the beam is sufficiently focused. If using a flashlight, be sure to hold it so that the beam is always parallel to the table.    Align the globe and light so that the patch of light is centered on the globe. Move the globe or light source so that the light patch moves up and down on the globe and side to side on the globe. Note that the farther the light patch gets from the central portion of the globe the more elongated it gets. Near the central portion, the shape is more square (or circular if using a flashlight).     What does this mean? A certain amount of light is coming through the square hole (or from the flashlight) and reaching the globe. When the light patch is hitting the central part of the globe and is the smallest (most square or most circular in the case of a flashlight) that amount of light is concentrated in a small area. The light is striking the globe perpendicularly, i.e. a line from the light source to the patch would be perpendicular to the globe surface at the location of the light patch. If you imagined yourself standing on the globe at that point, you would have to look directly overhead to see the light source (sun).    As you move the light away from the central portion of the globe the same amount of light from the light source is now spread over a greater area. This means that now each location within the lighted patch receives a smaller portion of the light in the total patch. As an analogy think about spreading a certain amount of jelly on one slice of toast versus two slices of toast. Imaging taking one of the small containers of jelly that restaurants provide and spreading the entire contents on one slice of toast. Now think about the same amount of jelly on two slices of toast. In the second case each slice of toast will get less jelly than the single piece of toast in the first case. In this analogy the jelly represents the light coming through the hole (or from the flashlight). The toast represents the amount of surface over which the light is spread. The case with one slice of toast represents the case in which the light is hitting the central portion of the globe perpendicularly and the light hits a relatively small area. The case with two slices of toast represents a case when the light hits a part of the globe away from the central portion and hence is more spread out. In the second case each piece of toast now receives a smaller portion of the jelly than did the single piece just as each location in the spread out light patch receives a smaller portion of the total light in the whole patch. (Note: This analogy was adapted from a suggestion by a QUEST 2000 participant as an improvement on a previous analogy I had used.)    Why is the patch more spread out? Notice that the angle between the globe surface and the light beam changes as you move the patch away from the central portion of the globe due to the curvature of the globe. If you imagine standing on the globe away from the central portion, you would not have to look strait up to see the light source (sun). The light source (sun) would look lower in your "sky". The light is now striking the surface at a lower angle than perpendicular. The lower the angle, the more the light is spread out.    To illustrate this further use a long piece of white cardboard in front of the globe. First hold the cardboard so that it is perpendicular to the light beam. This represents the surface of the globe in the central portion. The light should form a square patch (or roughly circular if using a flashlight). Now gradually tilt the cardboard (i.e. hold the card in the middle of one of the vertical edges and tilt the card so the top is tilted away from the light source and the bottom is tilted toward the light source). Notice that the light patch becomes more elongated just as it did on the globe when you moved the light patch away from the central portion that you started with using the light. Both on the globe and on the cardboard the light patch becomes more elongated as the light hits the surface at a lower and lower angle.    Shadows    Another observable consequence of the angle with which light strikes the surface is in the lengths of shadows produced. By using a toy figure or small sticks with globe or cardboard and the light source you can see that lower angles of light produce longer shadows.    Measuring Temperature    The temperature affects of the angle with which light strikes a surface can be demonstrated using a lamp that can direct light and two thermometers with the bulbs covered in dark cardboard, paper or cloth to create a relatively flat surface covering the bulb. Direct the lamp downward. Place one thermometer flat on top of a white piece of paper on the table below the lamp. The dark surface of this thermometer should receive light from the lamp perpendicularly. Placing the second thermometer next to the first, support the second so that the flat surface covering the bulb received light at a very low angle. The two black surfaced should be not quite perpendicular to each other. Turn on the lamp and periodically record the temperatures on the two thermometers. The horizontal thermometer should show a higher temperature than the tilted thermometer since the light striking the surface covering the tilted thermometer bulb should be more spread out than light striking the surface covering the horizontal thermometer bulb.    As stated earlier the spherical shape of the earth (and the effects on how light hits and is spread over surfaces on different parts of the earth) helps explain a number of things. The poles are colder than the equator because the poles tend to receive light at a lower angle (and sometimes not at all as seen in the next section) than the equator. Mid-day tends to be warmer than dawn or dusk because the latter times receive sunlight at a lower angle than at mid-day. Remember that as a point on the earth rotates from west to east, the sun is low in the sky in the morning, moves higher toward mid-day and then becomes lower in the sky toward sunset. You will also see longer shadows near dawn or dusk than at mid-day. The spherical shape of the earth is also important to understanding seasons, but now we must include the next concept.    3) The earth rotates on an axis that is tilted relative to the path the earth takes around the sun. The earth's rotation axis maintains a constant orientation relative to the distant stars and hence its orientation relative to the sun in an annual cycle.    This is the key to the seasons. To understand why use a globe with the light source that makes a small patch of light. For students the globes can be modified with markers or pieces of tape to highlight the equator and 45-degrees (or 40-degrees) North and South latitudes. The choice of latitudes might depend on the latitude lines that are shown. Some globes use 15-degree intervals while others use 10-degrees. 40-degrees is near to our latitude in New Jersey.    Moving Globes (Very Important)    First it is important to understand and physically demonstrate the earth's rotation and how the rotating earth travels around the sun. The globes used and most globes that are designed to rotate have the rotation axis tilted by 23.5 degrees relative to a vertical line. Pick an imaginary sun to move the globe around. Move the globe in a roughly circular path around the "sun" so that the rotation axis always points in the same direction relative to the sides of the room. The north pole will always be pointing toward same general area of the ceiling. This will result in the north pole being inclined toward the sun on one side of its orbit and away from the sun on the opposite side. Between the two extremes the north pole is inclined neither toward nor away from the sun. On the time scales important to the seasons, the earth's rotation axis maintains a constant orientation relative to distant stars. The north pole of the real earth always points toward Polaris (the North Star) at the present time. The orientation of the earth's axis does vary with periods of 10's of thousands of years which is important to ice ages, but not to the seasons that we experience.    Position the globe so that the north pole is inclined most directly toward the "sun". This represents the summer solstice for the northern hemisphere. Note that the south pole is inclined away from the sun, so this position represents the winter solstice for the southern hemisphere. This occurs on June 21 or 22.    Move the globe in a counter clockwise direction (when viewed from above) one quarter of the way around its roughly circular path, keeping the north pole oriented in the same direction relative to the features of the room. Now you have reached a position in which neither pole is inclined toward or away from the sun. This represents the orientation of the earth at the autumnal equinox in the northern hemisphere and the spring (vernal) equinox in the southern hemisphere on September 22 or 23.    Continue the globe another quarter of the way around its path keeping the north pole oriented in the same direction relative to the features of the room. Now the north pole is inclined the most away from the sun. This position represents the winter solstice for the northern hemisphere and the summer solstice for the southern hemisphere on December 21 or 22.    One more quarter of the way around brings us to another position in which neither pole is inclined toward or away from the sun. This represents the orientation of the earth at the spring (vernal) equinox in the northern hemisphere and the autumnal equinox in the southern hemisphere on March 21 or 22.    The solstices and equinoxes are generally described as the first days of each of the seasons: summer solstice called the first day of summer, autumnal equinox the first day of fall, winter solstice the first day of winter, and vernal equinox the first day of spring. In terms of climate it is probably more accurate to describe summer in the northern hemisphere as the months of June, July and August (JJA_, fall as September, October, November (SON), winter as December, January, February (DJF), and spring as March, April, May (MAM). In the southern hemisphere the seasons are offset by six months from the northern hemisphere.    Tilted Globes and Light Patch    How does this tilt of the rotation axis result in the seasons? Position the globe relative to the light source with the small patch so that the globe is in the northern summer solstice position, i.e. the north pole inclined most toward the light source. Move the globe or the light source up and down through the central portion of the globe to show how the light patch changes to the north and south. You should see that through much of the northern hemisphere the light patch stays fairly small, whereas in the southern hemisphere the light patch is more spread out and does not even reach the regions around the south pole. Compare for example the light patch size and shape at 45-degrees north, the equator and 45-degrees south. You should see that at both 45-degrees north and at the equator the light patch is fairly small, while at 14-degrees south, the light patch is quite elongated. At this time of year the sun is higher in the sky in the northern hemisphere and lower in the southern hemisphere resulting in more heating in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere where the light is more spread out. This results in summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.    Now position the globe to the light source to represent the northern winter solstice and southern solstice, i.e. the north pole inclined most away from the light source and the south pole inclined most toward the light source. Moving the position of the light patch you should now see the opposite of the previous case. The light patch remains small through much of the southern hemisphere while in the northern hemisphere the light patch is elongated and does not even reach the north polar regions. The patch is now similar at 45-degrees south and the equator, but quite elongated at 45-degrees north. At this time of year the sun is higher in the sky in the southern hemisphere and lower in the northern hemisphere where the light is more spread out. This results in summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the northern hemisphere.    Finally, position the globe relative to the light source to represent on of the equinoxes, i.e. neither pole is inclined toward or away from the light source. Now the light patch should spread the same way both north and south of the equator as you move the patch away from the equator. Both hemispheres should receive the same distribution of light and this is characteristic of both equinoxes.    Remember that the importance of the tilt of the earth's rotation axis is in how it affects the spread of light in different hemispheres and not in how near or far each hemisphere is from the sun. The earth has a radius of about 4000 miles compared to an average distance from the sun of 93,000,000 miles. If you represent the distance between the earth and the sun as 93 yards of a football field, the radius of the earth would only be 1/7 of an inch. Thus the winter and summer hemispheres are not appreciably different in distance from the sun.    These relationships can be further explored using the cardboard cross section of the earth that can be rotated relative to the lines representing the sun's rays. Note that the central heavy line with the arrow strikes the circle perpendicularly so at that point at noon the sun would be directly overhead and hence would receive the most concentrated sunlight from the sun (ignoring clouds). The amount that the light is spread out over the surface can be understood by looking at the distance along the circle that separates the points at which two neighboring lines (light rays) intercept the circle. The farther you go from the central heavy line the greater the distance between points where neighboring light rays reach the circle. This can be related to how the light patch lengthened as you moved the patch away from the central part of the globe.    Turn the circle representing the earth so that the right end of the Tropic of Cancer line touches the arrow point on the central ray of the sun. This represents the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere and the winter solstice in the southern hemisphere. The Tropic of Cancer is at 23.5-degrees North latitude. Note that on the Tropic of Cancer at noon light rays are perpendicular to the surface and the sun would be directly overhead. As was seen with the light patch on the globe, the sunlight strikes most of the northern hemisphere at a higher angle than in the southern hemisphere and hence is less spread out and causing greater warming in the northern hemisphere. Also note that all points north of the Arctic Circle (66.5-degrees North - 23.5-degrees) receive sunlight while all points south of the Antarctic Circle (66.5-degrees South) are in darkness. This will be considered further when we explore day length in the next activity.    If you turn the circle so that the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5-degrees South) is lined up with the heavy arrow the opposite situation is illustrated. We are now showing the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere and the summer solstice in the southern hemisphere. The sun is directly overhead at noon on the Tropic of Capricorn. The sun's rays strike the surface at a higher angle in the southern hemisphere that in the northern hemisphere so there the light is more concentrated and causes greater heating in the southern hemisphere. Now all points north of the Arctic Circle are in darkness and all points south of the Antarctic Circle receive light.    Now turn the circle so the equator is lined up with the heavy arrow. This represents the two equinoxes. Sunlight is symmetrically distributed between the two hemispheres.     The cardboard model also shows one other reason for differences in heating at different latitudes. A circle representing an exaggerated atmosphere is shown. On the scale of this model the atmosphere would mainly be contained within less than the thickness of the line that makes the circle. The atmosphere is shown in this way to demonstrate that light represented by the thick arrow passes through less atmosphere than the light represented by other rays. The farther away from that central point, the greater thickness of the atmosphere through which the light must pass. Light passing through the atmosphere can be reflected, scattered, or absorbed thus reducing the amount that actually reaches the ground. The more atmosphere through which light has to pass, the less will make it to the ground. That is why you can safely look at the sun at sunset and sunrise, but not in the middle of the day. You can see from the model that wherever the light strikes the surface at a low angle and hence spreads over a large surface it also has passed through a greater thickness of atmosphere. The passage through the atmosphere also contributes to the reduction in heating of the surface, but is a much smaller effect than the spreading of the light over a greater surface.    Shadows Revisited    An observable consequence of the changing height of the sun through the seasons is the change in the lengths of the shadows at noon. If you keep track of the shadows produced by a particular object, you should see that it casts a much longer noontime shadow in winter than in summer (keeping account of the shift in time due to daylight savings time). This is an observation that could be made once a week during the school year and graphed.    Hours of Daylight    There is another important way in which the tilt of the earth's axis contributes to the seasons. That is the variation in hours of daylight with latitude at different times of the year. This can also be illustrated with the globes.    The globes used has a 15-degree interval between longitude lines. In this case each longitude line represents 1 hour of turning of the earth. A full circle is 360-degrees. 360-degrees divided by 24 hours gives 15-degrees of rotation per hour. This each longitude line represents 1 hour. For students these can be highlighted at certain latitudes (eg. 45-degrees North and South and the equator) using a marker or pieces of tape. If you use globes with a 10-degree interval between lines you would probably need to mark 24 dots equally spaced around each of 40-degree North latitude, the equator and 40-degrees South latitude. Drafting tape can be used for the dots so that they could be easily removed and not leave residue. The dots would be separated by 15-degrees of latitude so you can use the longitude lines on the globe to place the dots.    Using a slide projector, an overhead projector or a lamp shine the full beam on the globe so that all of one side of the globe is illuminates. Orient the globe in the position of the northern hemisphere summer solstice (north pole inclined toward the light source, south pole away). Count the number of longitude lines (or dots) on the lighted side at each latitude. Ideally, you should get about 15 at 45-degrees North, 12 at the equator and 9 at 45-degrees South (give or take one). You should see that more longitude lines (or dots) are lighted at 45-degrees North than the equator which has more lighted than 45-degrees South. This means that there are more hours of daylight at 45-degrees North than at the equator which has more than 45-degrees South on the northern summer solstice.    Also note that the north pole is lighted and the south pole is in darkness. Although it may be hard to see, all points north of the Arctic Circle would be lighted throughout the day (rotate the globe to see that) and all points south of the Antarctic Circle would be in darkness throughout the 24 hours of rotation on that date. Note how this related to the cardboard model. On this date there are 24 hours of daylight north of the Arctic Circle and 24 of darkness south of the Antarctic Circle.    Move the globe to the position of the northern hemisphere winter solstice (north pole inclined most away from the light, south pole toward the light). Now you should count roughly 9 lighted longitude lines (or dots) at 45-degrees north, 12 at the equator, and 15 at 45-degrees South. Day lengths are longer in the southern hemisphere and shorter in the northern hemisphere. On this date there are 24 hours of daylight south of the Antarctic Circle and 24 hours of darkness north of the Arctic Circle. Note that in both of these cases there are 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness at the equator.    Now move the globe to the position of one of the equinoxes (neither pole inclined toward or away from the light). Now you should count 12 hours of daylight at all three latitudes. As a matter of fact every location on the globe except right at the poles should have 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness on the days of the equinoxes. Day length changes continuously between the extremes of the solstices and the intermediate equinoxes. The solstices represent the shortest and longest periods of daylight.    Length of daylight and its changes also varies with latitude. Within the Arctic and Antarctic Circles long periods of daylight and darkness can exist. At the poles daylight and darkness both last for six months. At 70-degrees latitude a two month period of continuous daylight exists beginning about one month before the summer solstice and ending about one month after the solstice when daylight periods shorten (with sunrises and sunsets each calendar day) to 12 hours by the autumn equinox and continue to shorten until two months of darkness occur beginning about one month before the winter solstice. Between the Arctic and Antarctic Circles the daily sunrise and sunset times vary, with the most dramatic variations occurring farther from the equator.    Sunrise and sunset times can be obtained from newspapers, almanacs and various web sites including http://aa.usno.navy.mil/AA/data/ where you can get sunrise/sunset (among many other things) for any location. You can find the sunrise and sunset times for Princeton at http://mach.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/aa_rstablew.pl. Such data can provide good graphing activities such as tracking sunrise, sunset and day length for one day each week.    But wait a minute! I told you that there are 12 hours of daylight all the time at the equator and at all locations on the equinoxes, but if you look up sunrise and sunset times you will find a dew minutes more than 12 hours difference between sunrise and sunset at the equinoxes. Sunrise and sunset are expressed as the times when the sun is first and last seen at the horizon. There would be 12 hours between the time that the center of sun's disk crossed the horizon before the middle at sunrise and after the middle at sunset there is a bit more time than 12 hours between sunrise and sunset. What is more, twilight before sunrise and after sunset due to the scattering of light by the atmosphere extend apparent daylight somewhat. So when I was talking about daylight and darkness above I was really referring to the time differences between the center of the sun passing the horizon.    The important point is here that the changes of the length of time that a location is exposed to the sun contributes to the seasons. Longer exposure leads to greater warming.    Conclusion    Seasons exist on earth because the earth is nearly a sphere and the tilt of the earth's axis results in longer periods of daylight and a higher angle of the sun in the summer hemisphere and shorter periods of daylight and lower sun angles in the winter hemisphere. Longer daylight and higher sun angle result in greater heating. The fact that the earth's orbit is not perfectly circular has a much smaller effect than the factors listed above and does not produce the seasons, though it is important on the long time scale of ice ages (100,000 year time periods).</TEXT></DOC><DOC>??? can't source<TEXT>Energy is defined as the ability or capacity to do work on an objectWork is expressed mathematically as a force times distance. In the example discussed in class, in the process of pushing a boulder up a hill, you do work on the boulder. At the top of the hill, a boulder at rest has no motion, and thus no kinetic energy, but it has potential energy due to the presence of gravity. Give the boulder a nudge, and it rolls back down the hill. At the bottom of the hill, all of the boulder's potential energy has been converted to kinetic energy (neglecting friction).Energy is conserved; it cannot be destroyed. But it can be transferred from one form to another. Work is done when energy is trasnferred from one form to another. Some different forms of energy are:    * Kinetic energy (i.e. energy associated with an object's motion)    * Potential energy (associated with an object's position; requires gravity)    * Chemical energy (consumed or released when chemical bonds between molecules are formed or broken)    * Heat energy (associated with the random motion of molecules in a substance; think back to the definition of temperature as a measure of the average speed of molecules in a substance) A common measure of energy in atmospheric science is the calorie . It is defined as the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water one degree Celsius.The amount of energy falling on a horizontal surface at the average earth/sun distance is called the solar constant, and it is equal to 1.96 calories per square cm per minute.Power is a measure of energy per time, and it is commonly expressed in watts. The solar constant can be expressed equivalently as 1367 Watts per square meter.Insolation is defined as incoming solar radiation striking a horizontal surface. Imagine this surface is parallel to the earth's surface at lies at the top of the atmosphere. The solar constant (1.96 cal per square cm. per minute) is the average amount of energy passing through this surface.The amount of insolation received by the earth varies according to:    * your location on the earth's surface (measured as latitude)    * the time of year (i.e. the seasons) The latitude effect arises from the fact that at low latitudes, the sun's angle in the sky is very high (see Figure 3.4 in Danielson). As you move towards the poles (that is , as you move to higher latitudes), the sun's angle in the sky will get smaller and smaller. This "dilutes" the amount of insolation you receive - at higher latitudes the same amount of insolation is distributed over a larger area, due to the curvature of the earth.The seasonal effect is due to the fact that the earth is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees. As the earth orbits around the sun, the Northern Hemisphere will be tilted towards the sun for part of the time (summer) and away from the sun for part of the time (winter). Figure 3.5 shows the locations in the earth's orbit corresponding to the solstices and equinoxes.The distance between the earth and the sun changes over the course of the year (see Figure 3.5). Note that the earth is actually closest to the sun in January. This should tell you that the eath/sun distance does not determine the seasons.Be sure to carefully examine Figure 3.7. This illustrates the sun's path across the sky at different latitudes and for different times of the year. Note that the sun's angle is highest at low latitudes. Also note how the position of the sun changes throughout the year (e.g., the sun rises/sets due east/west on the equinoxes. Where does it rise/set on the solstices?).The image here depicts conditions on the summer solstice (Junew 21), when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. The orientation between the earth and the sun's rays (coming in on the right hand side of the figure) is such that the sunlight falls directly on the latitude of 23.5 degrees north (the Tropic of Cancer). For an observer at that location on the earth's surface, the sun would appear directly overhead at noon on this date.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milutin_Milankovitch<TEXT>Milutin Milankovitch attended the Technische Hochschule in Vienna (today Vienna University of Technology) where he graduated in Civil Engineering in 1902 and earned a doctorate in technical sciences in 1904. Later he worked in the then-famous firm of Adolf Baron Pittel Betonbau-Unternehmung in Vienna. He built dams, bridges, viaducts, aquaducts and other structures in reinforced concrete throughout the Austria-Hungary of the time. Milankovi? continued to practice civil engineering in Vienna until the autumn of 1909, when he was offered the chair of applied mathematics (rational mechanics, celestial mechanics, theoretical physics) in Belgrade. The year 1909 marked a turning-point in his life. Although he continued to pursue his investigations of various problems pertaining to the applications of reinforced concrete, he decided to concentrate on fundamental research.Turbulent events took place as soon as he had settled down in Belgrade, when the Balkan Wars were followed by World War I. When the war broke out in 1914 (he was just-married), he was interned by the Austro-Hungarian army in Neusiedl am See and later in Budapest, where he was allowed to work in the library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. As early as 1912, his interests turned to solar climates and temperatures prevailing on the planets. Throughout his internment in Budapest he devoted his time to this field and, by the end of the war, he had finished a monograph which was published in 1920, in the publications of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, by Gauthiers-Villards in Paris, under the title Th�orie math�matique des ph�nom?nes thermiques produits par la radiation solaire (Mathematical theory of thermal phenomena caused by solar radiation).The results set forth in this work won him a considerable reputation in the scientific world, notably for his "curve of insolation at the Earth's surface". This solar curve was not really accepted until 1924, when the great meteorologist and climatologist Wladimir K�ppen with his son-in-law Alfred Wegener, introduced the curve in their work, entitled Climates of the geological past. After these first tributes, Milankovitch? was invited, in 1927, to co-operate in two important publications: the first was a handbook on climatology (Handbuch der Klimatologie) and the second a handbook on geophysics (Gutenberg's Handbuch der Geophysik). The former, for which he wrote the introduction Mathematische Klimalehre und astronomische Theorie der Klimaschwankungen (Mathematical science of climate and astronomical theory of the variations of the climate), was published in 1930 in German, and in 1939 was translated into Russian. In it the theory of planetary climate is further developed with special reference to the Earth.He created the leap year rule of the Revised Julian calendar, in use by many orthodox churches, which is more accurate than the original Julian calendar, but less accurate than the Gregorian calendar on which it is based.For the second textbook, Milankovitch? wrote four sections developing and formulating his theory of the secular motion of the Earth's poles, and his theory of glacial periods (Milankovitch cycles), which was built on earlier work by James Croll. Milankovitch? was able to improve upon Croll's work partly by the use of improved calculations of the earth's orbit then recently published by Ludwig Pilgrim in 1904. Fully aware that his theory of solar radiation had been successfully completed, and that the papers dealing with this theory were dispersed in separate publications, he decided to collect and publish them under a single cover. Thus, in 1941, on the eve of war in his country, the printing of his great work Kanon der Erdbestrahlung und seine Anwendung auf das Eiszeitenproblem (Canon of Insolation of the Earth and Its Application to the Problem of the Ice Ages) was completed, 626 pages in quarto, in German, issued in the publications of the Royal Serbian Academy. This work was translated into English under the title Canon of Insolation of the Ice-Age Problem, in 1969 by the Israel Program for Scientific Translations, published by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Science Foundation, Washington, D.C..Objections were raised in the 1950s against the Milankovitch? theory of ice ages; these objections came mainly from meteorologists who claimed that the insolation changes due to the changes in the Earth's orbital elements were too small to significantly perturb the climate system. However, in the late 1960s and 1970s, investigation of the deep-sea sediments brought widespread acceptance of Milankovic's view, since the periodicity discovered (100,000 years) matched so closely with the longest orbital period ? see Ice age for more discussion.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2000-10/973000477.Es.r.html <TEXT>Some people use the word 'seasons' to mean 'the weather is reallydifferent for a long while' - as when summer is really different fromwinter, and so on. In that case you can find places on Earth where thereare really just two types of weather - summer and winter. These placestend to be near the Equator where it is either hot and rainy or hot anddry.        When you go nearer the North or South poles you start noticing fourdifferent types of weather through the year. The winter, with snow onthe ground and frost, the spring when the warmth is increasing andplantsstart to grow, the summer when it is warmest, and the fall when thewarmth isdecreasing and the plants stop growing.        However, other people define 'seasons' by the calendar only and inthat case there are only four seasons any place you go - summer, fall,winter and spring. The winter season is usually taken as December,January and February, with spring being the months of March, April andMay.Summer is June, July and August, and fall or autumn is September,October andNovember.        The main reason there are only these 4 seasons is that we are on aplanet that orbits a single star - the Sun - and that our planet tiltsits axis so that half the year it is pointing away from the Sun at theNorthpole and half the year it is pointing towards the Sun. If we were on aplanet that circled a binary - two stars - then we might se two Suns inthe sky and depending on the orbit around these two stars we might haveverymany seasons indeed, depending on how the orbit gave us more and lessstarshine through the year. It could be that conditions for life on aplanet circling a binary star would be so variable that life neverevolved on that planet and then there would be noone on it to makecalendars andrake leaves and plant bulbs and worry about seasons.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://au.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_781536380/Season.html <TEXT>Season, any of the four divisions of the year, defined by the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun. The four seasons, winter, spring, summer, and autumn, are characterized by differences in average temperature and in the length of daylight.The seasons occur because the axis of the Earth is tilted with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. Therefore, the North Pole and South Pole are each inclined towards the Sun for half the year. The hemisphere that is tilted towards the Sun has a longer day and receives more of the Sun's rays than the hemisphere tilted away from the Sun. Summer in the Northern hemisphere therefore corresponds to winter in the Southern hemisphere.II  Equinox and SolsticeOn about March 21 and September 23 the Sun is at one of the equinoxes, which are the two points in its yearly path where neither pole is inclined toward the Sun. At these times the Sun appears to be directly over the Earth's equator. The lengths of day and night are then equal over the whole Earth. (However, at the North and South Poles the Earth's atmosphere bends the Sun's rays sufficiently to make the Sun visible even during the 12 hours in which it is below the horizon. See Refraction.) The word equinox is also applied to the corresponding positions of the Earth in its orbit, and to the times when the Earth reaches these points. The equinoxes mark the beginning of the spring in one hemisphere and of autumn in the other.On about June 21 and December 22 the Sun arrives at one of the two solstices, the points in its path when the Sun is furthest from the celestial equator. (Solstice too can refer to the corresponding positions in the Earth's orbit or to the times when the Earth arrives there.) At the June solstice the Sun is at the northernmost point of its apparent path. The Northern hemisphere then has its longest day and the Southern hemisphere has its longest night. At the December solstice the situation is reversed: the Sun is at the southernmost point of its apparent path, and the Southern hemisphere has its longest day, while the Northern hemisphere has its longest night. The solstices mark the beginning of summer and winter.The seasons have an unequal number of days because the Sun is not at the centre of the Earth's elliptical orbit. The Earth is relatively close to the Sun at the December solstice, and its orbital speed is greater than usual. The two seasons adjoining the December solstice (autumn and winter in the Northern hemisphere, spring and summer in the Southern) are short.III  Temperature and Length of DayAt the solstices the Sun appears to be directly above the parallels of latitude called the tropic of Cancer and the tropic of Capricorn. At the time they were named, the Sun appeared in the constellation Cancer on June 21 and in the constellation Capricorn on December 22. The parallels of latitude at 66 33' north and 66 33' south are called, respectively, the Arctic and Antarctic circles. These circles mark the farthest points from the poles at which there can be 24 hours of daylight or 24 hours of night.The changes in temperature and in the length of daylight that accompany changes in season are markedly different at different latitudes. At the poles, summer is one long day and winter is one long night. Near the equator, on the other hand, days and nights each remain about 12 hours long throughout the year.Midway between the poles and the equator, the length of daylight varies from about 8 hours in winter to about 16 hours in summer. However, the days when the Sun is near the summer solstice are not the hottest days of the year, even though that hemisphere then receives the greatest amount of solar radiation. Temperature depends not only on the amount of heat received but also on the amount stored in the oceans, atmosphere, and ground. As a result, the average temperature continues to increase for some time after the summer solstice. In the Northern hemisphere the temperature peaks about August 1. Similarly, the coldest days in the Northern hemisphere usually occur about February 1. One of the effects of global warming has been the progressively earlier arrival of warmer temperatures each spring and the later arrival of cooler temperatures each autumn. The results of botanical studies conducted across Europe in carefully controlled conditions were published in 1999 and showed that over the previous 30 years the growing season for plants in the northern hemisphere had increased by more than ten days, with spring "arriving" some six days earlier than at the start of the test period, and autumn temperatures beginning more than four days later. </TEXT></DOC><DOC>??? http://www.indopedia.org/Season.html<TEXT>A season is one of the major divisions of the year, generally based on broad climatic patterns. Typically, the year is divided into four seasons: spring, summer, autumn (fall), and winter.Some cultures may have a different number of seasons; for instance, some indigenous peoples in Australia's Northern Territory use six seasons. In tropical and even subtropical regions it is more common to speak of the rainy (or wet, or monsoon) season versus the dry season, as the amount of precipitation may vary more dramatically than the average temperature.Causes and climatic effectsThe primary cause of the seasons is the fact that the Earth's axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane; it deviates by an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees of arc. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the Sun (see Fig. 1). This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons Seasonal weather fluctuations also depend on factors such as proximity to oceans or other large bodies of water, currents in those oceans, El Nino/ENSO and other oceanic cycles, and prevailing winds.In the temperate and polar regions, seasons are marked by changes in the amount of sunlight, which in turn often cause cycles of dormancy in plants and hibernation in animals. These effects vary with latitude, and with proximity to bodies of water. For example, the South Pole is in the middle of the continent of Antarctica, and therefore a considerable distance from the moderating influence of the southern oceans. The North Pole is in the Arctic Ocean, and thus its temperature extremes are buffered by the presence of all that water. The result is that the South Pole is consistently colder during the southern winter than the North Pole during the northern winter.The cycle of seasons in the polar and temperate zones of one hemisphere is opposite to that in the other. When it is summer in the Northern hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern hemisphere, and vice versa, and when it is spring in the Northern hemisphere it is autumn in the Southern hemisphere, and vice versa.In the tropics, there is no noticeable change in the amount of sunlight. However, many regions (famously the northern Indian Ocean) are subject to monsoons rain and wind cycles.Curiously, a study of temperature records over the past 300 years (David Thompson, SCIENCE, April 1995) shows that the climatic seasons, and thus the seasonal year, are governed by the anomalistic year rather than the tropical year.Polar day and nightA common misconception is that, within the Arctic and Antarctic Circles, the sun rises once in the spring and sets once in the fall; thus, the day and night are erroneously thought to last uninterrupted for 183 calendar days each. This actually is true only in the immediate region of the poles themselves.What does happen is that any point north of the Arctic (or south of the Antarctic) Circle will have one period in the summer when the sun does not set, and one period in the winter when the sun does not rise. At progressively higher latitudes, the periods of "midnight sun" (or "midday dark" for the other side of the globe) are progressively longer. For example, at the military and weather station called Alert on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island, Canada (about 450 nautical miles or 830 km from the North Pole), the sun begins to peek above the horizon in mid-April and each day it climbs a bit higher, and stays up a bit longer. However, mid-April is not first light. The sky (as seen from Alert) has been showing twilight, or at least a pre-dawn glow on the horizon, for increasing hours each day, for more than a month before that first sliver of sun appears.In the weeks surrounding June 21, the sun is at its highest, and it appears to circle the sky without ever going below the horizon. Eventually, it does go below the horizon, for progressively longer and longer periods each day until, around the middle of October, it disappears for the last time. For a few more weeks, "day" is marked by decreasing periods of twilight. Eventually, for the weeks surrounding December 21, nothing breaks the darkness. In later winter, the first faint wash of light briefly touches the horizon (for just minutes per day), and then increases in duration and pre-dawn brightness each day until sunrise in April.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.solarviews.com/eng/earth.htm <TEXT>From the perspective we get on Earth, our planet appears to be big and sturdy with an endless ocean of air. From space, astronauts often get the impression that the Earth is small with a thin, fragile layer of atmosphere. For a space traveler, the distinguishing Earth features are the blue waters, brown and green land masses and white clouds set against a black background.Many dream of traveling in space and viewing the wonders of the universe. In reality all of us are space travelers. Our spaceship is the planet Earth, traveling at the speed of 108,000 kilometers (67,000 miles) an hour.Earth is the 3rd planet from the Sun at a distance of about 150 million kilometers (93.2 million miles). It takes 365.256 days for the Earth to travel around the Sun and 23.9345 hours for the Earth rotate a complete revolution. It has a diameter of 12,756 kilometers (7,973 miles), only a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus. Our atmosphere is composed of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other constituents.Earth is the only planet in the solar system known to harbor life. Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the atmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun and other stars. Earth's atmosphere protects us from meteors, most of which burn up before they can strike the surface.From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our home planet. The first American satellite, Explorer 1, discovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen radiation belts. This layer is formed from rapidly moving charged particles that are trapped by the Earth's magnetic field in a doughnut-shaped region surrounding the equator. Other findings from satellites show that our planet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by the solar wind. We also now know that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and uneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and contracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.Earth South AmericaThis color image of the Earth was obtained by Galileo at about 6:10 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on Dec. 11, 1990, when the spacecraft was about 1.3 million miles from the planet.

The blackness of space contrasts sharply with the whiteness of clouds, ice, and snow. The only true color is the blue of the Atlantic Ocean and the Labrador Sea. Cloud-free conditions existing along the southern coastal area emphasize the deeply indented fjords along the coast. A close look at the white areas reveals three different features-snow and ice on the land; cloud formations over the central region and the eastern and western sides of the island; and wispy-looking ice floes off the southeast and the southwest tip of the fjord-lined coast, which are moved by the East Greenland Current to the south-southwest, and larger ice packs developing north along the east coast. Greenland has the only surviving continental glacier in the Northern Hemisphere. This ice sheet covers seven-eighths of Greenland's surface and contains an estimated 11 percent of the world's fresh water.

This is the first picture of the whole Antarctic continent taken nearly at once from space. Galileo was about 200,000 kilometers (125,000 miles) from Earth when the pictures were taken.The icy continent is surrounded by the dark blue of three oceans: the Pacific to the left, the Indian to the bottom, and a piece of the Atlantic to the upper right. Nearly the entire continent was sunlit at this time of year, just two weeks before southern summer solstice. The arc of dark spots extending from near the South Pole (close to the center) toward the lower left is the Transantarctic Mountain Range.

The images were acquired between May 24, 1984 and May 14, 1986.On false-color infrared mosaics, vegetation appears in various tones of red instead of green. The "redness" indicates vegetation density, type and whether growing on dry land or in a swamp (a mixture of reddish vegetation and dark blue surface water produces dark tones). Grasslands appear light red, deciduous trees and croplands appear red, and coniferous forests appear dark red or maroon. Desert areas appear white and urban areas (pavement and buildings) appear bluish green. Lakes, rivers and oceans appear in various shades of blue, dark blue for deep water and light blue for shallow or turbid water. Exposed bedrock generally appears as a dark bluish-green or other dark tone.

It is the second smallest planet in the Solar system after Pluto, and is about a third of the size of Earth.The length of days and years on Mercury are vastly different to those on Earth. Mercury rotates on its axis once every 58.9 Earth days. It circles the Sun once every 87.9 Earth days. In other words, if you were to stay up from sunrise to sunset on Mercury, you would need to be awake for two Mercury years, or 176 Earth days!Being the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury experiences the hottest surface temperatures out of all the planets in the solar system, but it also sees a broader range of temperatures too. The lack of any substantial atmosphere contributes to this range in temperatures. The atmosphere is very thin and is made up of helium and sodium.The side of the planet nearest to the sun has temperatures reaching up to 427C. In comparison, the side in night time experiences temperatures which fall as low as -183C.Evidence of ice on Mercury? Although closest to the Sun, Mercury's slow orbit means it also experiences extreme coldness. Radar imagery which is used to study Mercury from Earth, shows reflectivity near the north and south poles. It is suggested this could be an indication that ice has formed there. If the areas are shadowed, possibly by a crater, it is thought this could be the case. There are two suggestions about where the ice has come from; one is from meteorite bombardment, the other is planetary outgassing. Meteorites were thought to carry vast quantities of water in the past.As Mercury is so far away, very little exploration has been carried out. The only spacecraft to travel there was in 1974, by the Mariner 10. Over three trips it imaged around half of the planet. To date the other half is still untouched, so a true picture of the planet, or its weather, is not known.Mercury does not have a moon and its gravity is about a third of that of the Earth.

He named it J002E3.Automated asteroid surveys scan the skies every few weeks, yet there was no sign of Yeung's object earlier this year. "It must have entered Earth orbit recently," says Paul Chodas of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program at JPL. "But it doesn't match any recently-launched spacecraft."In other words, it's a mystery.Above: Andrea Aletti of the Schiaparelli Astronomical Observatory captured this 10-minute exposure of J002E3 gliding among the stars of the constellation Taurus on Sept. 17th. J002E3 rotates or tumbles every minute or so, which causes the brightness variations shown in the picture. [more]Could it be an alien spaceship? "If it is," says Chodas, "the aliens aren't good pilots. J002E3 is in a chaotic orbit. It loops around Earth once every 48 days or so, coming as close to our planet as the Moon and ranging as far away as two lunar distances." There's no evidence that the speck is moving under its own power. The orbit is constantly changing because of gravitational perturbations by the Sun and Moon.At first Yeung and others thought J002E3 might be a small asteroid--a reasonable guess. The object is as bright as a 30m-wide space rock and it's moving about as fast as an asteroid should move. Mars and Jupiter have captured asteroid moons before; perhaps Earth had done the same.It was a good idea, except for the paint.That's what University of Arizona astronomers found on Sept. 12th when they measured the spectrum of sunlight reflected from J002E3. "The colors were consistent with ... white titanium dioxide paint--the type of paint NASA used on Apollo moon rockets 30 years ago," says Carl Hergenrother, who conducted the study with colleague Robert Whiteley.So, J002E3 might be a spacecraft after all--an old one from Earth. Where has it been all these years?"Orbiting the Sun," answers Chodas. "I've traced the motion of J002E3 backwards in time to find out where it's been," he explains. Apparently, J002E3 left Earth in 1971, went around the Sun 30 or so times, and came back again. Chodas, a expert in planetary motion who has seen plenty of complicated orbits, says "I've never seen anything like this."At first glance, J002E3 would seem to be from Apollo 14. That mission began in January of 1971, and according to Chodas' calculations J002E3 broke out of Earth orbit in March of the same year. There's a problem, though: NASA has accounted for all the big pieces of the Apollo 14 spacecraft. None are missing.Chodas inventories the mission: On Jan. 31, 1971, a Saturn V rocket blasted off from Florida with Al Shepard, Ed Mitchell and Stuart Roosa inside. Two stages of the rocket fell back to Earth when they exhausted their fuel. A third stage, the S-IVB fuel tank and rocket engine, which propelled the crew from Earth-orbit toward the Moon, was likewise discarded. The S-IVB, however, did not fall back to Earth; it hit the Moon. Ground controllers guided it there on purpose to provide an impact for lunar seismic monitoring stations. The lunar module Antares was also deliberately crashed--more data for the seismic network. The command module Kitty Hawk returned the crew to Earth.J002E3 couldn't be any of those things. "There is an outside chance that it might be one of the Spacecraft-Lunar Module Adapter (SLA) panels," adds Chodas, "although J002E3 appears to be too bright for one of those."Another possibility is that J002E3 is an S-IVB from Apollo 12. Unlike Apollo 14, Apollo 12's S-IVB did not crash into the Moon. The crew jettisoned it on Nov. 15, 1969, when it was nearly out of fuel. Once the astronauts were safely away, ground controllers ignited the S-IVB's engine. They meant to send the 60-ft-long tank into a Sun-centered orbit, but something went wrong; the burn lasted too long. Instead of circling the Sun, the S-IVB entered a barely-stable orbit around the Earth and Moon "much like the current orbit of J002E3," notes Chodas.Eventually, the Apollo 12 S-IVB vanished--no one knows when. Perhaps gravitational tugs from the Sun and Moon accumulated until they nudged the engine away from Earth in 1971. In this scenario, it would have circled the Sun for 31 years until it was re-captured by Earth's gravity in 2002."It's plausible," says Chodas, "but still speculative."Whatever J002E3 is, it's taking a fantastic journey through the solar system--and it's not done yet. Chodas' calculations indicate that J002E3 will leave Earth again in June 2003 to resume its orbit around the Sun. "Thirty years from now," he notes, "it might come back again."If it does, perhaps it will be greeted by human explorers on regular "milk runs" between the Earth and Moon. They might detour briefly and discover, once and for all, what J002E3 really is: a historical attraction, maybe, or something wholly unexpected....For now the best we can do is watch J002E3 from afar--an unresolved speck of light easily detected by 8" to 10" telescopes with CCD cameras. This week J002E3 is gliding through the constellation Taurus. Where will it go next? Find out by visiting JPL's Near-Earth Object Program web site, which offers a helpful ephemeris for observers. J002E3 won't be here long, so catch it while you can!Editor's note #2: Could the Hubble Space Telescope take a picture of J002E3 and see what it is? No. With its 2.4 meter diameter mirror, the smallest object that the Hubble can resolve at the Moon's distance is about 80 meters across. J002E3 is no larger than about 30 meters if it is an asteroid or 20 meters if it is an S-IVB--too small for Hubble.Editor's note #1: Earlier this week, Chodas noted that J002E3 might hit the Moon in 2003. The odds he estimated were 20%--a figure which was widely reported. The odds have since declined. His latest calculations indicate that J002E3 has less than a 1% chance of hitting the Moon before June 2003, and no chance of hitting Earth. Even if J002E3 did hit Earth, notes Chodas, it wouldn't reach our planet's surface. "The object would completely disintegrate in the atmosphere as a beautiful fireball." Regarding the possibility of a lunar impact, University of Arizona professor Jay Melosh explains that J002E3 is not traveling fast enough to create a bright fireball if it hits the lunar surface. "More likely," he says, "the impact would produce a glowing infra-red cloud like the one astronomers observed when the Japanese Hiten spacecraft hit the Moon in 1993."</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://physics.ucsd.edu/students/courses/winter2002/physics6/notes1.pdf<TEXT>Features of the solar system:      - all the planets orbit the sun (their orbits are nearly circular)      - the orbits of the planets lie in nearly the same plane (that is, the solar system is disk-shaped)      - all the planets orbit in the same direction (counterclockwise if viewed from above)      - most planets spin in this same directionThese features suggest the following scenario for the evolution of the solar system. The solar system likely began as a rotating interstellar cloud of gas and dust. Something then happened to initiate the collapse of the cloud. The central part of the cloud (which would eventually be the sun) continued to collapse as a result of its own gravitational attraction; as it collapsed, it heated up until the temperature and pressure inside were high enough for nuclear reactions to occur. This is the energy source that still fuels the sun today.While this process was occurring, gravitation forced the outer part of the cloud into the shape of a disk. The result was an early sun surrounded by a flat, rotating disk of gas and dust. Eventually, solid particles in the rotating disk began to condense out of the gas. These particles coalesced into larger objects, called "planetesimals", which themselves collided and coalesced further, eventually forming planets and moons. These early stages of solar system evolution are indicated in the sketches below:There were still lots of smaller planetesimals around after the planets formed. They continued to collide with the planets and moons, causing the extensive cratering that occurred early in the history of the solar system, and is still evident on many objects today.[As an aside, there's no reason to believe the formation of our solar system was unusual. There are lots of large interstellar clouds in our galaxy--many of which have been identified as sites of star formation. Our sun is an average star, so it's reasonable to assume that planets might form around other stars. But other stars (even close ones) are so far away, that it is extremely difficult to detect planets around them. Astronomers are only just at the point that they are beginning to detect a few planets around nearby stars.]The above scenario successfully accounts for the major characteristics of our solar system. The following diagrams show two views of the solar system. The first shows the orbits of the furthest planets, roughly to scale. The orbits of the inner planets cannot be made out on this scale.The next 2 diagrams are side views -- the first shows the orbits of the first four planets; the second shows (on a different scale) the orbits of the outer five. All but Pluto lie in nearly the same plane.The following is a brief description of the sun and each of the nine known planets.The Sun.The sun is a middle-age star, of average (for a star) size, mass and temperature. It is basically a ball of hot hydrogen and helium gas (about 70% hydrogen and 27% helium) . Though it is an average-sized star, it is by far the largest and most massive object in the solar system -- its mass, for example, is about 300,000 times that of Earth.The sun is held together by gravity, and kept from collapsing further by the pressure of its hot gas. The temperature near the center of the sun reaches ~ 10 million degrees (Centigrade). At the temperatures and pressures in the sun's core, nuclear reactions (nuclear fusion) can occur. These nuclear reactions (in which hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, and energy is released) are the source of the sun's energy.The sun, of course, is the primary source of light and heat in the solar system. This distinguishes stars from planets. Stars "burn" atomic "fuel" in nuclear reactions that produce energy; planets do not. We see the planets at night because they are reflecting light produced by the sun - not because they are generating that light themselves.The Planets.The nine known planets fall naturally into categories. The first four planets are called the "terrestrial" planets. They are relatively small, solid bodies, with similar compositions and densities:      Mercury      Venus      Earth      MarsThe next four planets are significantly different. They are much larger, composed primarily of light elements, and not very dense:      Jupiter      Saturn      Uranus      NeptunePluto, the ninth planet, is small and icy, and does not fall into either of these categories.The nine planets are shown to scale in the composite. The sun is not to scale; it half the size it should be.The Terrestrial Planets.Mercury is the smallest of the planets, and also the closest to the sun. It is only slightly larger than the Earth's moon, and is a generally inhospitable place. It has no atmosphere, and its temperature reaches a high of about 400 oC and drops as low as minus 160 oC. Like Earth, it has a dense core. But its surface is covered with impact craters - the result of billions of years of bombardment.Venus has often been called Earth's sister planet. It is very nearly the same size and density as Earth, and is our nearest planetary neighbor. Several U.S. spacecraft have orbited Venus (Magellan is in Venus orbit right now); Soviet spacecraft have actually landed on its surface. As a result, scientists have recently learned a lot about this planet.Though Venus is similar to Earth in some ways, it is very different in others. It has an extremely dense atmosphere, composed primarily of carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the surface is enormous: 90 times that at the surface of the Earth. [This is equivalent to the pressure 3000' below the ocean's surface]. Dense layers of clouds, made mostly of concentrated sulfuric acid, cover the entire planet. The sulfur probably enters the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions.Venus' surface temperature is much higher than Earth's, approximately 450oC. This is not because of its proximity to the sun, but because of the "greenhouse effect" produced by the enormous amount of CO2 in its atmosphere. The surface terrain consists of rolling plains with large volcanic craters, high mountains and long, deep trenches. Little erosion has taken place because there is no liquid flowing on the surface, and almost no wind on Venus.Earth is the third planet from the sun. It has a dense, molten core and a solid surface, much of which is covered by water. Earth has an atmosphere which is composed primarily of nitrogen (~80%) and oxygen (~ 20%). [Interestingly, the total amount of CO2 on Earth is about the same as on Venus, but it's held in carbonate rocks or dissolved in the oceans.] The two features which distinguish Earth from the other planets are 1) the existence of liquid water 2) the existence of life. Both have modified the atmosphere during the life of the planet.      Our Moon orbits the Earth at a distance of ~ 1/4 million miles. It is the only body in the solar system which has been visited by humans. It is considerably smaller than Earth: its radius is about 1/4 that of Earth (and therefore its volume is only 1/64 that of Earth) and its mass is about 1% that of Earth. The Moon has no atmosphere (its gravity is not strong enough to hold one), and its rugged terrain is covered with craters caused by impacts with meteorites.Mars, the 4th planet from the sun, is slightly smaller and lighter than Earth. Several U.S. and Soviet spacecraft have visited Mars, including the two Viking spacecraft which landed on its surface in 1976, and Pathfinder, which landed in 1997.Mars has a thin atmosphere (much thinner than Earth's) composed mostly of carbon dioxide. Its surface is covered with dust and frost. Iron in the soil gives the "Red Planet" its color. Mars is not flat and featureless. There are huge volcanoes -- one 90,000 feet high (3 times the height of Mt. Everest), volcanic craters, channels that appear to have been caused by flowing liquid (possibly water) sometime in the past, and deep canyons -- one of which dwarfs the Grand Canyon on Earth (7 km deep, 700 km across, and 4500 km long--the length of the United States).During the past century, scientists and science fiction writers alike have speculated about the existence of life on Mars. The Viking landers carried experiments designed to scoop up soil samples and analyze them for signs of metabolic activity and/or the presence of organic molecules. These experiments did not find evidence of life, but it is still possible that life exists elsewhere on Mars, or that life existed long ago (when, perhaps, there was liquid water on the planet).Mars has two very small moons (each would fit within the city limits of San Diego). They are both elongated pieces of rock, similar to asteroids (and may, in fact, be captured asteroids).The Outer Planets.Our knowledge and understanding of the next four "giant" planets have been greatly enhanced by the data and pictures sent back by the two Voyager spacecraft. These spacecraft took advantage of a rare planetary alignment, and were able to travel from one giant planet to the next between 1977 and 1989. When Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are lined-up correctly in their orbits, each planet's gravity can be used--like a slingshot--to speed-up the spacecraft and bend its path toward the next planet. This planetary alignment occurs only once every 176 years.Jupiter is the biggest planet in the solar system--more than one thousand Earths would fit inside it. It is made mostly of hydrogen and helium gas, which gets thicker and thicker toward the center of the planet, eventually becoming liquid.The planet's thick atmosphere contains wide bands of yellow, orange, red and white clouds, with large, violent storms moving through them. The most impressive of these is the Great Red Spot, a huge swirling storm that has been visible in Jupiter's atmosphere for hundreds of years.Jupiter has 16 moons that circle around it like a miniature solar system. Three of these moons were discovered by Voyager. One of the major surprises of Voyager's encounter with Jupiter was the 1979 discovery that Io, one of Jupiter's moons, has active volcanoes on its surface. These were the first active volcanoes detected anywhere else in the solar system.For hundreds of years, Saturn had been known as the planet with rings. The Voyager mission discovered that Jupiter has a single thin ring made of small dust particles in orbit around the planet.Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar system--only Jupiter is bigger. It is also made mostly of hydrogen and helium gas, and is the only planet with a density less than that of water--if you could find a bucket of water big enough, Saturn would float in it. Saturn is a hazy yellow planet with broad belts of brown, yellow and orange clouds, and swirling storms like those at Jupiter. High winds howl through its atmosphere, and reach 1000 miles per hour near the equator.Saturn's famous rings are made of countless pieces of rock and ice in orbit around the planet. The particles range in size from small grains to big rocks the size of trucks. There is enough rock and ice in the rings to make a medium-sized moon--in fact, the rings may be what's left of a moon that was long ago shattered by collisions.Like Jupiter, Saturn has several moons in orbit around it. Voyager discovered four, bringing the number of known Saturnian moons to 18.Uranus is about 2.9 billion kilometers from the sun. It took Voyager 2 more than four years to travel there from Saturn. At this distance from the sun, Uranus gets very little heat and light. Its atmosphere does not have streaming bands, or swirling storms like Jupiter and Saturn. Its pale blue, featureless atmosphere is made mostly of hydrogen and helium gas. It also contains small amounts of methane, which is what gives Uranus its blue color.Uranus is unusual in that it lies "on its side" as it orbits the sun--its axis of rotation lies in the plane of its orbit. This is probably the result of a major collision-- with an object about the size of Earth.A system of nine thin rings was discovered around Uranus in 1977. Voyager discovered two more when it went past in 1986. Voyager also discovered ten new moons around Uranus, bringing the known number for this planet up to 15.Uranus was the first planet to be discovered by telescopic observations instead of the human eye.Neptune was not discovered with a telescope, but with pencil and paper. Its existence and location were deduced because of the small perturbations it causes in Uranus' orbit. Neptune is similar to Uranus in size and composition. It is a cold, blue planet with violent weather. Its atmosphere has wild storms, like those on Jupiter and Saturn, including one huge storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Winds near the edges of this storm are over 1400 miles per hour--the strongest winds measured on any planet.The Voyager 2 spacecraft discovered rings around Neptune. This means that all four giant planets have ring systems. Neptune has two narrow rings and two broad rings, made of small, black particles. Telescopic observations from Earth had found two moons around Neptune; Voyager discovered six more.Voyager's trajectory could not be diverted sufficiently at Neptune to send it on to intercept Pluto. After its Neptune encounter, it headed downward and out of the main plane of the solar system.Pluto was discovered from telescopic observations in 1930. It does not follow the pattern of other planets in the solar system. Its orbit is highly elliptical, and it is tilted out of the plane of the solar system. Pluto is not a giant planet with a thick atmosphere like the other outer planets. Instead, it is a small, solid, icy body with low mass (less than one percent that of Earth). It also appears to have a thin atmosphere. Pluto has one known moon, Charon, which is very close to the planet (20 times closer than our moon is to us), and quite large for such a small planet. Pluto and Charon remain a mystery. No spacecraft has been near this planet, and none is currently headed in that direction.The "edge of the solar system"--that is, the place where the sun's influence ends-- has not yet been found. Both Voyager spacecraft are still within the solar system-- even though they were launched over fourteen years ago, and are travelling more than 35,000 miles per hour. Both spacecraft have instruments which are still working and will send back data for tens of years. Scientists expect them to reach the "heliopuase", and finally leave our solar system, sometime around the year 2000.The table below shows data for the nine planets relative to Earth. For each planet the table gives its distance from the sun (relative to the Earth's distance), the time it takes to orbit the sun once (relative to the Earth's period of revolution--1 year), its diameter (relative to the Earth's diameter), and its mass (relative to the Earth's mass).The Earth is approximately 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) from the sun; it takes it one year to go around the sun; its diameter is 12,700 kilometers (8,000 miles). As an example of the relative sizes and distances, Jupiter is 5.2 times further from the sun than Earth is--that is, it is 780 million kilometers (480 million miles) from the sun; it takes it 11.9 years to orbit the sun once; and its diameter is 11 times that of Earth, or 143,000 kilometers (88,000 miles). </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.explorit.org/science/planets.html<TEXT>Our solar system consists of a star - the Sun - with nine planets under its gravitational influence. Each planet is spinning on its own axis as it orbits the Sun. The planets are different from each other and are in different orbits although they all move around the Sun in the same direction. The four inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) are known as terrestrial planets. Of the remaining five planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) that spin in wider orbits, further away from the Sun, four are known as gas giants because they are huge, dense balls of hydrogen and other gases. Pluto, the furthest away from the sun is tiny and cold and perhaps is not truly a planet.Here is some basic information about each one, including Earth.Mercury Is the planet closest to the Sun Completes an orbit of the Sun every 88 Earth days A waterless, airless world, heavily cratered. Virtually no atmosphere but some argon, helium and neon Mercury has a magnetic field and is so dense for its small size that scientists think that it is mostly iron. It is seen as either a "Morning Star" or an "Evening Star". Pluto is the only planet smaller than Mercury.Venus The second planet from the Sun Completes an orbit of the Sun every 224.7 Earth days The surface has mountains and plains Atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide but clouds contain sulphuric acid and water Venus is the planet that passes closest to Earth as they both orbit the Sun. The planet surface is shrouded by clouds which move around the planet very fast producing constant strong winds. Like Mercury, Venus is seen either as a "Morning Star" or an "Evening Star".Earth The third planet from the Sun Completes an orbit of the Sun every 365.26 Earth days A world of oceans and continents, with polar caps Atmosphere is nitrogen and oxygen with clouds of water vapor Earth is the only planet of our Sun known to have organic life. From space it appears as a bright blue and white sphere. It appears blue because 75 percent of its surface is water, and white because 50 percent of its surface is covered by clouds.Mars The fourth planet from the Sun Completes an orbit of the Sun every 687 Earth days (1.9 yrs) The surface is dry and cratered, has volcanoes and canyons Atmosphere is thin; mostly carbon dioxide with some nitrogen Mars is the outermost of the four terrestrial planest. It has a reddish color (and so is sometimes called the Red Planet) because of the iron oxide (rust) in its soil. Olympus Mons is an inactive volcano as tall as Mount Everest. There are huge canyons one of which is four times deeper that Earth's Grand Canyon. The planet is very cold and has dust storms whipped by hurricane force winds. Mars has two satellites, Deimos and Phobos.Jupiter The fifth planet from the Sun Completes an orbit of the Sun every 4,332.6 Earth days (11.86 yrs) Surface is ocean of liquid hydrogen Atmosphere is thick and is mostly hydrogen, with some helium and traces of methane, water and ammonia. Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system - it is 11 times bigger than Earth. As Jupiter spins its thick clouds tend to form bands and give the planet its red-brown-white banded appearance. Jupiter's Great Red Spot was first observed about 300 years ago and appears to be a permanent hurricane. This planet has 16 moons (satellites). The four largest were described by Galileo. Ganymede, the largest of these four, is the largest moon in our solar system, larger than the planets Pluto and Mercury.Saturn The sixth planet from the Sun Completes an orbit of the Sun every 10,759.2 Earth days (29.5 yrs) The surface is probably liquid and solid hydrogen Atmosphere is mostly hydrogen with some helium Saturn is the second largest planet after Jupiter. It has a pale yellow color, and very dramatic rings containing ice crystals rotate around the planet. Tremendously strong winds blow constantly at the equator. Saturn has at least 15 moons most of them small and composed of rock and ice. Titan, the largest appears to be the only moon in our solar system to have an atmosphere.Uranus The seventh planet from the Sun Completes an orbit of the Sun every 30,685.4 Earth days (84 yrs) The surface is probably a liquid or slushy hydrogen "crust" Atmosphere is hydrogen, helium and methane; very clear with no clouds. Uranus, barely visible in Earth's night sky, was not discovered until 1781. It has a faintly greenish color due perhaps to the methane in its atmosphere. It has faint rings and 5 moons.Neptune The eighth planet from the Sun Completes an orbit of the Sun every 60,189 Earth days (164.8 yrs) The surface is probably a slushy hydrogen "crust" Atmosphere is hydrogen and helium Neptune was discovered in 1846. It has as a pale bluish color from space and its atmosphere often looks hazy. The planet is very cold but probably has a hot core. It has at least eight moons. Two (Triton and Nereid) were first observed from Earth and six others were observed by Voyager 2.Pluto The ninth planet from the Sun Completes an orbit of the Sun every 90,465 Earth days (247.7 yrs) Is a ball of frozen gases Frozen methane has been detected Pluto was discovered in 1930 and is about half the size of Earth's moon. It has one known moon, Charon, which was discovered in 1978. Some scientists think that although we call Pluto a planet, it was perhaps once a moon of Neptune and was pulled out of its orbit by the pull from some other celestial body </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.harmsy.freeuk.com/earth.html<TEXT>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the first to have a moon, a common feature of all of the other planets beyond our orbit. The atmosphere reaches to about 80km above the surface, only about one-hundredth of the planet's radius, and so occupies a relatively thin band around the planet. The Earth is accompanied by one natural satellite; the Moon. Occasionally, they pass in front of the sun, casting a shadow onto each other. These are called eclipses.Air To BreatheThe atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with small traces of other gases. These proportions remain fairly constant up to around 80km, but the heavy gases become rare at greater heights and only hydrogen and helium are found in the outermost regions.The Earth's Thin Vale25km above the surface, a concentrated layer of ozone (O3) exists. This ozone layer is vital to life on the planet, as it stops nearly all of the Sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation from reaching the surface. Scientists believe that we have been damaging it, increasing the risk of skin cancer.The Earth's atmosphere contains a large amount of water vapour, although its concentration varies, and depends on the time of the year. Most is visible as clouds, extending no higher than 13km. It is in this region that the dominant weather systems are found. Above this lies a layer of warm air which holds cooler air below containing most of the water vapour, and the clouds that we see.Beauty in the SkiesRegions of the Earth towards the poles experience regular light shows in their night skies - the famous auroras caused by the sun.Longitude!The story of how humanity finally conquered the earth's oceans is brought to life by Dava Sobel in her best-selling book: Longitude. You can see John Harrison's solutions - clocks - at the Old Royal Greenwich Observatory in London.Cloudless Earth?The image shows the Earth's surface as it would look without clouds. It was made from mosaic of thousands of satellite images. The Pull of GravityUntil Newton, no-one had any real idea as to why we all walk around on the surface of the Earth, held in place by an invisible force. Newton showed that not only does it hold us in place, but it also holds the planets in orbit around the Sun.Active SurfaceThe surface of the planet has much geological activity, and is shaped by continental drifting (plate tectonics). This makes the surface relatively young. Combined with other factors, such as the atmosphere and weathering, it explains why few visible impact craters can be found. The heavily cratered surface of the moon gives a more accurate guide as to the quantity of collisions with debris making its way through the solar system. Here, surface features date back to the formation of the solar system, and have remained undisturbed due to the moon's geological inactivity.The structure of the planet itself is divided into three regions: the crust which extends for roughly 7km beneath the oceans and 40km beneath the continents; the mantle which is roughly 2870km thick; and the core which accounts for the remaining 3480km.The core is composed of two layers: the inner is solid; the outer flows. They are both composed mainly of iron, and it is convection in the molten outer layer that plays an important role in accounting for the planet's magnetic field. Interestingly, the magnetic field reverses every million years or so; north becoming south, and vice versa.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.science-projects.com/Astro/OrbitsAll.htm<TEXT>INTRODUCTION. This project is in many ways similar to that for determining the shape of the earth-moon-sun system. In fact, you should start out the very same way - finding the orientation of the earth's orbit around the sun. We shall be using the terrestrial orbital plane as our "reference plane," and making a valiant attempt to orient the planes of the other planets to this reference. In particular, we shall be interested in the orbits of Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.Because not all of these planets will be visible at one time, this project could be a long one - even as long as 9 months. But remember that the length of the project does not mean that it is very difficult to do. It is a "catch-as-catch-can" type of project. About the only trouble the extended time will impose on you is that you will have to re-establish your earth-orbit plane (i.e.: your stakes and cardboard) on the days immediately before you do your night-viewing of the planets. But, welcome to astronomy! You are asking: how do I know when to set up the cardboard BEFORE the night of viewing? This is not too difficult: if one night you see some planets, and the weather report is for fair weather for the next 36 hours, you know that you can set up your stakes and cardboard the next day, and do your viewing the next night. (If you are observant, you will notice that "your" selected planet has moved a little among the background of true stars between your two nights. Afterall, the word planet derives from "wanderer.")Placement of your cardboard plane for planetary observations is a bit more tricky than for watching the sun. Planets, such as Venus particularly, are often low to the horizon. Thus your set-up should have a fairly good view of the eastern and western horizons.Because you will want to know whether a given planet is on one side or the other of your earth orbital plane, you might want to make a slight modification of your stakes and cardboard. First, where the stakes go into the ground should be a foot or more apart. Second, you should put a small nail into each stake about a foot above the ground. Let these nails support the cardboard. Now you can place an old pillow on the ground between the stakes. Lie down and put your head on the pillow. Your eyes will be able to sight directly up one side and the other so that you can see exactly whether a planet is sighted on one side or the other. You might also want to keep a record in your diary of how far away from the plane the planet is. If you see, for example, that jupiter is on one side of the plane one month, and several months later it is on the other side, you will know that jupiter's orbital plane intersects with the earth's orbital plane. In other words, the two orbits are not exactly coplanar.If you are so lucky as to see a comet, which lasts for many nights before it "sets" as it approaches the sun, you might want to determine its orbital plane relative to that of the earth's plane. You know enough now to be able to figure out how to do that.How to find the planets in the first place. Probably by this time you have read that the solar system is rather "flat" - all the planets have orbits that a moderately close to being coplanar - except for Pluto, which is "way out there". But you cannot see Pluto anyway, so we will ignore it until you advance far enough to have access to a multimillion dollar telescope! Thus you can expect to find the planets somewhere close to the ecliptic. Happily, they are rather easy to find because they are usually among the brightest objects in the nighttime sky. (Of course, if you see something bright that you can see perceptibly moving across the sky, it might be a high flying airplane - OR an orbiting space lab that is still reflecting the sun's rays.) There are several bright true stars - Sirius, Regulus, etc., but, fortunately, none of these lie on the ecliptic.

Kids often ask me which is my favorite planet. My answer is always "Earth". This book shows why.Earth is the only planet whose English name does not derive from Greek/Roman mythology. The name derives from Old English and Germanic. There are, of course, hundreds of other names for the planet in other languages. In Roman Mythology, the goddess of the Earth was Tellus - the fertile soil (Greek: Gaia, terra mater - Mother Earth).It was not until the time of Copernicus (the sixteenth century) that it was understood that the Earth is just another planet.Mir and Earth's limbMir space station and Earth's limbEarth, of course, can be studied without the aid of spacecraft. Nevertheless it was not until the twentieth century that we had maps of the entire planet. Pictures of the planet taken from space are of considerable importance; for example, they are an enormous help in weather prediction and especially in tracking and predicting hurricanes. And they are extraordinarily beautiful.The Earth is divided into several layers which have distinct chemical and seismic properties (depths in km):      0-  40  Crust     40- 400  Upper mantle    400- 650  Transition region    650-2700  Lower mantle   2700-2890  D'' layer   2890-5150  Outer core   5150-6378  Inner core       The crust varies considerably in thickness, it is thinner under the oceans, thicker under the continents. The inner core and crust are solid; the outer core and mantle layers are plastic or semi-fluid. The various layers are separated by discontinuities which are evident in seismic data; the best known of these is the Mohorovicic discontinuity between the crust and upper mantle.Most of the mass of the Earth is in the mantle, most of the rest in the core; the part we inhabit is a tiny fraction of the whole (values below x10^24 kilograms):      atmosphere     = 0.0000051      oceans         = 0.0014      crust          = 0.026      mantle         = 4.043      outer core     = 1.835      inner core     = 0.09675The core is probably composed mostly of iron (or nickel/iron) though it is possible that some lighter elements may be present, too. Temperatures at the center of the core may be as high as 7500 K, hotter than the surface of the Sun. The lower mantle is probably mostly silicon, magnesium and oxygen with some iron, calcium and aluminum. The upper mantle is mostly olivene and pyroxene (iron/magnesium silicates), calcium and aluminum. We know most of this only from seismic techniques; samples from the upper mantle arrive at the surface as lava from volcanoes but the majority of the Earth is inaccessible. The crust is primarily quartz (silicon dioxide) and other silicates like feldspar. Taken as a whole, the Earth's chemical composition (by mass) is:Earth-South America South America by Galileo    34.6%  Iron    29.5%  Oxygen    15.2%  Silicon    12.7%  Magnesium     2.4%  Nickel     1.9%  Sulfur     0.05% TitaniumThe Earth is the densest major body in the solar system.The other terrestrial planets probably have similar structures and compositions with some differences: the Moon has at most a small core; Mercury has an extra large core (relative to its diameter); the mantles of Mars and the Moon are much thicker; the Moon and Mercury may not have chemically distinct crusts; Earth may be the only one with distinct inner and outer cores. Note, however, that our knowledge of planetary interiors is mostly theoretical even for the Earth.Unlike the other terrestrial planets, Earth's crust is divided into several separate solid plates which float around independently on top of the hot mantle below. The theory that describes this is known as plate tectonics. It is characterized by two major processes: spreading and subduction. Spreading occurs when two plates move away from each other and new crust is created by upwelling magma from below. Subduction occurs when two plates collide and the edge of one dives beneath the other and ends up being destroyed in the mantle. There is also transverse motion at some plate boundaries (i.e. the San Andreas Fault in California) and collisions between continental plates (i.e. India/Eurasia). There are (at present) eight major plates:    * North American Plate - North America, western North Atlantic and Greenland      Plate boundaries Earth's Plate Boundaries delineated by earthquake epicenters    * South American Plate - South America and western South Atlantic    * Antarctic Plate - Antarctica and the "Southern Ocean"    * Eurasian Plate - eastern North Atlantic, Europe and Asia except for India    * African Plate - Africa, eastern South Atlantic and western Indian Ocean    * Indian-Australian Plate - India, Australia, New Zealand and most of Indian Ocean    * Nazca Plate - eastern Pacific Ocean adjacent to South America    * Pacific Plate - most of the Pacific Ocean (and the southern coast of California!) There are also twenty or more small plates such as the Arabian, Cocos, and Philippine Plates. Earthquakes are much more common at the plate boundaries. Plotting their locations makes it easy to see the plate boundaries.The Earth's surface is very young. In the relatively short (by astronomical standards) period of 500,000,000 years or so erosion and tectonic processes destroy and recreate most of the Earth's surface and thereby eliminate almost all traces of earlier geologic surface history (such as impact craters). Thus the very early history of the Earth has mostly been erased. The Earth is 4.5 to 4.6 billion years old, but the oldest known rocks are about 4 billion years old and rocks older than 3 billion years are rare. The oldest fossils of living organisms are less than 3.9 billion years old. There is no record of the critical period when life was first getting started.Strait of Gibraltar Space Shuttle view of the Strait of Gibraltar71 Percent of the Earth's surface is covered with water. Earth is the only planet on which water can exist in liquid form on the surface (though there may be liquid ethane or methane on Titan's surface and liquid water beneath the surface of Europa). Liquid water is, of course, essential for life as we know it. The heat capacity of the oceans is also very important in keeping the Earth's temperature relatively stable. Liquid water is also responsible for most of the erosion and weathering of the Earth's continents, a process unique in the solar system today (though it may have occurred on Mars in the past).Earth's atmosphere Earth's atmosphere seen at the limbThe Earth's atmosphere is 77% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, with traces of argon, carbon dioxide and water. There was probably a very much larger amount of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere when the Earth was first formed, but it has since been almost all incorporated into carbonate rocks and to a lesser extent dissolved into the oceans and consumed by living plants. Plate tectonics and biological processes now maintain a continual flow of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to these various "sinks" and back again. The tiny amount of carbon dioxide resident in the atmosphere at any time is extremely important to the maintenance of the Earth's surface temperature via the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect raises the average surface temperature about 35 degrees C above what it would otherwise be (from a frigid -21 C to a comfortable +14 C); without it the oceans would freeze and life as we know it would be impossible.Earth from Apollo 11 View from Apollo 11The presence of free oxygen is quite remarkable from a chemical point of view. Oxygen is a very reactive gas and under "normal" circumstances would quickly combine with other elements. The oxygen in Earth's atmosphere is produced and maintained by biological processes. Without life there would be no free oxygen.The interaction of the Earth and the Moon slows the Earth's rotation by about 2 milliseconds per century. Current research indicates that about 900 million years ago there were 481 18-hour days in a year.Earth has a modest magnetic field produced by electric currents in the outer core. The interaction of the solar wind, the Earth's magnetic field and the Earth's upper atmosphere causes the auroras (see the Interplanetary Medium). Irregularities in these factors cause the magnetic poles to move and even reverse relative to the surface; the geomagnetic north pole is currently located in northern Canada. (The "geomagnetic north pole" is the position on the Earth's surface directly above the south pole of the Earth's field; see this diagram.)The Earth's magnetic field and its interaction with the solar wind also produce the Van Allen radiation belts, a pair of doughnut shaped rings of ionized gas (or plasma) trapped in orbit around the Earth. The outer belt stretches from 19,000 km in altitude to 41,000 km; the inner belt lies between 13,000 km and 7,600 km in altitude.Earth's SatelliteEarth has only one natural satellite, the Moon. But    * thousands of small artificial satellites have also been placed in orbit around the Earth.    * Asteroids 3753 Cruithne and 2002 AA29 have complicated orbital relationships with the Earth; they're not really moons, the term "companion" is being used. It is somewhat similar to the situation with Saturn's moons Janus and Epimetheus.    * Lilith doesn't exist but it's an interesting story. Open Issues    * Our knowledge of the interior of the Earth is derived almost entirely from highly indirect evidence. How can we get more information?    * Despite substantial increases in the solar "constant" the average temperature on the surface of the Earth has remained very stable for several billion years. The best theory is that this has been accomplished by varying the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to regulate the greenhouse effect. But just how is this done? The Gaia Hypothesis asserts that the biosphere actively regulates it. More detailed information about Venus and Mars may provide clues.    * How much more carbon dioxide can we dump Our solar system consists of various bodies of different sizes which orbit the sun. The planets are the most important of these orbiting objects, and are arrayed in this order (first is closest to the sun): Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.starteachastronomy.com/solar.html<TEXT>S U NThe SUN, which is actually just an ordinary star, lies at the center of our solar system. What makes the sun so special to us is simply the fact that it is so close to the Earth, only 93 million (92,960,000) miles away. This distance may seem huge, but when you realize that the closest star to us besides the sun is 25.3 trillion (25,300,000,000,000) miles away, you can see how giant space really is. Besides the obvious effects the sun has on our lives, solar activity also contributes to weather patterns on Earth. For instance, between the years 1640 and 1710, there were almost no sunspots on the surface of the sun. This coincided with a period of very cold weather on Earth known as the "Little Ice Age." Solar eclipses are particularly fascinating to watch. During a solar eclipse, the moon, the Earth, and the sun line up so that the moon lies between the sun and Earth. From our point of view on Earth, the sun is blocked completely by the moon for a few minutes. Another beautiful sight visible from Earth are the aurorae, or northern lights. These brightly colored bands usually appear in the sky in locations near the north and south poles. The bright colors occur when high-energy particles from the sun are swept into our atmosphere and make the atoms there glow. The sun gets its energy from nuclear fusion, which is a nuclear process where four hydrogen atoms are converted into one helium atom. Since the total atomic mass of four hydrogen atoms is 0.7 percent more than the atomic mass of the helium atom, there is a little bit of extra mass left over at the end of this conversion process. In his famous E = mc^2 equation, Einstein proved that mass and energy are transferable. The extra mass created in the nuclear process described above is converted into energy. This nuclear fusion occurs in the central core of the sun, where the temperature is about 15 million degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 250 billion times the pressure of the Earth's atmosphere.The Sun (NASA)M E R C U R YMERCURY is the closest planet to the sun, and so it is also the fastest moving, orbiting the sun at 107,136 mph. This fast speed led the Romans to name it after Mercury, who was the speedy messenger of the Roman gods. Since Mercury is so close to the sun, it is difficult to see from Earth. It is visible only right after sunset or right before sunrise. Mercury has no moons. Nearly 4,000 of the best photographs of Mercury were taken by the Mariner 10 space mission in 1974. Those pictures show that Mercury is a small rock that resembles the moon. However, it has long cliffs and shallow craters instead of the deep craters found on the moon. At the center of the planet is a large iron core. One year on Mercury is only 88 Earth days long, while one day on Mercury is equal to 59 days on Earth! This means that since Mercury has no atmosphere, and the sun shines continuously on the surface for 59 Earth days in a row, the daytime temperatures on Mercury can reach as high as 800 degrees Fahrenheit, under which conditions even metals such as lead would be melted! When it is nighttime on the surface, the temperature is -250 degrees Fahrenheit!Mercury (NASA)V E N U SVENUS is the closest planet to Earth, and is the third brightest object in our sky after the sun and moon. Although it is similar to our planet in size, mass, and density, its surface environment is quite different. The atmosphere is made up of 96% carbon dioxide and small amounts of acids. One feature of the atmosphere is the greenhouse effect, in which heat (infrared radiation) is trapped near the surface because it gets reflected back down by the clouds. Venus is therefore very hot, approximately 900 degrees Fahrenheit. The surface has been studied by the Pioneer Venus 1 and Magellan spacecrafts, which used radar to peer through the clouds and make maps. They found that most of the surface is covered by craters and hills. There are also indications that Venus had a lot of volcanic activity in the past. The atmospheric pressure at the surface is 90 times Earth's pressure! Venus does not have any moons.Venus (NASA)E A R T HOur planet, EARTH, is very unique. The environment is rich enough to support life, and many life forms thrive. Unlike any of the other planets, Earth is covered by vast quantities of water. In fact, more than 70% of the surface is under the ocean. Temperatures on Earth are very moderate compared to the other planets. Humans can live relatively comfortably at almost any location on the surface. Our only moon is a quarter the size of Earth. It rotates on its axis at exactly the same rate that it orbits the Earth, and so we always see the same side of the moon. There is no air or water on the surface of the moon, and there is also no geological activity. The moon is the only other place in the universe that people have traveled to.Earth (NASA)M A R SMARS is a rocky red planet about half the size of Earth. It orbits the sun every 1.88 Earth years, and a day on Mars lasts about as long as one on Earth does. The planet's axis of rotation is also similar to the Earth's, which means that Mars experiences seasons as well. One unique feature is the polar ice caps, which are a combination of water ice and frozen carbon dioxide. The ice caps melt and rebuild according to the seasons, just as they do on Earth. The surface features on Mars are huge: the Valles Marinaris is a valley longer than the whole United States, and Olympus Mons is a volcano larger than Arizona and three times higher than the Hawaiian Island volcanoes. Three spacecraft have landed on Mars, and they have sent back pictures of a relatively flat surface covered with red rocks. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are probably asteroids captured by Mars' orbit long ago.Mars (NASA)A S T E R O I D SThe ASTEROID BELT lies between Mars and Jupiter. The first asteroids, or minor planets, were discovered in the very early 1800s. Eventually over 4,000 of them were found. Astronomers had calculated that another planet should lie between Mars and Jupiter, and the asteroid belt seemed to solve this problem. Asteroids are composed of raw material from the creation of our solar system. For some reason, this material did not come together to form one planet. Asteroids are the source of most meteors that have hit the Earth.The asteroid Ida (NASA)J U P I T E RJUPITER is named after the king of the Roman gods. It is the largest planet, yet it spins very quickly on its axis- one day is about 10 Earth hours. The atmosphere is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, although it is the small amounts of gases like ammonia and methane which make the bands on Jupiter look so colorful. It is very turbulent in the atmosphere, with huge storms frequently lasting years. The Great Red Spot is a storm which has been in existence for 300 years, and covers an area larger than Earth! Jupiter is a gas giant with a very faint ring system. The atmosphere is so thick that it is impossible to see the rocky core that is probably at the center of this huge body. There are 16 moons orbiting Jupiter. The four brightest ones- Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto- are visible from Earth through a small telescope. They were first discovered in 1610 by Galileo, who was using a telescope that he built. These four moons are therefore called the Galilean satellites.Jupiter(NASA)S A T U R NSATURN is one of the most beautiful and unusual sights in the sky. It is a giant gas planet about ten times the size of Earth. Its density is so low that it would float in a (very) big dish of water. Like Jupiter, Saturn has an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium and is often very stormy. The most unique feature of Saturn is its bright and colorful ring system, which is easily visible from Earth with a small telescope. The rings are composed of billions of small rock and ice particles which reflect the sunlight and are held together by gravity and a few of Saturn's moons. The dark separation between the two main rings is called the Cassini division. Saturn has 18 moons. The largest is Titan, which is actually larger than Mercury and Pluto.Saturn (NASA)U R A N U SURANUS was found in 1781 by the astronomer William Herschel. Like Saturn and Jupiter, Uranus is a gas giant with a helium and hydrogen atmosphere. Uranus has a faint ring system that cannot be seen from Earth except with a very large telescope. The rings were discovered only 23 years ago, when Uranus passed in front of a star, which appeared to blink as it passed the rings. Uranus has at least 15 moons, some of which are probably captured asteroids.Uranus (NASA)N E P T U N ENEPTUNE was discovered in 1846, after astronomers calculated where its orbit should be in order to cause strange motions in Uranus' orbit. Neptune's atmosphere is also composed of hydrogen and helium, and it has a very faint ring system that cannot be seen from Earth. For 20 years out of every 248 years (one orbit of Pluto), Neptune is actually the farthest planet from the sun. This was the case from 1979 until 1999. Pluto is now once again the last planet in the solar system. Neptune has eight moons.Neptune (NASA)P L U T OPLUTO is usually (see 'Neptune' above) the farthest planet from the sun. It was found in 1930. Pluto is quite different from the other gas giants in the outer reaches of the solar system. In fact, it is simply a rock composed of frozen methane. There is an on-going debate about whether Pluto should be considered a planet, since it more closely resembles an asteroid or moon. Some astronomers believe that it is an escaped moon of Neptune, and others believe that it could be the remains of a large comet. Pluto is extremely cold, with a surface temperature of only about -360 degrees Fahrenheit. Pluto's only moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>https://www.msu.edu/~pilantpa/webquest/earth.htm<TEXT>Earth is the only planet with life -- and ongoing plate tectonics      Earth's atmosphere has more oxygen today than it did when the planet formed Of all the planets in our solar system, Earth is the only one that can support human life. No other planet has oceans of water, an oxygen-rich atmosphere, and intelligent life.Earth is special in many less dramatic respects, too. It is the largest body in the solar system with a solid surface and the only planet with ongoing plate tectonics -- the slow but constant shifting of large, fairly rigid plates on the planet's surface. These two facts are linked, since Earth's solid surface locks in the heat necessary to force the crust to move.In other ways, however, Earth is just an average planet. It is bigger than four planets in the solar system and smaller than the other four. Two planets, Venus and Mercury, are closer to the Sun, while the other six are farther away.Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago, and it is still evolving. Earthquakes and volcanoes are violent proof of Earth's shifting crust. Beneath this thin crust of rock -- which averages about four miles (7 km) thick under the oceans and up to 25 miles (40 km) beneath the continents -- lies a 1,700-mile (2,700-km) layer of denser rock called the mantle.Beneath the mantle is Earth's core, made mostly of nickel and iron. The inner part of the core is solid, but the outer part is liquid. From its edge to its center, the core measures about 2,000 miles (3,220 km).Oceans cover more than two-thirds of Earth's surface. The first signs of life on Earth appeared in the oceans about 3.5 billion to 3.9 billion years ago. The first tiny organisms may have been similiar to forms of bacteria living today. The first life on land, simple plants, developed around 430 million years ago. The age of the dinosaurs followed 225 million years later, and human beings evolved less than one million years ago.Above Earth's solid surface lies its atmosphere. The atmosphere has more oxygen today than it did when Earth formed. While the early atmosphere was mostly carbon dioxide, more than three-quarters of Earth's atmosphere is now nitrogen, and most of the rest of it is oxygen. Chemical reactions locked much of the early carbon dioxide inside rocks, while plants produced the oxygen in our present-day atmosphere.Human technology is another factor that sets Earth apart from other planets. Thousands of artificial satellites orbit our planet, enabling humans to communicate with one another, monitor the weather, and, sometimes, keep an eye on other people.While You Are on EarthGravity holds you "down" on the planet's surface and makes you feel heavy. The oxygen in the atmosphere allows you to breathe comfortably, and the Sun keeps you warm in the daytime.A huge variety of living things populates Earth -- plants, birds, fish, mammals -- while not even one living organism has been found on any other planet or moon in our solar sytem.By watching the sky, you can see changes in Earth's atmosphere, as clouds form and move, rain falls, and lightning strikes. Water droplets in the atmosphere produce rainbows when sunlight passes through them at the proper angle. People in the far north and south can see fantastic displays of light called aurorae, caused by energetic particles from the Sun trapped in Earth's magnetic field.In Earth's night sky, you can look out through the atmosphere and see stars and galaxies many trillions of miles away. You can see the Moon, our own companion world. And you can look at all the other planets in our solar system -- interesting places to visit, but not as nice to live on as Earth. </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://faculty.ucc.edu/egh-damerow/earth_2.htm<TEXT>The Sun is surrounded by four inner planets (Mercury, Mars, Earth, and Venus) and five outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto). All the planets in the solar system rotate counter-clockwise, except Venus. It is the only planet that rotates clockwise.Planet Earth is the third closest planet to the Sun and the fifth largest overall.From a space travelers perspective, Earth is distinguished as having blue waters, green and brown land masses and white clouds.Earth has one moon.The earth revolves (orbits) around the sun once per year. The orbit is slightly elliptical in shape, with the sun at one of the foci of the ellipse. The orbit defines a plane containing the sun.Earth orbits the sun at an average speed of 29.79 km/s (18.51 miles/sec), or about 107 000 km/h (about 67,000 miles/hour).Equatorial Circumference: 40,076 km (24,902 miles).Earth's Equatorial Diameter  12,756 km (7,926 miles).  Earth's Equatorial Radius: 6,378 km (3,963 miles).  The sun's radius is about 100 times larger. Earth's average distance from the Sun is 93 million miles (149 million kilometers). The distance from Earth to the sun varies from about 147 million km to about 152 million km (that is, from about 92 million to 95 million miles). The earth is closest to the sun (perihelion) during January and farthest (aphelion) during July.The average distance between the sun and the earth about 93 million miles is called 1 AU (astronomical unit.)This planet tilts 23.5  on its axis, causing seasonal changes.Earth's spin axisOne year on earth is 365.26 days long. The Gregorian  Calendar added the extra day in a leap to compensate for this discrepancy.One day is 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds long.  The earth rotates once per day (24 hours). The rotation defines an axis of rotation, the North Pole, the South Pole, and the equator. [Actually the earth rotates slightly more than once per solar day, because the earth moves a little bit in its orbit around the sun each day. As a result, any particular place to face the sun most directly again, the earth must rotate a little bit more than 360 degrees.]Earth is slowing down - in a few million years there won't be a leap year.During the course of a day, any particular location will move in a circle coinciding with its latitude circle.The local time of day (defined in terms of the position of the sun in the sky) is the same everywhere along a longitude line.At any moment the sun illuminates half of the earth. The boundary between the sunlit and unlit halves of the earth is called the "circle of illumination" or the "terminator".Earth is the only planet in the Solar System known to harbor life. This is due to the atmospheric conditions able to provide life supporting conditions for living things.The Earth's layers are divided, each having distinct chemical and seismic properties.Earth is the densest major body in the Solar System.AtmosphereEarth has a strong magnetic field. Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field, which shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun and other stars.The Van Allen Radiation Belt is an intense radiation zone. The first American satellite, Explorer 1, was launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and discovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen radiation belts, surrounding Earth.Other research satellites have revealed that our planet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by the solar wind, the stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the Sun. We've learned that the magnetic field does not fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now know that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and uneventful, seethes with activity, swelling by day and contracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and contributes to a better understanding of Earth's complex weather systems.From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey Earth's oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet's health. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our planet in dangerous ways.The tail of the Great Comet of 1843 was 330 million km long. (It will return in 2356.)About 500 small meteorites fall to earth every year but most fall in the sea and in unpopulated areas.There is no record of a person being killed by a meteorite but animals are occasionally hit.Earth's atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases.Earth's atmosphere protects us from meteors, most of which burn up before they can strike the surface, as well as harmful radiation.The presence of free oxygen on a planet is quite remarkable.bullet Oxygen is a very "reactive" gas that quickly combine with other elements.bullet On Earth however, its oxygen is maintained and produced by biological processes (life).Without life on Earth, there would be no free oxygen.Earth has a changing weather pattern.Surface of EarthTotal Surface Area: about 509,600,000 square km (197,000,000 square miles).Area of land: 148,326,000 km2 (57,268,900 square miles), this are 29% of the total surface of Planet Earth.Area of water: 361,740,000 km2 (139,668,500 square miles), this are 71% of the total surface of the Earth.97 percent is salt water; only 3 percent is fresh water.The Earth's surface is comprised of 71% water.This planet has five continents or seven if you count North and South America as separate continents and add Antarctica.Because of atmospheric conditions, Earth is the only planet that is capable of possessing water (in liquid form) on it's surface. This planet is covered with several mountain ranges.There is some volcanic activity on this planet.Crust, Mantle, and CoreEarth consists of three layers: the crust, the mantle, and the core.Unusual to the other terrestrial planets, the Earth's crust is divided into several separate solid plates which float independently on the hot mantle below (plate tectonics).At present, the eight major plates are:   1. North American Plate   2. South American Plate   3. Antarctic Plate   4. Eurasian Plate   5. African Plate   6. Indian-Australian Plate   7. Nazca Plate   8.

Note the sun is directly overhead at 23.5 N (known as the tropic of cancer) on the summer solstice - six months later, the sun is directly overhead at 23.5 S (known as the tropic of Capricorn). The vertical 90  angle of the sun's rays have effectively "traveled" a total of 47  north and south in six months time. I. Revolution of the earth   1. This describes the movement of the Earth in its orbit around the sun, and is the second major property that creates unique conditions for weather.   2. One complete revolution occurs every 365 1/4 days, such that every fourth year we have to add on one day, and this year is called a leap year.   3. The earth moves counter-clockwise around sun if viewed from above, but the Earth's orbit is not circular, but elliptical (draw on board). A flat surface drawn through the sun and earth is called the plane of ecliptic.   4. The Earth's nearest approach to the sun occurs near January 3, known as the perihelion. The earth's farthest distance from the sun occurs near July 4, and is known as the aphelion. Note that these dates are inverse from what you would think - why would being father from the sun result it being hotter?II. Tilt of the Earth   1. This is the third property that contributes to weather. The Earth's axis is not oriented 90  perpendicular to the sun. Instead, the Earth's axis is tilted 23.5  away from true vertical with respect to the Earth's axis.   2. This tilt causes the earth's axis to always be pointed to Polaris the North Star. Because this tilt is stationary, it causes the Northern Hemisphere to be tilted toward the sun part of the year, and away from the sun the remaining part of the year. It is this condition that causes the seasons!   3. The winter solstice occurs around December 22 when the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun at its maximum 23.5  angle. The shortest day of the year occurs on or near this date.   4. The summer solstice occurs around June 21 when the northern hemisphere is pointed towards the sun at its maximum angle. The longest day of the year therefore occurs on or near this date.   5. Midway between the solstices, the vernal (or spring) equinox and autumnal equinox occur ("equinox" = equal nights). The daylight and nighttime are of equal duration, 12 hours each. On these dates, the Earth is neither tilted toward nor away from the sun.   6. The circle of illumination is the circle that separates the day hemisphere from the night hemisphere. On the equinoxes, the circle passes through the north and south poles.   7. The subsolar point is the single point on the earth's surface directly underneath the sun. Note that this point can only range between 23.5 N and 23.5 S latitude!   8. During the equinoxes, the subsolar point is located directly on the equator. During the winter solstice, the sun is directly overhead at 23.5 S, along the parallel known as the tropic of Capricorn. However, below 66.5 S, light reaches the earth's surface 24 hours a day. This parallel is called the Antarctic circle.   9. During the summer solstice, the sun is located directly overhead at 23 1/2 N, along the parallel known as the tropic of cancer. However, above 66.5 N, light reaches the earth's surface 24 hours a day. This parallel is called the arctic circle.  10. The latitude of the subsolar point is called the sun's declination. Throughout one year, the sun's declination will vary between 23.5 N and 23.5 S, for a total of 47  north-south travel throughout the year.  11. The net effect of the Earth's tilt is to create different climate conditions latitudinally that also vary throughout the year!Earth, our planet, is the only planet in the solar system known to harbor life. All of the things we need to survive are provided under a thin layer of atmosphere that separates us from the uninhabitable void of space. Earth is made up of complex, interactive systems that are often unpredictable. Air, water, land, and humans themselves combine forces to create a constantly changing world that we are striving to understand.NASA, in partnership with other U.S. and international agencies, has been studying Earth as an integrated system. Viewing Earth from the unique perspective of space provides the opportunity to see Earth as a whole. Scientists around the world have discovered many things about our planet by working together and sharing their findings.Some facts are well known. For instance, Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the fifth largest in the solar system. Earth's diameter is just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus. Our planet rotates on its axis at a surface speed of approximately 0.5 km/ sec at mid-latitudes while orbiting the Sun at a speed about 30 km/sec. We experience these motions as the daily routine of sunrise and sunset and the slower change of the seasons. The four seasons are a result of Earth's axis of rotation being tilted more that 23 degrees.The changing nature of the planet's systems are the mysteries that scientists study today. For instance, the North American continent continues to move west over the Pacific Ocean basin, roughly at a rate equal to the growth of our fingernails. We are made aware of this movement when it is interrupted by earthquakes. Scientists noticed a distinctive pattern to those earthquakes, leading them to conclude that Earth is dynamic, with its spherical surface separated into moving caps or plates. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another, ride up over one another, collide to make mountains, or split and separate. These movements are known as plate tectonics. Developed within the last thirty years, this explanation has unified the results of centuries of study of our planet, long believed to be static.Oceans at least 4 km deep covers nearly 70% of Earth' s surface. Water exists in the liquid phase only within a narrow temperature span (0 degrees to 100 degrees C). This temperature span is especially narrow when contrasted with the full range of temperatures found within the solar system. The presence and distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere is responsible for much of the Earth's weather.On the surface, we are enveloped by an ocean of air that consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other constituents. Earth's atmosphere shields us from nearly all harmful radiation coming from the Sun, and protects us from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can strike the surface. Satellites have revealed that the upper atmosphere, which was thought to be calm and uneventful, actually swells by day and contracts by night due to solar activity. The upper atmosphere contributes to Earth's weather and climate and protects us from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic field, they collide with air molecules above our planet' s magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras, or the Northern and Southern lights.Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give rise to a magnetic field, which the solar wind distorts into a teardrop shape. The solar wind is a stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the Sun. The magnetic field does not fade off into space, but has definite boundaries.As you observe Earth's finite boundaries, depicted on the front of this lithograph, consider the many unanswered questions and discoveries yet to be made on our own, home planet. </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.wxresearch.org/papers/orbit2004.htm<TEXT>ORBITSSolar systems are composed of planets, stars, moons, and other matter. The scientific community accepts Kepler's Law that an orbit of a planet about a star is an ellipse with the star at one focus. The planet traces out the ellipse at a speed that decreases the farther is gets from the center of the star. The ellipse maintains the same orientation in space through a multitude of revolutions of the planet. If the planet is massive enough compared to the star then the planet and the star are both in orbit about the center of gravity of the solar system they are a part of. Isaac Newton discovered this last fact in 1666 and wrote about in Principia (A translation of Principia titled "The Mathematic Principles of Natural Philosophy" by Motte [1729]).This can be further explained by comparing two stars of equal mass in orbit. The center of gravity between these two bodies would be a point half way between them. This center of gravity remains stationary as the masses orbit about this center. When large planets are in orbit around the sun, the center is the center of gravity of the solar system. The Sun forms an orbit in response to the orbits of all the large planets due to the pull of gravity that these planets provide. The Sun's orbit is not as stable as the individual orbits of the planets but almost repeats nearly every 178.7 years. Figure 1 shows this instability of the Sun's orbital path. Each circle represents one completion of the Sun's 178.7-year orbit through the solar system. The authors have named this 178.7-year orbital period of the Sun a "helio-epoch". From Figure 1 notice the variance in the sixteen loops around the center of gravity of the solar system. This is evidence that the Sun's orbit, or helio-epoch, is variable.Figure 1 is the projection on the plane of the orbit of Jupiter and the orbit of the Sun about the center of gravity of the solar system. The orbit starts in 1820.00 and is complete 178.76 years later in 1998.76. Then a new orbit begins and is followed until 2020.20. A circuit of the center of gravity is made every 8 to 14 years. The sun is about 0.0050 A.U. in radius so that the center of gravity of the solar system is inside and outside the Sun.Jose [1965] developed a graph when he made use of computers to compare the motion over several hundred years of all the planets and the Sun. The Sun's orbit ranges from 0 to 1.5 million miles where the radii of orbits of the outer planets range from 480 million to 3,670 million miles. Therefore, the radius of the Sun's orbit is much smaller than the radii of the orbits of these five outer planets.THE SOLAR SYSTEM'S COMPONENTSThe discoveries of Newton and Kepler revealed that the solar system has six major elements. These six elements include the Sun and the five outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto). Together, these elements possess enough mass to influence the solar system in two ways. The first is by moving the Sun under the influence of their orbits. The second is by defining the center of gravity and all of the major orbits of the Solar System. The Sun and each of the five planets with their satellites are in orbit about this center of gravity of the solar system.Now that the main components of the solar system have been addressed and considered, it is important to also consider the four inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. As previously mentioned, the Sun has satellites of its own just like the Earth does with the Moon. The satellites of the Sun are the four inner planets as they revolve around the center of mass of the Sun. The important factor in this discussion is that Earth is among these four Sun-orbiting planets. Therefore, as the Sun orbits the center of gravity of the solar system, while the Earth is orbiting about the center of the Sun. One can then conclude that the Earth and Sun share this orbit about the center of gravity of the solar system.SUNSPOT CYCLEHaving stated that Earth shares an orbit with the Sun, one must be aware of effects that result from this motion. Several scientists have discussed the effects caused by the Earth-Sun orbit without knowledge of the fact that the orbit is shared. For instance, Jose [1965] and Landscheidt [1976] claimed that the orbit has effects on sunspots on the Sun's surface. Jose's work indicated that this helio-epoch of the Sun does cause effects on Sunspots.Schwabe [1843] discovered and followed the sunspot cycle from 1826 to 1843. In 1848 Rudolf Wolf developed a method for measuring sunspots. This method remains in use with minor variations today. Waldmeir [1961] gives a history of Wolf's work. Jose [1965] showed that the orbit of the Sun has an effect on sunspots and other phenomena on the Sun as did Landscheidt[1976]. Jose [1965] postulated that the orbit of the Sun caused sunspots. By postulating time derivative of the angular momentum of the curve the Sun's orbit about the instantaneous center of curvature for the years 1616 to 2024. He showed that years up to 1963 correlated with sunspot cycle. Evidence that the angular velocity of the Earth's rotation is directly effected by the angular momentum of the Sun's orbit is shown in Figure 2.The angular momentum in the Sun's orbit according to Jose[1965] is plotted with the black squares in Figure 2. The irregular curve plotted with black dots is the angular velocity of the earth derived from the Length of Day[LOD] obtained from the International Earth's Rotation Service [2002]. Hopfner [1999] indicated that many difference phenomena affect the LOD. The maxima and minima in angular velocity are absolute and well defined. There are fourteen extrema rather than four in the curve for the angular velocity of the earth's rotation. Nevertheless there is a local minima in the angular velocity of the earth corresponding to each minima in the angular momentum of the Sun's Orbit and the same for local maxima in the earth's angular velocity and maxima in the Sun's orbit.The year 1955 marks the time that the measurement of the LOD became accurate enough to show local maxima and minima in the angular velocity of the Earth's rotation. Notice that each maximum or minimum in angular momentum is nearly synchronous with a local maximum and minimum in angular velocity.Sprung made the following statement in 1880 in a textbook translated by Bigelow [1902]:"Therefore a connection between the sunspot frequency and the changes in our atmosphere can not be well denied. It is possible that the periodic changes in the atmosphere are not caused directly through sunspots but that both phenomena are brought about through one common or by several interacting causes, whereby a displacement of the periods relative to one another becomes possible."This says there is a likely common cause or major physical influence on phenomena on the Sun and the Earth that causes phenomena on both bodies with correlations or simultaneity. This is the premise of the research carried out by the authors, Freeman and Hasling, over the last twenty years.CAUSE AND EFFECTThis orbital motion of the Sun has an effect on the Sun. Keep in mind that the Sun is merely a ball of gas. If this orbital motion has effects on this ball of gas we call the Sun, then one could expect it to have similar effects on spherical shells of gas, such as Earth's atmosphere. Therefore, the Sun-Earth orbital motion has effects on Earth just as it does on the Sun. The Earth does not react the same from this orbital motion as the Sun does. The Sun reacts with changes in Sunspots and other various phenomena. The Earth on the other hand reacts with changing weather and climate. Simultaneous events between the Earth and the Sun in their orbits are shown in Figure 3.Figure 3 is taken from Labitzke and Van Loon [1996] and shows the solar flux of 10.7 cm wave length radiation from the sun [which varies with the Sunspot Cycle] versus the average height of the 30 hPa (30 mb) surface averaged over a large part of the Pacific Ocean. The curves have a high correlation with each other as can be seen in Figure 3. The dark curve with filled dots has a correlation with the lighter curve with the open dots since the former is an average of the latter curve. The curve with square dots is a measure of a solar phenomenon and the other two curves are measures of a terrestrial phenomenon.The five sets of numbers at the bottom of Figure 3 are data taken from the orbit of the sun. The quantity dp/dt is the time derivative of the instantaneous angular momentum, p, of the orbit of the sun about the instantaneous center of curvature [Jose, 1965]. Note that either a maximum or a minimum in dp/dt occurs near each minimum of the curves. The curves relationship are taken as evidence the orbit of the sun shared by the earth affects solar and terrestrial phenomena.Landscheidt [1983] and the authors Freeman and Hasling[1999] later wrote about this orbit having effects on Earth's weather and climate. Freeman and Hasling believe this evidence could provide the long-sought link between phenomena in Earth's lower atmosphere and various phenomena on the Sun.RESEARCHFreeman and Hasling[1995, 1999, 2000] used various properties of the motion of the Sun's orbit to compare with phenomena on the Earth and Sun. Jose[1965] also showed that there was a relationship between the sunspot cycle and a property of the orbit. Landscheidt [1983] began showing synchronous events in the Sun's orbit with weather phenomena on Earth without any reliance on the sunspot cycle. This orbit was responsible for certain solar phenomena and that this mysterious and unknown link must be at work to cause certain atmospheric phenomena also. Landscheidt[1984-2002] has shown links in the orbit to El Nino and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, the Quasi Biannual Oscillation, and floods in the Po Valley.Freeman and Hasling[1995] related the Sun's orbit about the center of gravity of the solar system to the frequency of tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Basin and forecasts of average temperatures for stations across the United States.Koppen[1873] showed that temperatures were lower during maxima in the sunspot cycle. Koppen[1914] also showed the same was true of global mean temperature. Walker[1915] and Clayton[1915] found similar results that were later confirmed by Craig and Willet[1951]. When the temperatures and solar activity were measured over centuries, the extended period of cold temperatures seems to coincide with minima in sunspot activity as shown by Eddy[1976]. Willet[1955] showed a relationship tendency for hurricanes to travel up the United States' East Coast. He forecast that the East Coast would experience more hurricanes in the 1990's, which was verified. Labiteske and Van Loon [1995] made the most acceptable cases for a relationship when they showed that the solar flux of 10.7 cm wave length radiation from the sun controlled the height of the 30 hpa surface over the Pacific Ocean. When Jose[1965] outlined the various aspects of the orbit he computed the moment of the orbit about the center of mass of the solar system and its time derivative or torque. This is a time dependant periodic function called the torque cycle as named by Landscheidt [1986].Landscheidt[2002] related various phenomena on the Sun and the Earth to the torque cycle. This cycle was chosen as the best aspect of the orbit of which to relate phenomena. Landscheidt [1986] first used the torque cycle of the Sun's motion about the center of mass of the solar system to show that the orbit affected certain aspects of solar activity. Landscheidt[1986] used the torque cycle to forecast sunspot cycles.MISCONCEPTIONThe fact that the Earth shares the motion of the Sun's orbit can be ascertained from Newton's Principia. However, it is important to note that this sharing has not been acknowledged or emphasized by modern day astronomers. The strongest support of this idea is shown in Rhodes W. Fairbridge when he edited "The Encyclopedia of Atmospheric Sciences and Astrogeology" in 1976. The astronomer Clyde Stacy wrote a contributing article called "Time and Astronomic Cycles" for this encyclopedia. In this article he made the following remark:"In reality, it is the center of mass, or barycenter, of the Earth-moon pair that moves with smooth elliptical orbit about the solar system's barycenter."The remark is misleading. It would be more accurate to say that the Earth is in orbit about the center of the Sun and the Sun is in orbit about the center of mass of the solar system.This shared orbit between the Sun and Earth follows from his work but was not emphasized by Newton. A need for a common physical cause has persisted. The following quote from Sun, Weather, and Climate by Herman and Goldberg [1978] comments on this need:"In our opinion, there is no conclusive evidence for or against the relationship at this time. We do feel however that the hard statistical evidence that has emerged recently is more than fortuitous and justifies a strong research effort to search for a study of the unidentified physical coupling that may be responsible for the observations."This is still the status of the link today as shown by the following quotation from Solar Activity on Earth's Climate by Benestad [2002]:"We know of hypothesis on links between sunspots and terrestrial temperatures dating as far back as 1656. This question has yet to be resolved and he endeavor still continues today."Even though many scientists have recognized the effect of the orbit of the Sun on phenomenon on the Earth not one of them recognized that the orbit was shared between the Sun and the Earth. SUMMARYFor whatever reason the fact that the Earth is in orbit about the center of the Sun and the Sun is in orbit about the center of mass of the solar system has not been emphasized by astronomers and other scientists. The consequences that the Earth participating in the Sun's orbit forms the link between simultaneous events on the Earth and the Sun. This has not been pointed out until now. </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://solar-center.stanford.edu/sun-on-earth/sun-earth.html<TEXT>"It is true that from the highest point of view the Sun is only one of a multitude - a single star among millions - thousands of which, most likely, exceed it in brightness, magnitude, and power. It is only a private in the host of heaven. But it alone, among the countless myriads, is near enough to affect terrestrial affairs in any sensible degree; and its influence upon them is such that it is hard to find the word to name it." Charles Young 1896 (American astronomer who was the first to see the green spectral line of solar corona).In Young's quote above: "to affect terrestrial affairs in any sensible degree" is an understatement. Our Earth, orbiting 93 million miles away from the energetic star at the center of the Solar System, receives only one-half of one-billionth of the Sun's energy output. Mere crumbs! Yet those "crumbs" are enough to nourish and power the whole planet.Today, a hundred years after Young's quote, it is still hard to find the word to name the Sun's influence on our terrestrial affairs. Heat absorbed by the Sun circulates air currents, which influences ocean water evaporation which drives clouds and rain, which then adds to vast rivers that moderates climates. Plant photosynthesis, triggered by the sunlight, produces carbohydrates which, via the food chain, nourishes herbivores and carnivores and human beings.More examples of the Sun's influence on the Earth can be seen via the interplanetary magnetic field and the solar wind. When the plasma from the Sun's corona, called the "solar wind," rushes out into interplanetary space, it contains an imprint of the Sun's magnetic field. As the Sun rotates, the magnetic field, one line fixed to the Sun, twists into an Archimedes Spiral shape, reversing its polarity every eleven years. The rippled sheet triggers aurora and other electromagnetic disturbances on the Earth as the planets ride the ripples above and below the solar plane of zero magnetism.Coronal mass ejections (CME) also trigger aurora and other electromagnetic disturbances on the Earth. These dramatic discharges of coronal material contain up to 11,000 million tons of solar matter traveling at a million miles per hour.These examples of the Sun's influence on terrestrial affairs still form an incomplete list. I hope that you can now see why it is difficult find a word that names the Sun's influence on our Earthly existence!This article will show you a variety of Internet resources for the Solar-Earth Connection, from the research projects to the educational to the playful. Enjoy the ride.The International Solar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) programThe International Solar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) program is a joint project of the United States, ESA, and Japan to understand the fundamental processes of the Earth-Sun system. These processes include stellar convection, magnetic dynamo action, generation of stellar winds, gravity and fundamental particle physics.ISTP can be considered a framework for solar-terrestrial science, since there is now a variety of spacecraft to study the Sun-Earth system. The spacecraft include SOHO, Geotail, Wind, Polar, and ground-based observatories. This system is beginning to function extremely well. One evidence of this efficient system is its ability to observe and quickly bring together the total picture of coronal mass ejections from the time that they leave the Sun to the time when they interact with the Earth's magnetosphere.Earlier this year, and again in February and April, the news media published reports about CMEs that left the Sun and were subsequently tracked by many spacecraft. Not only by the ISTP network, but also tracked by other spacecraft and observatories. The event in January was a particularly interesting one because it was the first time that a solar event had been tracked so thoroughly (from "cradle to grave," said Stephen Maran at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center), and it may have caused the demise of an expensive AT&T satellite which malfunctioned during the time of the geomagnetic storm following the CME event. The ISTP link and figure below gives full information about that particular January CME event, including data, scientific investigations, pictures, and media reports.The ISTP page is a good place to start for many Sun-Earth related information and sites. It is also invaluable to the researcher, because, not only can you download the latest data from that site, but they also provide some softare (written in IDL) with which to view and analyze the data. The ISTP site is also a great place to gather information on CME events, to learn meetings and reports in the fields related to Sun-Earth Connections, and finally, I liked their educational outreach links and their primer on the Earth's magnetosphere. I found a few educational links that I didn't know about, in particular, a lively and interesting WWW page about Earth's auroras; created by the San Francisco ExploratoriumOne of the ISTP spacecraft is the SOHO spacecraft, which stares at the Sun continuously from a point 1 million kilometers in front of Earth. I won't go into detail about the large SOHO WWW site now, but I must mention SOHO because of the large role that the satellite plays in initial observations of any new solar event. They have a "ringside seat" on the action, in other words.The SOHO people are aware of their role in initially spotting solar disturbances and how that information is used in predicting subsequequent geomagnetic disturbances on the Earth. They have put together a WWW page with the latest information from SOHO and links to pages set up with data from other ISTP spacecraft. You can find that page at: Space WeatherSpace weather refers to condtions on the Sun and in the solar wind, Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere that can influence the performance and reliability of space-borne and ground-based logical systems and can endanger human life of health.The Space Environment CenterMany scientists today are working hard at forcasting space weather, which they aim at being able to predict at least as accurately as they forecast Earth weather. If scientists can warn a day or so in advance of an imminent geomagnetic storm, then satellite operators and power companies can try to protect equipment, averting millions of dollars in damage.The Space Environment Center (SEC) in Boulder, Colorado is one of those groups that works hard at forcasting solar and geophysical events.They conduct research in solar-terrestrial physics, they develop techniques for forecasting solar and geophysical disturbances, and they provide real-time monitoring and forecasting of solar and geophysical events. This site is an important one because of the breadth of their offerings. Their offerings include solar-terrestrial data and images, a daily report of space weather, a report and forecast of Solar Geophysical Data in an online Web document: "The Weekly", a primer on the Space Environment with descriptions of the sun and various solar phenomena, and they have a "Glossary of Solar-Terrestrial Terms", as well.One of the most creative educational aspects that I've seen at a solar physics site is their SEC's one-page instruction http://www.sec.noaa.gov/origami.html for making an origami model of the Sun. They hope that by putting together this model of the Sun, one can learn more about the Sun, in particular they hope that you will be able to answer questions such as "What kinds of cycles does the Sun have?", "What are the four types of radiation from the Sun?", "What are some solar features?".I give this site a 9.9 because of the importance and value of their scientific offerings to the research and commericial communites. If this site went away, I can't think of another site that comes close enough to this one to fill its shoes.The Space Weather Tutorial PageThe Space Weather Tutorial Page in Lund, Sweden, aims at educating the nonscientist about space weather. My definition for space weather at the top of this section came from that site.This WWW site paints a broad picture of the Sun-Earth connection by touching briefly on each of the important aspects of the connection. They use a minimum of text and, instead try to teach using colorful images (in thumbnail form to aid those with slow connections).The site says that it all starts with solar magnetic flux tubes rising by magnetic buoyancy. That results in sunspots, solar flares, prominences, coronal mass ejections, coronal holes, fast solar wind, and so on. Their images follow that theme. They start with a few brief descriptions about the interior of the Sun (for example, by providing descriptions and links to the field of helioseismology, i.e. studies the solar interior using sound waves.) Then they work outwards with descriptions and links to the solar chromosphere, the solar corona, out into interplanetary space, and finally to Earth.Their last section on that page: "Space weather effects" gives a pictorial description about the effect of space storms on power systems, satellite systems, navigation systems, communication systems, manned space flights and the Earth's climate.The site is a nicely comprehensive site. They conclude, by summarizing everything on the Space Weather Tutorial Page (a nice touch!), links to animations, a glossary of space weather terms, and a bibliography list for further reading. I thought that the site was very carefully designed, it was concise, and it portrayed alot of information in small portions and in a colorful and interesting way. Rating; 9.9The Solar GuideThe Solar Guide is an Web "users guide" for how to use Geophysical Alert Broadcasts. The author is David Rosenthal. The guide is based on information made available by NOAA and the Space Environment Services Center (site described above). The 45-second Geophysical Alert Broadcasts are primarily intended for users in North America and the Pacific, and outline the current nature of the solar-terrestrial environment.Updated every three-hours beginning at 0000 UTC, the Geophysical Alert Broadcasts are concerned with two primary types of Earth-Sun interaction: electromagnetic radiation and geomagnetic activity (which includes effects from solar sub-atomic particle emissions).If you are a researcher in this field or a commercial vendor operating equipment that could be affected by solar and geomagnetic events, then you would benefit by knowing about the space weather predictions and how to interpret the space weather forecasts. This guide well help you in understanding the lingo of the field. Rating: 9.5Daily Solar DataIf you are a researcher or an an educator or just simply curious about how many sunspots are on the Sun today, you can go to this site which shows daily solar data:At this site you can download images from some of the major solar observatories: SOHO, Yohkoh, the National Solar Observatories, and the High Altitude Observatory, for example. It is a valuable site for the solar researcher, and it is a valuable site for educators wishing to show their students the many faces of the Sun. I give it a rating of 9.9 for high content and convenience value.The SunThe following WWW site is an educational site by Davison E. Soper at the University of Oregon about basic aspects of the Sun. It's a simple, clean, no-frills, high-school level site that is my favorite example of how the Web should be used for science education.The page at first looks like a sparse page of text and numbers about the Sun, for example:Distance: 1 AU ~ 150 x 106 km. Size: radius ~ 0.7 x 106 km. Mass: ~ 2 x 1030 kg. Density: ~ 1400 kg/m3. Composition: 74% H, 25% He, 1% other (by mass). Temperature: at photosphere ~ 6000 K. Luminosity: ~ 4 x 1026 W. But the viewer quickly notices that on that page are links with descriptions about how we know those particular parameters and values. For example, clicking on the above "Distance" word brings you to another page that describes astronomical units, and the motion of planets in elliptical orbits. Clicking on "Luminosity" brings you to a page with a diagram of the definition of luminosity, an equation and what number results when one plugs numbers into the simple equation.I really can't say enough good things about this particular WWW site. I will mark .1 points off because of the dreary Netscape gray background, but I wish all sites were full of this much content! Rating: 9.9AurorasAuroras are beautiful light shows visible from those living in Earth's higher latitudes. The light shows arise from a mixing of trapped solar charged particles, the Earth's magnetic field, and the Earth's atmosphere. Charged particles in space from the Sun become pulled into Earth's magnetic field and are trapped. Once they are trapped, the particles spiral towards the Earth's magnetic poles, where the particles hit the gases in the Earth's atmosphere. These collisions give off energy that we see as colored light.Many different kind of solar events, such as CMEs can trigger auroras. During the well-publicized CME events of this last Winter and Spring, the auroral activity was quite high. There is little doubt at those times that the activity was caused by the solar storms passing by.The Aurora PageThis WWW page at Michigan Technological University, Houghton, Michigan about auroras may be the most comprehensive aurora WWW page on the Web. Here you will find information, links, and images about auroras. In particular, you will find easy reading on the subject, auroral forecasts, many auroral images from the Earth and from space, auroral sounds, and a long list of other aurora sites. They tie in to the Sun-Earth connection by providing space and space weather links, as well. A very useful site for researchers and educators both!

There are four major conditions of the air that play a part in the earth's weather. These conditions - temperature, pressure, wind, and moisture - are constantly changing. The water cycle is the moving of water from clouds to land, from land to ocean, and from the ocean back into clouds. Climate is the average of all the weather conditions in a certain place over many years. The climate in a certain place does not change very much from year to year, even though the weather may change a great deal from season to season.      Temperature and precipitation are environmental variables. They determine distribution of species. Plants seem to grow together as groups. Maps have been made of plant growth and these have been called climate maps. The primary patters of climate are caused by fluid flow on a spinning earth differentially warmed at the equator. All fluid flow acquires angular momentum because of the spin of the earth, a result described as Coriolis force. As a result, the earthly climate is divided into large patches or cells, wet into great gyres around ocean basins, causing different climates where they approach continents and where they depart, thereby superimposing local climatic patches on the global system. Mountain ranges bar the reflected in the pattern of biomes. Specific plants grow in specific biomes. A biome is defined as an ecosystem of a large geographic area in which plants are of one formation and for which climate sets the limits. Low latitudes receive more heat and plant diversity, which is reflective of this first law of inequality. Higher latitudes receive less heat, are cold and dry resulting in particular biomes. (Use map as reference here.)      The earth is a spinning sphere, the equator of which is just a few degrees away from being parallel with the plane of the earth's orbit around the sun. This means that the intensity of irradiance per unit area is always less at high latitudes than it is at the equator. Low latitudes, therefore, get more heat, this being the primary inequality in energy supply that imposes a patchwork of climates on the earth. The height above sea level of a place also helps determine the climate. The higher one goes above seal level, the lower the average yearly temperature will be. There is, as we know, snow all year long on the tops of many high mountains, even at the equator. (Use map/glove as reference here.)      Most of the energy of sunlight penetrates the atmosphere and strikes the surface of the solid or liquid earth, where the wavelengths of light are absorbed and re-emitted as radiant heat. The primary heating of the atmosphere, therefore, is from below, from the ground and ocean surfaces. The warmed air rises; as it rises it expands; as it expands it cools. Column of rising air as it expands is the reason mountain tops are cold. Energy to do this work can come only from the air itself and it loses temperature accordingly. (Use map/globe as reference here.)      The major wind systems of the earth result from the fact that large masses of air around the earth's equator are forced to rise by bottom heating, causing air to rush in from high latitudes to fill the void. Winds represent the working of a heat-distributing engine. Heat is applied at the equator, the air moves up and then pole ward, descends and returns equator ward along the earth's surface. This system is modified by properties of scale and by Coriolis force which is the force that diverts the air through it own momentum. Coriolis force deflects moving air or water to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere.      Mountains and hills cause air masses that move toward them to rise. As an air mass rises and cools, water vapor condenses and falls to the earth. If the prevailing wind comes from the west, the rain will fall on the west side of the mountains. This side of the mountain will get enough moisture so that crops may be grown. On the east side of the mountain, however, the climate will be dry. The result is termed a mountain rain shadow. The Atacama Desert is a classic example of a mountain shadow desert. This desert is located on the coast of Chile. Since the winds come from the east, the result is that the western side of the mountain is very dry, resulting in a desert biome. The Atacama Desert is found on the edge of the ocean! Large bodies of water affect the climate, too.      Large bodies of water have a moderating effect on temperature. That is, if it is cold inland, the land near the large body of water will not be as cold as it is inland. If it is hot inland, the land near the water will not be as hot. So the climate is usually milder near the water. Inland, however, there my be great differences between the coldest and warmest temperatures.      Ocean currents play an important part in determining the climate, too. The Gulf Stream moves from the warm Caribbean area, along the eat coast of the United States, to about Cape Hatteras. Then most of it moves across the Atlantic to Europe, Northern Europe would have a colder climate than it has if this warm current did not reach its coasts.ACTIVE PARTICIPATION:      1. (Divide the class into six groups. Assign one of ;the following to each group after lecturing on them: biome, Coriolis force, Atacama Desert, mountain rain shadow, Gulf Stream, global circulation patters.)      (Students should be expected to research these topics as a group and to present their findings orally. An ecology text will be indispensable at this point and should be made available for them; however, most of the research could and should be done in the school library. All of these terms are essential vocabulary words which each student will need a working knowledge of in order to comprehend and appreciate this unit.)      2. Make a barometer with two jars. Fill a tall, wide-mouthed jar about half full of water. Fill an olive jar about one fourth full of water. Seal the olive jar with a stopper. Invert the olive jar into the wide-mouthed jar. The olive jar should be able to float freely in the wide-mouthed jar. Remove or add water to the jars so that the water levels in both jars will be equal when the narrow jar floats in the wide-mouthed jar. The barometer is now ready to use. Observe it twice a day. If the air pressure is rising, the water level in the narrow jar will be higher than in the wide-mouthed jar. If the air pressure is falling, the water level in the wide-mouthed jar will be higher. Discuss the significance of high and/or low pressure and the resulting weather.      3. Place a lamp, to represents the sun, on a table or have someone hold the lamp in the middle of a room. Turn it on and darken the room Hold a globe away from the lamp but close enough so that the lamp illuminates part of the globe and other part is left in a shadow. Without changing the direction that the glove is facing or the angle of the globe's axis, move the globe in an orbit around the lamp. Note the position of the United States at the start of the orbit, at one-quarter orbit, at one-half orbit, at three-quarters orbit, and at full orbit. The start position and the full orbit position should be exactly the same. Repeat the orbit while rotating the glove on its axis.      a.

In order to show that warm air rises, take the top off a shoe box. Turn the box on its side. Cut two holes in the upper side of the box so that a cardboard tube can fit snugly in each hole. Place a cardboard tube in each hole so that it stands up straight but does not extend into the box very far. If necessary, tape the tubes to the box so that they do not slide down in the holes.      Place a small, lighted candle in the box below one of the holes that contain a cardboard tube. Coat one end of a stiff piece of cloth with petroleum jelly and light the end that has the jelly on it so that the cloth produces some smoke. Hold the cloth above the cardboard tubes about midway between them. Note what happens to the smoke. Now hold the cloth nearer the tube that the smoke does not go down to see if it will go down that tube. Remove the smoking cloth and hold a thermometer above each tube for two minutes. Record the temperature of each place.CLOSURE:      This week we have discovered that solar radiation generates wind patterns which, in turn, affects weather. Earlier this week you had group assignments which entailed your researching vocabulary words and specific places in the world. Having finished this unit, you can now see the importance of these tests. Deserts are not located geographically for no reason, they are located there because of the conditions which cause a lack of rainfall. Tropical rain forests are warm and wet because of certain climatic conditions. Temperate areas (such as the one in which we live) have four seasons because of our climate which is affected by latitude and location.      On your paper, briefly describe the birth of a storm in the Atlantic Ocean which could effect the East Coast drastically and our region of the country as well. Include factors you have learned this week which are responsible for these changes GLOSSARY      Atacama Desert - known as the driest place on earth, even though it is located within a few hundred yards of the ocean      biome - an ecosystem of a large geographic area in which plants are of one formation and for which climate sets the limits.      Coriolis force - force which diverts air and water through its own momentum      environmental variables - temperature, precipitation, wind, and air pressure      Gulf Stream - current which carries warm tropical water up the East Coast      mountain rain shadow - located on opposite side of mountain from prevailing winds which, because the air has warmed and holds more water, results in dry conditions </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://cseligman.com/text/planets/orbiteffect.htm <TEXT>How do the semi-major axis and eccentricity of an orbit affect the temperature and weather on a planet?      The most obvious effect is that the closer the planet is to the Sun (the smaller its semi-major axis), the warmer it should be, all other things being equal, and in fact, if you look at the surface temperatures in the Planetary Data Table, you will find that with the exception of Venus, that holds pretty well true.      If the eccentricity is small, as it is for the Earth and all but three of the other planets, then the weather is hardly affected by the change in distance during one orbit. For the Earth, this is made obvious by the fact that we are coldest in January, not only for the northern hemisphere, but even for the Earth as a whole, when we are closest to the Sun (which occurs around the 3rd to the 5th of January, depending upon the most recent leap year, and where you live relative to the International Date Line), and warmest in July, not only for the northern hemisphere, but for the Earth as a whole, when we are furthest from the Sun (around the 4th to the 6th of July).      The fact that we, in the northern hemisphere, are colder/warmer when near perihelion/aphelion is primarily due to the seasons, which are caused by the tilt of our axis (this is primarily part of EQ 2). The fact that the Earth as a whole is ALSO colder/warmer when near perihelion/aphelion is due to the difference in geography between the two hemispheres (mostly water in southern hemisphere, water and land in the northern hemisphere). In numerical terms, the tilt of our axis produces almost 20 times the effect of our changing distance from the Sun, and the difference in local geography is 2 to 3 times more important than the changing distance.      This is only true for planets with small eccentricities, however. On Mars, with a 9% eccentricity, although whichever hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun has summer (regardless of its distance from the Sun), the perihelion summer is noticeably warmer than the aphelion summer, and has stronger and more widespread dust storms. On Mercury, it is over 200 degrees warmer at perihelion than at aphelion, an effect easily measurable from the Earth. Even on Pluto, where the temperatures don't vary as much because it is always close to absolute zero, it is about twice as warm, relative to absolute zero, at perihelion, as it is at aphelion, and as a result, at perihelion, methane and other volatile ices evaporate, forming a very thin, temporary atmosphere. When Pluto moves away from the Sun, and the temperatures drop to over 400 degrees below zero on the day side, and over 450 degrees below zero on the night side, the thin atmosphere freezes, and the planet no longer has any atmosphere.(The Following Is The Beginning of a More Thorough Discussion of This Topic)      There are many things that effect the surface temperatures and weather on a planet -- the size of its orbit, variations in its distance from the Sun, seasons, day and night, local geography, latitude, wind circulation, clouds, and such. Most of these factors are fairly complicated, but the two factors associated with the orbit of the planet -- its semi-major axis and eccentricity -- are relatively easy to understand.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://cseligman.com/text/planets/orbiteffect.htm<TEXT>The Relationship Between Semi-Major Axis and Average Temperatures      All other things being equal, the semi-major axis of a planet's orbit, which represents the average distance of the planet from the Sun, is the single most important factor in its average temperature and weather. Almost without exception, planets which are closer to the Sun are warmer than those which are further away. Only Venus violates this relationship, as a result of an extreme ("runaway") greenhouse effect caused by its thick carbon dioxide atmosphere.      It is reasonable that distance from the Sun should strongly affect temperature, because the apparent size and brightness of the Sun drops off as the inverse square of its distance. A planet 2 AU from the Sun would only receive, on the average, 1/4 as much light per square foot as the Earth does, at a distance of 1 AU from the Sun. Depending upon how the planet radiates the heat that it absorbs, this would decrease its temperature by about 40%, measured on an absolute temperature scale (a temperature scale where absolute zero (approximately 460 degrees below zero, Fahrenheit) is the basis of temperature measurement). Since the Earth averages about 50 degrees above zero Fahrenheit (day and night, summer and winter, Poles and Equator, all taken into account), or 510 degrees above absolute zero, a decrease of 40% would reduce its temperature by 200 degrees, to around 150 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. And, in fact, this is about the temperature that one would expect for most objects in the region 2 AUs from the Sun, within the inner asteroid belt.      Of course, various complicating factors, such as mentioned above, can strongly affect the average temperature, and deviations from that average, but if only the distance was involved, the temperatures of the planets would vary according to the inverse square root of their semi-major axes. The diagram below shows how this would work, and the actual temperatures of the planets. The diagonal lines represent a reduction in temperature according to the inverse square root of the distance from the Sun, and the various dots, labeled with letters corresponding to the various planets, indicate the average temperature and distance of each planet from the Sun. As you can see, there are significant variations in the planetary temperatures, due to factors other than distance, which make some planets cooler than the overall trend lines, and others warmer, but only Venus falls far outside the overall pattern.Average planetary temperatures as a function of distance from the SunAs distance from the Sun increases, temperatures generally declineEffects of Orbital Eccentricity: The Earth      Since, at least to a first approximation, planetary temperatures vary according to their distances from the Sun, we might also expect that temperatures would increase as a planet moves toward the Sun, and decrease as it moves away from the Sun. If the distance variation, expressed by the eccentricity, is small, the change in temperature might not be big enough to notice, but a large change in distance, corresponding to a large eccentricity, should provide easily observable effects.      In the case of the Earth, the small orbital eccentricity (only 1.7%) works against detecting any changes, but the fact that we live on the Earth makes it easier to detect changes, so we might hope to be able to see changes in the weather during the course of the year, as we approach or go away from the Sun. As it turns out, however, there are a number of complicating factors for the Earth, two of which, seasonal variations in temperature, and topographical variations, prove to be more important than the eccentricity, by factors of about 20, and 2, respectively.      To see how this works, consider the fact that the Earth's distance from the Sun varies by about 3 million miles, from only 91 1/2 million miles when near perihelion, in early January, to around 94 1/2 million miles when near aphelion, in early July (the actual dates of perihelion and aphelion vary from year to year, according to when the most recent leap year was, and where you live relative to the International Date Line, but at the moment, they are just a few days after the beginning of the respective months). With a change in distance of 3 million miles, you might think that there would be very noticeable changes in the temperature and weather, but that is not so, as is easy to see if you realize that in January, when we are closest to the Sun, most of the world's population is experiencing the cold temperatures of a northern hemisphere winter. Similarly, in July, when we are furthest from the Sun, most people, living in areas turned toward the Sun by the tilt of our axis, are experiencing the warm weather of early summer.      Now, at least theoretically, the changing distance does produce a change in the amount of heat that we receive from the Sun. It is just that the expected change, in percentage terms, is only about twice the change in distance, in percentage terms, and that is relatively small, despite the 3 million mile variation in distance.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.fi.edu/wright/again/wings.avkids.com/wings.avkids.com/Book/Atmosphere/instructor/climate-01.html<TEXT>We have examined the basic factors which make up atmospheric conditions, i.e., weather, in the troposphere: temperature, air pressure, wind, cloudiness and precipitation. We will conclude our survey of the atmosphere with a consideration of climate. The term weather is restricted to conditions over short periods of time; conditions over long periods are referred to as climate. An example of weather would be rain in an area for a day or two. Climate would be demonstrated by a desert. The weather might change in a desert - a day of rain - but the climate of the desert remains the same. We know, however, that climate has changed during the life of our planet, with complete and total impact upon all life forms. Evidence is growing that the climate zones are now changing, and it is imperative to our survival that we understand why.Theories of Climactic ChangeThe astronomer and physicist Galileo observed sunspots - massive eruptions of radiation from the sun - and noted that they disappeared and then reappeared, leading to his theory that sunspots had an effect on the earth's climate. Statistical information now available to us does not show a real correlation between the duration of sunspots and warming of the earth. The data is too new and time is needed to make a final conclusion. This is the first of five theories scientists believe have caused climatic changes in the earth's atmosphere.A second theory of climatic change is tectonic activity. We described at the beginning of our discussion the formation of our planet and atmosphere, and certainly the earth's climate underwent huge changes in the process. Some scientists theorize that the earth's land masses were at one time all connected. Called Pangaea, this super continent was eventually broken apart by glaciation. The smaller continents moved toward the equator, causing a warming of these land masses. Ice ages resulted in the formation of the earth's largest mountain ranges. The building of mountains and continental drifting takes millions of years, suggesting that climatic change on the earth requires long periods of time.That the earth's orbit may be responsible for climatic changes is a third theory. There are three types of orbital changes. The first is the shape of the earth's orbit around the sun. This shape changes about once every 100,000 years. This is called eccentricity. The second explanation is based on the fact that the earth tilts 23.5 degrees on its axis with respect to its orbit around the sun. The tilt oscillates, or moves, about 1.5 degrees about once every 41,000. The last explanation is that the earth's axis is now pointing at the north star. It circles the star as if it were a wobbling like a toy top. This movement around the north star is called precession and happens every 23,000 years. From what we have learned, it seems reasonable to accept that climactic change would result from a variation in our orbit. Again, such changes are very gradual.A fourth theory of climatic change is catastrophic events. One can look back to the age of the dinosaurs and read all the theories as to why all plant and animal life vanished from the earth. What we know of them can be found in their fossils. They really don't tell us much as to why they disappeared 65 million years ago. In 1977, Walter and Luis Alveraz had two theories. The first is that a giant meteorite struck the earth. Upon impact the meteorite vaporized and tremendous fires were started. The rock around the impact also vaporized, sending soot from the vaporization and ash from the fire into the atmosphere. Once in the upper atmosphere, the winds were able to spread this soot around the earth. The dust particles created a dark cloud that prevented the sunlight passing through the cloud. This in turn caused a cooling of the earth which froze the waters, killed the plants, and caused animals to starve to death. The Alvarez's second idea is somewhat related to the first, but a different catastrophe took place. A large volcano erupted into the upper atmosphere. This volcano erupted numerous times sending volcanic ash into the atmosphere where it was able to ride in the upper winds, spreading the ash around the earth with the same results.These culprits - the sun, the earth's orbit, gigantic meteors, volcanic eruptions - we can do nothing about. We must accept that natural catastrophe is a possibility, and reassure ourselves that in the course of 5 billion years our odds against such an event happening are exceptionally good. But we have a new villain to worry about today, destroying nature's order and upsetting the delicate balance. This latest threat, suspected to be the primary cause of climactic change today, is humankind. </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.hardcorepolitics.com/archive/index.php/t-5481.html<TEXT>Those who attended "Solar Influence," a lecture by Dr. Sallie Baliunas, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, at the Hayden Planetarium on November 26 were treated to a quarter-billion-year history of changes in Earth's climate, and a discussion of the Sun's role in these changes. Baliunas also chronicled the development of human thought as it relates to the Sun, and ended with a weather forecast for the next few million years: cold periods 100,000 years long, in which much of North America will be inundated by mile-thick glaciers, interspersed with 10,000-year periods of relative warmth. We are deep into one of these warm stretches, the Holocene Epoch, and she believes--despite current concerns about global warming--that within a few thousand years it is likely to end and the glaciers return.These periods of warm and cold are ultimately caused by the Sun's gravitational tug on the orbit and spin of Earth, causing the precession of Earth's axis, its wobble, obliquity and changes in the ellipticity of Earth's orbit. The Sun delivers, and the Earth receives, different amounts of radiation on different land and ocean fractions that change with time, triggering the advance and retreat of glaciers. The current cycle of glaciation began 2 million years ago when the Earth cooled enough for the great ice sheets--which hadn't been seen in 250 million years, since before the dinosaurs--to return. Our species appeared about 200,000 years ago; our intelligence leapt forward in a relatively short period of time, largely through having to adapt to two major glaciations. Early humans wondered about the Sun and incorporated it into their myths and religions, but it wasn't until Galileo imaged it with his telescope in 1610 and discovered sunspots and the solar rotation that much about its nature was revealed. In 1843 an amateur astronomer, Heinrich Schwabe, discovered the 11-year sunspot cycle.George Ellery Hale was a great promoter of astronomy in the early 20th century. He was particularly interested in the Sun, and in possible effects of changes in the Sun on the Earth; he also encouraged the study of sun-like stars to shed more light on the processes that our own Sun undergoes. In 1889, while a student at MIT, he invented the spectroheliograph, and in1908 used it to discover the magnetic nature of sunspots. Hale built the largest telescopes of his time: the 40-inch Yerkes refractor, the 60- and 100-inch reflectors on Mt. Wilson and the 200-inch Palomar reflector, as well as the 60- and 150-foot solar telescopes on Mt. Wilson. He was responsible for transforming Pasadena from a small town into an international center of learning, and for recruiting many promising young astronomers. His most famous protege was Edwin Hubble. Working with Milton L. Humason, Hubble determined once and for all the island universe nature of galaxies (and devised a system for classifying them), and of course demonstrated that the universe is expanding, making preliminary estimates as to the rate of expansion. [Despite his lack of formal education, Humason became Mt. Wilson's greatest observational astronomer. He came to Mt. Wilson as a mule driver who helped transport parts of the observatory up the mountain. He got a job there as a janitor/night assistant, and because his inquisitive nature and mechanical aptitude, eventually convinced the staff to train him in using the telescopes. The rest, as they say, is history.]Mt. Wilson Observatory has been particularly involved in observing sun-like stars. Although starspots are not directly observable, one can detect these stars' magnetic fields through examining their spectral lines. There is now a 35-year record of several thousand sun-like stars to go along with solar records. By observing the radiocarbon in tree rings of ancient trees, scientists can determine the strength of the Sun's magnetic field over long periods of time. (When the Sun's magnetic field is strong, more cosmic rays arriving from deep space are deflected and less carbon 14 appears in tree rings.) Some records go back 10,000 years, adding dramatically to telescopic records. They reveal that the Sun has undergone major changes in magnetism. Solar magnetism was quite high about 1,000 years ago for several hundred years, then dropped to very low levels, as it does every 300 years or so. In the 17th century, the coldest century of the last millennium, the solar magnetic field was extremely low, and the Sun had very few spots for 70 years (the so-called Maunder Minimum). Earth cooled when magnetism was low; in the past 20 years, NASA satellites have found a correlation between the Sun's magnetism and energy output, and changes in temperature on Earth. Our weather may also be affected by the galaxy's flux of cosmic rays; data indicate that cloud cover is greatest when the Sun's magnetic field is least. Perhaps cosmic rays act as seed nuclei to change cloud cover a few kilometers above the earth.How does the Sun's possible influence compare to that of increasing greenhouse gases through burning fossil fuels? The 20th century was warmer than the 19th century. The past century's weather has had three major trends: a strong warming which peaked around 1940, a cooling trend until the late 1970s and warming since then. Baliunas noted that casting doubt on the notion of runaway global warming is the fact that we put most greenhouse gases in the air during the past few decades, so warming in the early 20th century couldn't be man-made; it may have been due to solar brightening. Theories say that the lower troposphere (between 5000 and 25,000 feet) should warm with the increase of carbon dioxide, but although there has been warming at the surface, satellite measurements have not shown any such atmospheric trend. One theory holds that clouds may act as thermostats, so that if there is a human effect, it must be slow to develop, which gives us time to put into place effective policies on climate change. (Dr. Tyson asked her, if we are truly facing another ice age, if burning more fossil fuels might be a way to stave it off! She responded by saying that the increase in carbon dioxide levels has not shown any significant effect on the lower troposphere, so pumping yet more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere probably would not change much.)The observatory at Mt. Wilson is undergoing a renaissance. It is the new home of the world's largest interferometer--1,000 feet across, with six 1-meter telescopes whose light is brought to a common focus--and the world's most powerful infrared interferometer. these instruments will enable astronomers to look at other stars, their starspots and flares, and perhaps even their planetary systems, examining their atmospheres and seeing how they change in response to how their suns are changing.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.ips.gov.au/Educational/1/3/13<TEXT>The Sun radiates an immense amount of heat and light. A small fraction of this is intercepted by the Earth, and makes life possible on this planet. It also creates the weather. If there was no sun there would be no weather (and no life) on the Earth. For many years the Sun was regarded as a constant star - a producer of a fixed amount of heat and light. Variations in the weather or the seasons are produced primarily because of the tilt of the Earth's orbit. In summer the sun is more nearly overhead at noon, whereas in winter it is lower in the sky and appears for a shorter interval of time. However, not all summers are the same, and neither are all winters similar. Some years bring drought, others may bring flooding. This is of vital concern to many, particularly the person on the land. And so it was when we began to discover that the sun is not truly a constant star that many began to wonder whether these variations of the solar orb may have something to do with changes in the weather. Do sunspots or solar flares or other related phenomenon really control the weather? (Here we are referring to the tropospheric weather - what happens in the first 10 km or so of our atmosphere).Much research has been conducted now over many decades in an attempt to link sunspots or other forms of solar activity to the weather. The subject is often extremely popular with the media. Countless hours have been spent in trying to convince the world that droughts or floods are the consequence of an unprecedented outburst of solar fury. Unfortunately, for each paper published showing a relationship between the floods of some year and sunspots, there can usually be found a contradictory paper showing either no relationship of else a relationship between sunspots and a drought of the same year. Some scientists believe there may be a small connection between weather disturbances and solar activity. Still others believe there is very little connection. The reason why many scientists have difficulty accepting that solar activity has a major affect on our weather is very simple. Even a large solar eruption (either a coronal mass ejection or a flare) - although a gigantic explosion by Earth standards - only releases an amount of energy comparable to what the whole sun emits in a few seconds. In other words, solar activity is only a very small variation of the total solar output. Much larger variations in the received sunlight at the Earth's surface are due to the Earth's tilt and its elliptical orbit.For people wanting a practical method of forecasting the weather, a statement by the eminent Australian meteorologist Barrie Pittock should be borne in mind:"there is at present little or no convincing evidence of statistically significant or practically useful correlations between sunspot cycles and weather or climate on intermediate time scales. This conclusion seems justified despite massive literature on the subject ... evidence suggests that if ... more data and better analyses ... succeed in verifying ... significant relationships, they will ... account for so little of the total variance in the meteorological record as to be of little practical value."There is evidence of some very small short term effects (within days) amd also some long term climatic effects (of the order of centuries). However, none of these offer much hope to the weather forecaster.The two classic references below contain many additional references within their covers, for those who are interested in following up this subject.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast04jan_1.htm<TEXT>January 4, 2001 -- This morning at 5 o'clock Eastern Standard time (0900 UT) Earth made its annual closest approach to the Sun -- an event astronomers call perihelion. Northerners shouldn't expect any relief from the cold, however. Although sunlight falling on Earth will be slightly more intense today than it is in July, winter will continue unabated."Seasonal weather patterns are shaped primarily by the 23.5-degree tilt of our planet's spin axis, not by Earth's elliptical orbit," explains George Lebo, a professor of astronomy at the University of Florida. "During northern winter the north pole is tilted away from the Sun. Days are short and that makes it cold. The fact that we're a little closer to the Sun in January doesn't make much difference. It's still chilly -- even here in Florida!"Right: Duane Hilton created this view of the perihelion Sun shining down on a snowy scene in central California. Don't stare at the Sun at perihelion -- it can blind you just as it might at any other time of the year!Seasons are reversed in the southern hemisphere. When the north pole is tilted away from the Sun, as it is now, the south pole is tilted toward it. As a result, summer is in full swing south of the equator even as northerners are bracing for a long winter.This morning at perihelion both hemispheres were 147.5 million km from the Sun. That barely differs from the greatest distance, 152.6 million km in July, which astronomers call aphelion. Perihelion always occurs near January 4th, while aphelion lands near the 4th of July.Editor's Note: Do you have trouble remembering the difference between perihelion and aphelion? An old astronomer's trick is to recall that the words "away" and "aphelion" both begin with the letter "A".Earth's distance from the Sun doesn't change much throughout the year, but there are measurable differences in solar heating that result from our planet's slightly elliptical orbit."Averaged over the globe, sunlight falling on Earth in January [at perihelion] is about 7% more intense than it is in July [at aphelion]," says Roy Spencer of the Global Hydrology and Climate Center in Huntsville, AL. "The fact that the northern hemisphere of Earth has more land, while the southern hemisphere has more water, tends to moderate the impact of differences in sunlight between perihelion and aphelion."Sunlight raises the temperature of continents more than it does oceans. (In other words, land has a lower heat capacity than water does.) In July (aphelion) the land-crowded northern half of our planet is tilted toward the Sun. Aphelion sunlight is a little weaker than sunlight at other times of the year, but it nevertheless does a good job warming the continents. In fact, say climate scientists, northern summer in July when the Sun is more distant than usual is a bit warmer than its southern counterpart in January.Most planets follow orbits that are more elliptical than Earth's. Pluto's orbit, the most eccentric of all the planets, is so lopsided that Pluto is sometimes closer to the Sun than Neptune is. Pluto's latest 20-year stint as the eighth planet --rather than the ninth-- ended in February 1999 when the diminutive world crossed Neptune's orbit on its way back to the outer solar system. NASA scientists hope to send a probe to the retreating planet before Pluto's thin atmosphere freezes and falls to the ground.The orbits of Mercury (red), Earth (blue) and Mars (black). The solid lines indicate each planet's elliptical path around the Sun. The dotted lines show circular paths with the same mean separation from the center. Earth is almost exactly the same distance from the Sun at aphelion and perihelion, but the orbits of Mars and Mercury depart significantly from a circle. For more information, please visit Bridgewater College's Interactive Planetary Orbits web site.After Pluto, Mercury and Mars have the most elliptical planetary orbits. The eccentricity of Mars's orbit has a big impact on the Red Planet's seasons. Northern summer on Mars lasts 24 days longer than northern winter because the planet is close to aphelion during the summer. Planets move more slowly at aphelion than they do at perihelion (see Kepler's 2nd Law of planetary motion) and, so, seasons occurring near aphelion last longer. Northern summer on Earth is ~5 days longer than northern winter for the same reason. It's a difference that goes largely unnoticed on our planet, but it's unmistakable on Mars.During the long northern Martian summer, so much carbon dioxide frost at the planet's north pole sublimes into gaseous form that the northern summertime air pressure increases by ~30%. The Martian atmosphere literally waxes and wanes with the seasons -- all because of the planet's elliptical orbit.Back on Earth, aphelion and perihelion are just two ordinary days on the calendar. There's no danger that our atmosphere will freeze and fall to the ground at aphelion, or that perihelion will herald a smothering blast of carbon dioxide. Sometimes there's just no substitute for a circular orbit!Notes: 1 AU, the average distance from the Earth to the Sun, equals 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers. The eccentricity of a planet's orbit measures how much it departs from a perfect circle. Orbits with zero eccentricity (e = 0) are circular; orbits with eccentricities close to 1 (e ~ 1) are long and skinny. Planetary orbits tend to be almost circular while comets and many asteroids follow more eccentric paths. </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.ucar.edu/communications/ucar25/earth.html<TEXT>Not long after Walter Orr Roberts was appointed UCAR's first president and NCAR's first director a quarter-century ago, the solar research institute that he had headed, the High Altitude Observatory of the University of Colorado, became a division of the new research center. The rationale for making an astronomical institution part of an atmospheric research organization was sound. As Robert MacQueen, director of the High Altitude Observatory (HAO) from 1979 to 1986, puts it: "The radiative input from the sun is the driving force for all atmospheric motions. Anything that alters that radiative input in any way is important for understanding climatic variations and other large- scale changes in the terrestrial atmospheric system."Robert Noyes, professor of astronomy at Harvard University and senior astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, concurs. "It may have been a historical accident, but it has worked out very well," he says. "The sun drives the solar-terrestrial environment, and there is abundant evidence that it affects the atmosphere of the earth in many other ways. So it makes a lot of sense for solar research to be a part of NCAR."The benefits flow in two directions, according to MacQueen. "Both sides of the house--atmospheric science and solar physics--have benefited from our association at NCAR," he maintains. "A lot of solar physics research has to do with small-scale processes on the sun. These processes are important. But people in solar physics are sometimes seduced into working on tiny little fascinating problems and losing sight of the larger scientific context. I think that being here at NCAR has given our solar physicists a unique perspective. We can better appreciate the global sun--the processes that dominate large-scale changes in its gross structure--because we are working in the broad context of the sun-earth system. HAO is one of the strongest institutions in the world in research on global solar processes and efforts to bridge the gap between the sun and earth systems."Since its earliest days, a great deal of research at HAO has focused on the solar corona--the very hot but extremely dim outer part of the sun's atmosphere. The best observations of the corona are made during total solar eclipses, when the moon blocks off the flood of light from the face of the sun that normally overwhelms structural details of the corona. Over the last 20 years, HAO scientists have photographed eight total solar eclipses, traveling to such remote locations as East Africa, New Guinea, and the high desert of Bolivia to set up their special coronal cameras and other instruments in the path of totality.Between eclipses, the corona can be observed with a coronagraph, an instrument that uses a metal occulting disc to block off the face of the sun, creating an artificial eclipse. The coronagraph was developed by a French astronomer, Bernard Lyot, in 1930. In 1940, Walter Orr Roberts, then a Harvard graduate student in astronomy, came to Climax, Colorado, to set up the Western Hemisphere's first coronagraph at a station high on the Continental Divide at the crest of the Rockies. That solar observing station evolved into the High Altitude Observatory.The late Gordon Newkirk, of NCAR's High Altitude Observatory, with Coronascope II, a balloon-borne solar telescope used to test concepts that are now used in satellite solar astronomy.The quality of ground-based coronagraph observations is limited by clouds, dust, and water vapor in the atmosphere, which act like a dirty windowpane between the observer and the sun. The late Gordon Newkirk of HAO used Coronascope II, a pioneering balloon-borne coronagraph developed in the early 1960s, to observe the corona from an altitude of 100,000 feet, above 80% of the earth's interfering atmosphere. It was a prototype for satellite coronagraphs designed to orbit completely beyond the atmosphere."Over the last 25 years, space observations have given us an image and understanding of the sun that could not have been obtained in any other way," MacQueen says. "Solar physics has benefited enormously from man's ability to put instruments into space. Without observations from space, something as basic as the variation of the solar atmosphere at various distances from the sun could not be understood nearly as well as we understand it now. One very important part of that structure--the transition region--was first discovered in the late 1960s through observations made with one of the Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO) satellites."HAO's first satellite coronagraph was orbited in 1973 and 1974 aboard Skylab. In eight months of operation, it collected thousands of coronal photographs during the quiet phase of the 11-year solar cycle. These photos revealed that the corona is far more turbulent than scientists had suspected. Another HAO coronagraph was launched in February 1980 aboard the Solar Maximum Mission satellite. It was one of seven instruments carried aloft to observe the sun during its period of maximum activity. The year-long Solar Maximum Mission examined how the corona evolves and tried to determine the sources of energy for these events. After a year this satellite failed, but in 1984 astronauts repaired both the satellite and the HAO coronagraph, extending their lifetimes. Scientists at HAO are studying results from these satellite missions to try to understand the nature and course of ejections of material from the sun's corona.Another major experiment to study the sun's atmosphere from space is being planned. The space shuttle is expected to put a Spacelab in the earth's orbit, carrying, among other instruments, an HAO coronagraph designed to study the solar wind and the mechanisms that heat the corona to more than 2 million degrees Celsius.In spite of the unique capabilities of earth-orbiting instruments such as satellite coronagraphs, natural total solar eclipses are still important. "An eclipse gives us one thing we can't get any other way," MacQueen says. "It reveals the detailed form of the corona with a clarity that has not been matched by any other observations from the ground or from space. Although eclipses are no longer the central focus of solar observing programs, they still have a very important role to play."This giant solar prominence was photographed with a coronagraph at Climax, Colorado, as it erupted from the sun on 4 June 1946.The High Altitude Observatory's most recent eclipse observations were made in June 1983, when four HAO scientists jointed an NSF-supported eclipse expedition to Indonesia. They used a new technique to measure the density and movement of material in the corona during this relatively long total eclipse, which lasted nearly five minutes. The Indonesian observations were part of a joint observing program with the University of Hawaii's Haleakala Observatory and HAO's Mauna Loa Solar Observatory in Hawaii.MacQueen says that solar and atmospheric research share a common research approach. "The essence of these observational sciences is this: first you take observations and reduce them to an understandable form. Then you build theoretical constructs or models based on your first limited observations and test those models with more detailed observations and with inferences of your theory," he explains. "Finally you either keep or reject the theory and press on. That's astronomy, that's astrophysics, that's atmospheric science."One area of common interest to solar and atmospheric scientists is the effect of solar activity on the earth's weather and climate. Climate modelers have speculated that a variation of as little as one percent in the input of solar energy to the terrestrial system could cause substantial climatic changes. But until fairly recently the sun was considered a stable and unchanging source of radiation. The input of energy from the sun to the top of the earth's atmosphere was known as the solar constant.A natural eclipse of the sun reveals the detailed structure of the corona with a clarity that is unmatched by any other kind of coronal observation.An important characteristic of the sun that was long considered roughly but reliably cyclical is the rise and fall of sunspot activity. Sunspots appear as dark blotches on the face of the sun. Galileo is usually credited with discovering them in the early 1600s, but at least three other European scientists observed sunspots with telescopes at about the same time. By the mid-nineteenth century, astronomers had discovered that the number of sunspots rose to a maximum and fell to a minimum on a cycle that averaged 11 years, although it sometimes was as short as 8 years, or as long as 15. However, historical studies by HAO's John Eddy in the mid-1970s established that this cycle has been interrupted by several long periods when sunspot activity was either virtually nonexistent or very high.Although theories that sunspots might be clouds over the sun or solid objects between the earth and the sun were proposed and discarded, nobody really explained their nature satisfactorily until 1890. The American astronomer George Ellery Hale developed an instrument that could measure magnetic fields on the sun and used this magnetograph to determine that sunspots are giant magnetic fields, a thousand times as strong as the earth's magnetic field, covering areas larger than the earth. These magnetic fields, created by motions of the electrically charged particles that compose the gaseous atmosphere of the sun, produce sunspots by blocking the flow of hot, luminous gas from the interior to the surface of the sun. Other manifestations of solar activity--solar flares, prominences, and coronal streamers--are also shaped by the magnetic fields that produce sunspots.More recently, magnetograph observations have established that the large-scale magnetic field of the sun reverses itself each time the number of sunspots reaches a maximum, so that at one sunspot minimum the sun's magnetic field is parallel to the earth's magnetic fields and at the next one it is opposite to it. Thus there is a 22-year double sunspot cycle superimposed on the 11-year one.The high temperatures of the solar corona drive the solar wind, made up of electrically charged subatomic particles--protons and electrons--that flow continuously out into space. Storms on the sun--violent disturbances in solar magnetic activity--produce disturbances in the solar wind that result in electrical activity in the earth's upper atmosphere. This causes brilliant displays of the aurora borealis--the northern lights--and disturbances in the earth's magnetic field know as geomagnetic storms, which can affect radio communications, long-distance telephone calls, electric power transmission, and electronic navigation systems. However, the amounts of energy involved in these phenomena of the upper atmosphere have always been considered far too small to affect weather systems.It seemed reasonable to some scientists to assume that sunspots might block off part of the sun 's energy output and cause climatic variations. As early as 1802, one astronomer suggested that the rainy regions of the tropics showed temperature fluctuations that varied inversely with the number of sunspots. This seemed quite logical at the time, as the sunspots were dark and presumably lowered the sun's radiant output. Later researchers worked to relate patterns of weather and climate to fluctuations in the activity of the sun, but the results were far from conclusive, and, for the most part, the scientific community remained skeptical. Apparent statistical correlations have been proposed between sunspot activity and atmospheric phenomena such as North American storm systems and recurring droughts in the U.S. Great Plains.One important development in the study of relationships between solar activity and terrestrial climate has come from recent satellite observations. An extremely sensitive photometer on the Solar Maximum Mission measured variations in the sun's output of visible light on the order of 0.1 to 0.3% over periods of days to months. "This level of change, integrated over a long time scale, can be very important climatically," MacQueen says. "Climate modelers at NCAR and other institutions are looking very closely at the implications of these variations in the radiative input."As far as apparent sun-weather statistical correlations are concerned, MacQueen is among the skeptics. "I am absolutely convinced that the only way we're going to make any progress in studying sun-weather questions is through a long-term, concerted attack on the physical processes that would be involved," he declares. "Some of the statistical correlations are intriguing, and they may give us clues as to what part of the physical system we should concentrate on. But I think the only way we can really get a handle on sun-weather relationships is through a detailed understanding of physical interactions between the solar wind and the upper atmosphere and how they couple with radiative processes-a whole hard system approach, in which each step is physically meaningful. And that is going to be really tough."MacQueen says that one of the most exciting areas of solar physics research today is solar seismology, or helioseismology. "It's a new technique, developed over the last six or seven years, that lets us do something that was beyond the wildest imagination of anyone working in astrophysics a couple of decades ago-probe the interior of a star."Scientists at HAO and Sacramento Peak Observatory in New Mexico have designed an instrument that is used to observe and analyze the oscillations of pressure waves propagating outward from the interior of the sun. "At least in theory, you can tell something about the material a bell is made from by analyzing its resonant mode-the tone that it emits when it is rung," MacQueen says. "That's what we're trying to do with the sun's pulsations, using the new instrument at Sacramento Peak. We call it seismology-an analogy with the technique used to probe the earth's interior structure by analyzing seismic waves produced by earthquakes."Robert Noyes, who has been deeply involved in helioseismology, says that these new measurements of motions in the interior of the sun can lead to a better understanding of the solar activity cycle. "This is one of the most important issues in solar physics," Noyes asserts, "especially in terms of solar-terrestrial relationships. Almost every effect of the sun on the earth is magnetically induced through the sunspot cycle, whether it's the influence of solar flares on the upper atmosphere and the aurora or the effect of fluctuations in the ultraviolet flux from the sun on ozone formation in the upper atmosphere."The observing station near Climax, Colorado, established in 1940, housed the Western Hemisphere's first coronagraph.A fundamental solar-physics phenomenon that is currently getting a good deal of attention at HAO, the acceleration of the solar wind, was first identified in 1958, at about the same time that the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Meteorology was recommending that NCAR be established. Eugene Parker, a University of Chicago physicist, concluded that the solar corona was continually expanding outward in an outflow of subatomic particles. This outflow, Parker theorized, should have a velocity that was undetectably small near the sun but that increased with the distance from the sun. The reality of the solar wind was confirmed in the early 1960s by observations made by the first scientific satellites. In 1962, the Mariner 2 spacecraft, on it way to Venus, clocked great gusts in the solar wind that doubled its velocity in a few hours."The acceleration of the solar wind is an enormously important astrophysical question," MacQueen says, "because the flow of material away from the sun takes angular momentum with it. Ultimately, like every star, the sun will spin down as it loses angular momentum. So in terms of understanding stellar evolution, it's important to understand how much material is flowing out, the role of the magnetic field and other details of how the solar wind really works."Noyes points out that the solar wind is important in solar-terrestrial relations as well. "The earth is surrounded by the outer corona of the sun," he says. "We need to understand how much material is being ejected, where it comes from, and what triggers it. These things are fundamental to solar-terrestrial physics.""The whole question of mass ejections from the sun has been getting a lot of attention at HAO," MacQueen says. "Skylab and the Solar Maximum Mission provided us with excellent data sets. We know now that mass ejections occur much more frequently than anyone imagined, and that they transport 5 to 10% of the solar wind outward in discrete belches, as it were. When a mass ejection from the sun reaches the earth's upper atmosphere, it causes perturbations in the magnetic field, interference in radio communication, and so on. We're trying to determine whether the mass ejections are magnetically driven or result from a pressure pulse at the base of the solar atmosphere. For the last five years or so, we've been using observational evidence to generate theoretical models that we can play back against the observations to refine our physical concepts."Much of HAO's work is done in close collaboration with scientific visitors, many of them from Europe and Asia as well as U.S. universities. "Some HAO visitors come from Japan and China," Noyes says, "and this is very important, because few other U.S. institutions have interacted with solar researchers from those countries.""Roughly 40% of our visitors over the years have come from other countries," MacQueen confirms. "This high percentage reflects strong ties with foreign research institutions as well as individual scientists. We've had a number of visitors from the Max Planck Institute in Germany, the Meudon Observatory in France, and the University of Troms? in Norway. We have had a series of visitors for five or six years now from the Beijing Observatory in the People's Republic of China, and we have a long-term visitor from the Wroclaw Observatory in Poland. We support a graduate assistantship at the University of Sydney, in Australia, that allows the student to work here for six months.""HAO has pursued a very strong scientific visitor program," Noyes says, "and it has been very successful. I think that success can be attributed to a widespread perception that there is no better place in the United States to do solar research." </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.geo.umn.edu/courses/1001/climate_natural.html<TEXT>The theory of plate tectonics describes the global scale dynamics of the rigid lithospheric plates as a result of motion in the earth's asthenosphere. These processes significantly influence world climate. (For a thorough discussion of plate tectonics, see Press and Siever, chapter one.) Plate tectonics affects the climate system through three major mechanisms - altering the distribution of continental land masses, changing continental elevations, and affecting variability in atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. Please note that the format of the following discussion (to page A-8) is based on Barron (1994).Configuration of the ContinentsThe distribution of the continents has changed dramatically over geologic time. For example, just 165 million years ago there was only one super-continent, Pangea (see Press and Siever, page 474-475) and one super-ocean, Panthalassa. Antarctica, today an ice-covered continent with life only at its maritime fringe, hasn't always been centered at the south pole, and extensive coal beds indicate a much more temperate climate in the past. Greenland at one time straddled the equator and the Sahara Desert was at the South Pole. Such drastic differences in the position of continents resulted in equally dramatic differences in global climate throughout earth's 4.6 billion year history.As described by Barron (1994, p. 6), "In assessing the effects of the distribution of continents on global climate, five major factors must be addressed: differences in surface albedo, land area at high latitudes, the transfer of latent heat, restrictions on ocean currents, and the thermal inertia of continents and oceans."SURFACE ALBEDOThe amount of energy reflected by a surface is termed albedo. While the average albedo of a tropical ocean is 7%, that of a desert can be almost 25% (Barron, 1994). This difference in the amount of energy reflected away from the earth as opposed to absorbed by the earth's surface strongly influences the total energy budget of the earth. In particular, since the lower latitudes receive a greater amount of incoming solar radiation, than the poleward latitudes, the amount of ocean versus land surface area at low latitudes has a greater affect on the amount of solar energy absorbed or reflected by the earth.HIGH-LATITUDE LAND AREASince incoming solar radiation decreases as latitude increases, snow and ice accumulate more readily on high latitude terrain. This accumulation of snow and ice in turn has a positive feedback effect, for as albedo increases over the white reflective surface (albedo = 65-80%), even more snow and ice are able to accumulate.TRANSFER OF LATENT HEATLatent heat flux refers to the energy needed for a substance, in this case water, to change states (i.e., liquid to vapor). "As water is evaporated from the world's oceans and then returned as precipitation, heat is being removed from the earth's surface and liberated into the atmosphere. This heat energy is ... used to power the earth's weather systems (Duxbury and Duxbury, 1994, p. 121)." For example, evaporation, the preferred mode of heat loss at warm temperatures, is much greater over oceanic regions than over land. Greater oceanic surface area at low latitudes thus results in greater evaporative heat loss.RESTRICTIONS TO OCEAN CURRENTSOceanic circulation is a primary mechanism by which heat is redistributed from equatorial to polar latitudes. Continental barriers to oceanic heat transport restrict the transfer of heat toward the poles, and can influence snow and ice cover. In addition, the distribution of moisture is affected, also influencing climate.THERMAL INERTIAThe moderating influence of oceans on weather is well-known by coastal residents, and is due to the high thermal inertia of the oceans. While land masses respond quickly to changes in solar input, oceans have a high thermal heat capacity. Solar energy is stored in the summer and released in the winter. This is another way in which the distribution and relative abundance of land and ocean areas can affect climate.Elevation of the ContinentsCollisions between lithospheric plates change the topography of the land. High elevations such as mountain ranges and plateaus can dramatically affect climate by altering patterns of wind circulation, temperature and precipitation.CHANGING ELEVATIONThe most obvious affect of high elevations on climate is the cold temperatures associated with mountains. Atmospheric temperature decreases with height at an approximate rate of 6.5 C per kilometer, termed the "lapse rate" (Barron, 1994). These cold temperatures promote year round snow coverage and hence, high albedo.GENERAL CIRCULATIONAtmospheric circulation, like oceanic circulation, is driven by excess heat energy at the equator and a deficit at the poles. Given a non rotating earth, air at the equator would warm and rise, while polar air masses would simply cool and sink. As a result of the earth's rotation however, atmospheric circulation is more complex, with three primary cells (polar easterlies, mid latitude westerlies, and equatorial trade winds) in each hemisphere. The precise strength and distribution of these wind belts are strongly influenced by pressure differences across mountain chains.Mountains and plateaus also play a more direct role in changing atmospheric circulation patterns. As described by Barron (1994, page 8): "The distribution of mountains influences the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere. In the simplest form, this influence is analogous to that of a large rock in a stream. The rock acts as a barrier to the flow of the fluid, and the current pattern is modified around and downstream from the barrier. The positions of the continents and oceans (causing differences in heating) and the distribution of regions of high topography control the position of the large-scale waves in the atmosphere, such as the jet stream, and therefore control the pattern of the weather. A change in topography may well control the distribution of cold air masses or the track of winter storms. Such changes could initiate glaciation in a particular region by promoting even greater cooling, or they could warm high-latitude regions, which may otherwise be cool."REGIONAL CLIMATEThe windward sides of mountains tend to be much wetter, while a rain-shadow effect occurs in the lee of mountains. On the windward side the air is forced upward, cooling with increasing elevation. Since cooler air can hold less moisture, the cooling air mass reaches saturation and precipitation occurs. In the lee, deserts develop because the sinking air warms and therefore the level of saturation decreases as the air descends. For this reason, the different sides of mountain belts tend to have very different climates."  Atmospheric Concentration of Carbon DioxideCarbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere acts as a greenhouse gas, trapping infrared energy re-radiated from the earth's surface, resulting in increased atmospheric temperatures. Increased rates of sea floor spreading, such as those postulated for the warmer Cretaceous period, should be associated with greater outgassing of carbon dioxide through volcanic activity. Increased concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide could be accommodated by increased silicate weathering, which consumes carbon dioxide. However, increased sea-floor spreading is also associated with high sea level. This process can be illustrated by imagining a cup filled to the brim with water. The addition of mass to the bottom of the cup (new sea floor) results in the overflow of water from the cup. Flooding of continental regions decreases the area available for weathering of silicates - thus, decreasing the likelihood that weathering processes could compensate for increases in carbon dioxide due to increased rates of tectonism.An example of the influence of plate tectonics on paleoclimate -A variety of data suggest that the mid Cretaceous was a warmer interval. These data include high latitude coal deposits, extended ranges for coral reefs, displaced vegetation zones, higher sea level and isotopic evidence of increased ocean temperatures. Specifically, isotopic data suggest that globally averaged ocean surface temperatures in the Cretaceous were as much as 6-12  C higher than at present (Barron, 1994). A variety of factors may have contributed to this warmer climate. The distribution and relative extent of sea and land masses during the Cretaceous was an important influence on atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. However, computer models that simulate the Cretaceous geography only yield a global warming of 4.8  C instead of the presumed 6-12  C change (Barron, 1994). But sea floor spreading rates in the Cretaceous may have been twice as great as the modern spreading rate. Increased sea floor spreading would have resulted in continental flooding and greater outgassing of CO2 to the atmosphere. Models of the Cretaceous climate, assuming a quadrupled atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, yield global warming of 8 C (Barron, 1994), similar to the observed warming of 6-12 C. Improved computer models will help to better identify the causes of the extreme warmth of the Cretaceous but it is clear from current models that both the direct effects of plate tectonics on the land-sea distributions, and its indirect effects on geochemical processes probably played significant roles.  MILANKOVITCH CYCLESAn important influence of the Earth's climate system comes not from the processes within the Earth, but from Earth's position in space. In the early part of this century, Milutin Milankovitch proposed that periodic variations in the Earth's orbital cycle alters both the amount and distribution of heat that the Earth receives from the Sun, and that this variation causes periodic glacial and interglacial cycles. Although the precise cause of glacial/interglacial cycles is still under debate, the idea of periodic fluctuations in insolation (the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's atmosphere) due to orbital changes has been accepted as a major forcing function of climatic change. Milankovitch cycles consist of three components: eccentricity, obliquity, and precession.EccentricityThe shape of the Earth's orbit about the sun varies between circular and slightly elliptical paths (Figure 3). The result of this eccentricity in the earth's orbit is that the yearly maximum and minimum distances between the earth and sun varies with a periodicity of 96,600 years. At times of maximum eccentricity (maximum elliptical shape), the Sun-Earth distance in the summer versus winter can enhance seasonality, with warmer summers and colder winters (Barron, 1994). Variability in total insolation as a function of eccentricity is less than 1%.  Figure 3. The orbit of the earth changes shape from nearly circular to more elliptical. This is termed eccentricity and is expressed as a percentage (from Barron, 1994, figure 11a).ObliquityObliquity is a measure of the tilt of the Earth's axis from the normal to the plane of its orbit (Barron, 1994) (Figure 4). The tilt varies between 22  to 24.5 , over a period of 41,000 years. Although obliquity does not alter the total amount of heat received at the earth, it does influence the latitudinal distribution of that heat. When the obliquity is a minimum, the polar regions receive the least sunlight (see figure 4) and when it is a maximum, seasonality is enhanced (Barron, 1994).Figure 4. Variation in the tilt of Earth's axis from maximum to minimum, and the effect of axial tilt on the distribution of sunlight. When the tilt is decreased from its present value of 23.5 , the polar regions receive less sunlight; when the tilt is increased, polar regions receive more sunlight (Barron, 1994 figure 11b).PrecessionThe Earth is not perfectly round, instead, it has a slight bulge at the equator due to tidal forces. This causes a slight wobble in the Earth's spin, much like that observed in a spinning top. This wobble causes the positions of the equinoxes ( March 20 and September 22; the time when the lengths of day and night are equal) and solstices ( June 21 and December 21; the times when the Sun's distance from the equator is at a maximum) to vary about Earth's orbit. Figure 5 represents this precession of the equinox. The precession of the equinoxes has periods of 19,000 and 23,000 years.Figure 5. Precession of the equinoxes. Owing to axial precession and to other astronomical movements, the positions of the equinox and solstice shift slowly around Earth's elliptical orbit, and complete one full cycle about every 22,000 years. Eleven thousand years ago, the winter solstice occurred near one end of the orbit. Today, the winter solstice occurs near the opposite end of the orbit (Barron, 1994, figure 11c).Figure 6. Variations in Earth's orbital elements, eccentricity, tilt (obliquity), and time of perihelion (precession of the equinoxes) computed for the last 500,000 years with a computer program written by Tamara Ledley and Starley Thompson (Barron, 1994, figure 12).Although eccentricity, tilt, and precession only produce minor changes in the Earth's total insolation, they greatly affect its local distribution and timing (seasonal cycle). Figure 7 illustrates the variability in insolation in the Northern Hemisphere over the past 500,000 years as a result of Milankovitch forcing. These changes can have a pronounced affect on the climate system.Figure 7. Variations in insolation (in watts per square meter) determined from the variation in Earth's orbital elements (Barron, 1994, figure 13).An example of astronomical cycles recorded by proxy dataMuch scientific investigation has concentrated on whether Milankovitch cycles act as the "pacemaker of the ice ages." A primary source of data is recovered from the calcareous shells of microscopic marine organisms. When these organisms precipitate their shells they preserve a record of the oxygen isotopic composition of the ocean water in which they grew. The oxygen isotopic composition of the ocean, in turn, reflects a combination of processes, including seawater temperature and the volume of seawater stored on land as glacial ice. During evaporation, water containing the lighter isotope of oxygen (16O), is preferentially evaporated, so precipitation is enriched in 16O. During glacial intervals, more 16O is locked up as ice on land, and the oceans become enriched in 18O. Thus the oxygen isotopic composition of calcareous organisms recovered from marine sediment cores serves as a proxy record of seawater chemistry, ocean temperature, and glacial ice volume. The record illustrated in figure 8 reveals the rhythmic nature of glaciation over the past 700,000 years. Remarkably enough, this rhythm occurs at intervals of 19,000, 24,000, 43,000, and 100,000 years.Figure 8. Oxygen isotopic record for the last 700,000 years illustrating glacial/interglacial cycles (after Emiliani, 1978). The isotopic measurements were performed on the calcareous skeletons of marine zooplankton. Higher numbers indicate interglacial periods. Note the troughs are approximately 100,000 years apart (Barron, 1994, figure 10).The story, of course, is not quite so simple. So far, we have been unable to determine the physical tie between changes in insolation and glaciation that would explain the observed statistical relationship between astronomical cycles and glacial data. The relatively small changes in insolation do not, by themselves, appear to be capable of causing continental glaciation. Either they act as a trigger mechanism, or are magnified by other processes to produce glaciation. In addition, some feedbacks may produce cyclic behavior even if the causative factors were not periodic. At this point, our computer models are too simplistic, and are not capable of modeling all the positive and negative feedbacks involved.  VOLCANOESThe ability of volcanic eruptions to alter landscapes and cause devastation is well known, but volcanoes can also cause significant changes in climate. They do this by increasing the amount of silicate-dust particles (produced from the fragmentation of quenched magma to volcanic ash) and sulfuric-acid aerosols (derived from the conversion of volcanic sulfur dioxide gas to sulfuric acid liquid particles) in the atmosphere. The injection of sulfuric acid aerosols to the stratosphere, in particular can cause significant short-term changes in global climatic.These aerosols, when injected into the stratosphere (upper atmosphere, between ~11-50 km altitude), absorb and backscatter incoming solar radiation, and absorb outgoing infrared radiation emitted from the Earth. While this absorption of radiation increases stratospheric temperatures, these aerosols also block the incoming solar radiation, creating a concomitant cooling in the lower atmosphere. Studies have shown that volcanic emissions from massive eruptions can reduce global surface temperatures by several degrees Celsius for a few years. For example, Sigurdsson (1990) suggests that an eruption emitting 1012 kg of sulfuric acid could cool surface temperatures by 3-4  C. However, this volume of aerosols is significantly larger than any known historically recent eruption.Different types of volcanoes produce different aerosols. Basaltic fissure eruptions (for example 'spreading center' eruptions like those in Iceland) have a higher sulfur yield and can therefore affect climate to a greater degree than silicate-rich eruptions, like those of island arcs (Mouginis-Mark et al., 1993) Therefore, not only do volcanoes in general need to be considered in climate change studies, but also their tectonic setting and magma chemistry (Mouginis-Mark et al., 1993). An example of this is seen by comparing two volcanic eruptions of similar size: the Mount St. Helens eruption of 1980 and the Mexican El Chichon eruption of 1982. Both eruptions ejected relatively small amounts of magma (0.3 to 0.4 km3 ) but the El Chichon eruption was significantly more sulfur rich. The Mount St. Helens eruption produced no significant climatic changes, while the El Chichon eruption exploded about 20 Mt of sulfuric acid into the stratosphere, lowering surface temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere by a few tenths of a degree Celsius for about one year (Rampino, Self, and Stothers, 1988).Recognition of the climatic changes associated with volcanic eruptions can be traced back to 1783, when Benjamin Franklin observed the "dry fog" in Europe following the Laki Fissure eruption in Iceland. In fact, historical records are quite useful to re-write the history of the effects of past eruptions on past climates. Records that describe prolonged darkness, cold summers and colder winters, failed crops, and famine, all indicate post-eruption conditions. After the 1883 Krakatoa eruption, observations of atmospheric optical phenomenon were made, including blurring of celestial objects, an odd bluish color of the sun, and extreme sunrises and sunsets (Rampino, Self and Stothers, 1988).Examples of climate change due to past volcanic eruptionsPerhaps one of the best known climatic alterations due to a volcanic eruption is the year 1816; the "year without a summer" following the 1815 Tambora eruption on Sumbawa Island in Indonesia. Tambora is one of the largest known eruptions in the past 10,000 years (Rampino, Self, and Stothers, 1988). It produced ash fallout over a 4x105 km2 area and caused darkness for about 2 days as far away as 600 km from the volcano. Studies including tree ring observations, indicate that the 1816 summer was approximately 1.5  C cooler than the summer of 1815. The year following the eruption was one of hardship felt across the globe. The summer was cold and wet in western Europe, crops failed, people starved, disease spread and social unrest grew (Rampino, Self, and Stothers, 1988).The volcanic eruption noted by Benjamin Franklin, the Icelandic Laki fissure eruption of 1783, was a very unusual event. The eruption began in June and lasted for about eight months. The eruptions were not continuously violent, instead they were a lava-flow type (Rampino, Self, and Stothers, 1988). The fog that Franklin described was seen as far away as Asia and North Africa. Although this was a less violent eruption, its effects were drastic. In Iceland, crops failed, 75% of the livestock died, and 1/4 of the Icelandic people died due to starvation and disease. The winter following the eruption was the coldest in 225 years.  SOLAR ACTIVITYVariations in the Earth's orbit about the sun (Milankovitch cycles) were previously, discussed as one external factor in climatic change. But the Sun itself is another external forcing function on the climate system. As Sun activity varies, the Earth experiences variations in the amount of energy it receives.Solar activity varies slightly, causing changes in the output of solar radiation and hence the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's outer atmosphere. When solar activity is high, the solar wind deflects the cosmic rays that produce the cosmogenic isotopes 14 C and 10Be. Therefore, times of high solar activity result in decreased amounts of cosmogenic isotopes reaching the Earth's surface. Historical variations in solar activity can be measured from 14C and 10Be isotopes found in tree rings and ice cores respectively. Solar variability also can be estimated through records of sunspot counts. Sunspots are dark, cool areas on the Sun, abundant when the Sun is active. Sunspots appear to have an 11 year cycle, with a sunspot number minimum occurring every 11 years (the exact length of the cycle depends upon the solar activity, high activity yields shorter cycles).Variations in solar activity have the potential to affect the temperature of the Earth. Current experiments with computer models indicate that a 4  C change in surface temperatures would follow a 2% change in the solar constant (Rind and Overpeck, 1993). Plots of smoothed sunspot cycle length and Northern Hemisphere temperature anomalies between 1861 and 1989 display an excellent correlation, although a specific cause and effect relationship has not been determined (Friis-Christensen and Lassen, 1991).An example of the influence of solar variability on paleoclimateThe Little Ice Age was a time between the 13 th to 19th centuries during which many parts of the globe recorded global cooling. Glaciers expanded, crops failed, rivers such as the Thames in London froze over, and colonies in Greenland died out due to the increasingly harsh climate. The Little Ice Age is an exciting event to study because it occurred recently enough that many diverse sources of data yield climate information, including dates of harvests, fishing catch records, and paintings of advancing mountain glaciers. Geological data are also available from the time of the Little Ice Age, from polar and high altitude ice cores, tree rings, deep-sea sediments, and corals. The ability to compare and contrast the historical and geological data for the Little Ice Age makes this climatic event one of the most fruitful for developing an understanding of our system of proxy data. The actual "cause" of the Little Ice Age is still under debate. However, it does correspond in time to the Maunder Minimum, a period of decreased solar activity. Estimates of the magnitude of cooling during the Little Ice Age are from 0.5  C to 1.5  C (Rind and Overpeck, 1993), while models of the Maunder Minimum insolation reduction of 0.25% only yield a 0.45  C temperature drop. Therefore, if the estimates of temperature for the Little Ice Age are assumed correct, the Maunder Minimum was not acting alone as a forcing function. Other proposed contributing forcing functions include increased volcanic aerosols such as those from the Tambora eruption of 1815, and changes in the ocean's heat transport circulation patterns.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://calvin.st-andrews.ac.uk/external_relations/news_article.cfm?reference=218<TEXT>A study by St Andrews solar scientists to establish why one of the most dramatic forms of solar phenomena occurs could lead to a significant contribution to the development of 'space weather forecasts'.Such forecasts predict whether 'solar eruptions' may have hazardous effects, such as radiation exposure to astronauts in orbit, short-circuiting of satellites in space and power loss on Earth.The project, which has just received over 65,000 funding from the European Commission, is led by Dr Thomas Neukirch and his colleague Dr Jean-Claude Thelen at the University of St Andrews.Their research will involve mathematical modeling of such phenomena using sophisticated analytical techniques and computational experiments on supercomputers to explain and understand observations of the Sun from satellites in space and observatories on Earth.The study will look at how and why sudden eruptions of Solar Prominences occur so that predictions of future eruptions can eventually be made.The project is part of a much larger research effort of the St Andrews University Solar Theory Group to understand the Sun's magnetic activity, an area in which the group has gained a world- class reputation over the past 30 years.The prediction of 'Space weather', in principal, works in the same way as predicting weather on Earth. At present there is roughly a 2 to 4 day 'warning period' of eruptions before they will reach the Earth which allows, for example, a change in levels of power supplies so that expected power surges would not cause overloads. Such forecasting is already beginning to take place, using observations of the Sun taken by spacecraft such as the joint European-US SOHO mission.Prominences can exist for days or even weeks without showing too much activity and then erupt suddenly. During these eruptions, prominence material can be ejected into interplanetary space together with the supporting magnetic field. Such events are called Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)," said Dr Neukirch.If a CME happens to hit the magnetic field of the Earth, the so-called magnetosphere, the enhanced number of energetic particles it produces close to the Earth not only causes enhanced auroral activity in the sky but can also be hazardous to astronauts in orbit, satellites and, in extreme cases, to electrical power lines on the Earth's surface.The aims of the project are to understand under which conditions prominences form in the corona, why they can be stable for so long and what causes their sudden eruption. We hope that by a better understanding of these questions we might in the long run be able to predict the location and time of prominence eruptions and CMEs. This may contribute to improving to forecast the so-called 'space weather' in a way similar to our normal weather forecasts.There are various theories as to why solar eruptions occur. A crucial role is played by the Sun's complex magnetic field which is thought to provide the huge amount of energy involved in CMEs and prominence eruptions. The investigation of solar eruptions and CMEs is an increasingly popular study area in the field of solar science, both in the US and in Europe.Apart from general scientific curiosity, the increase in interest is also due to the potentially damaging effects these events may have for astronauts in space, satellites and telecommunication. This makes forecasting of eruptions important for space agencies such as NASA and ESA; for companies insuring commercial telecommunications satellites, and , particularly in the US, for the military.Mathematical modeling is crucial in this area, since as any prediction of future events is based on solutions of mathematical equations, using the current observations of the Sun as input. The St Andrews group is one of the largest in the world studying in this area of mathematical modeling of solar phenomena. Dramatic features such as solar eruptions whose influence extends from the Sun to well outside the Earth's orbit have challenged scientists to develop better scientific models of what is going on inside and around the Sun, although great advances have been made in their understanding of the Sun in recent years.Solar Prominences, which can often be seen by naked eye during solar eclipses, have been studied for several centuries, but their association with the Sun has been a matter of dispute until 1860. With the development of better observational instruments in the twentieth century, it became clear that prominences are a common feature of the solar atmosphere, and that they can eventually erupt and be expelled into interplanetary space. The term Coronal Mass Ejection was not mentioned until the 1970s, when viewing of Sun and its surroundings was made possible through satellites, and it became soon clear that CMEs and prominence eruptions are closely linked phenomena. Solar eruptions usually also cause enhanced solar emission in visible light, X-rays and radio waves. Such events are called solar flares.In April this year, the largest ever observed solar flare occurred, causing widescale auroral displays witnessed on Earth (Scottish pics available). The auroral displays are caused by atoms glowing in the atmosphere after being hit by highly energetic particles from the magnetosphere. The previous record was for a flare which occurred in 1989, causing the failure of a powergrid in Quebec, and a subsequent blackout for parts of Canada and northern USA.Dr Neukirch and Dr Thelen are part of the Solar MHD (Magnetohydrodynamics) Theory Group at St Andrews - a large group of applied mathematicians who study the Sun using mathematical modeling techniques and observational data from spacecraft such as SOHO (located between the Sun and the Earth) and ground-based observatories.Solar MHD is the study of the subtle interaction between the Sun's magnetic field and its plasma interior or atmosphere. The group currently investigate a large number of dramatic solar phenomena including sunspots, coronal heating, solar flares and magnetic instabilities.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://uplink.space.com/printthread.php?Cat=&Board=environment&main=284030&type=thread<TEXT>What follows is a discussion posted on a Usenet newsgroup relating to climate change and solar variability.

It also has very profound implications for our future, especially if it is true that since 1994 we have begun a period of transition leading to important climate change in the next few decades."It is my personal belief that with the beginning of Sunspot Cycle 23, we MAY be entering into a period of climate disturbance similar to that in the early 1800's, and POSSIBLY like that of the three major disturbances of the last millennium, the Wolf, Sporer and Maunder Minimums. The latter possibility we will not know with certainty for several decades. Solar Cycle 23, however, appears at this time poised to begin a major downshift in solar levels which may well cause reactions in the stratosphere and, through mechanisms now being studied as illustrated in some of the articles above, a series of reactions in the lower atmosphere. I believe that the manifestation of these changes may soon be felt as a shifting of weather patterns of moisture, dryness, and temperature."I believe it is important that these phenomena be investigated, especially as they are relevant to future world food production as well as demands for disaster relief from flood, drought, and winter storms. If indeed a major climate shift is on the horizon, it behooves us to have as much lead-time as possible to prepare for what may be to come."________Reply to Flauger from Amara Graps:"[You have provided] a nice set of links. Be careful about some of those links, though. You should make sure that it's a good source of information."For example, for one of your links, you listed a site for a source of research abstracts of a conference that described some support for your climate-cooling hypothesis, but the abstract was for a poster talk only, and the poster-talk presenters were not present at the conference."I distributed your article among my solar oscillations group at Stanford, and we have some comments for you. About 15 years ago, several members of our group did a lot of sun-weather and some sun-climate work."The general opinion from my group is that it is too soon to tell about Cycle 23. We don't believe that we have a long enough timebase of reliable measurments to make accurate predictions of global warming or cooling."In addition, there are mechanisms including absorption by interplanetary dust that need to be taken into account in any attempts at modeling the long term climate behaviour."Some people in our group worked with Ken Schatten in the development of using the polar field strength at solar minimum as an indicator for the next cycle. It does seem to be a reasonable predictor. But shorter term variations like El Nino are larger than the subtle solar variations. For instance, the long lasting drought cycle vs. solar cycle correlation would explain the drought we have had since last Jan 4, but may will be contradicted by a wet winter this year."According to one member of our group: 'The climate change started in the 60s ended 5 decades of unusually benign climate. Most long term climate "normals" were established in the 60s by analysis of the first half of the 20th century - so as a result there are often "100 year" storms, floods, droughts etc since the statistical basis was unrepresentative of the more normal natural variability. The message learned in the 1970s is still true that the main change is to more variability.'"You may be interested in knowing that at Mt. Wilson, they look at things called "torsional oscillations (these are the same as the bands of faster/ slower rotation which SOHO/MDI observed recently. See our recent press release on plasma streams and trade winds on the Sun for more details."Just before the new solar cycle begins, a new set of these torsional oscillation bands begins, too. According to another member of our group: the bands appeared very late and were weaker than normal - and in fact, while he and his colleagues were waiting for the bands to appear (last year) he joked that they should tell NASA that there'll be no solar cycle this time around."BTW: People may be interested in knowing that the variation in the sun's energy output has far more impact on our climate than the tiny increases of various chemicals. Eg. doubling the amount of CO2 in our atmosphere has the effect (on our climate) as increasing the solar irradiance by 0.1% more or less... This is about what ACRIMM has measured for the solar fluctuations."Researching the literature to draw together reports and observations would be a great project for a high school student, and there's plenty of room for Master's and PhD studies here too!"   </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.ec.gc.ca/climate/overview_factors-e.html<TEXT>The Earth intercepts the Sun's radiation, which is the energy that drives our weather and climate. About one third of this solar radiation is reflected back into space. The rest is absorbed by different parts of the climate system: the atmosphere, oceans, ice, land and various forms of life.The Earth then sends its energy out into space, or re-radiates, in the form of long wave radiation. Some of this energy is again absorbed and re-emitted through a process known as the Greenhouse Effect. The rest of the energy is lost to space. There is a delicate long term balance between the outgoing radiation and incoming solar energy. Any change in the factors that affect this process of incoming and outgoing energy, or change the energy distribution itself, will change our climate.1. Natural FactorsOver the history of the Earth, the climate has changed. The ice ages and intervening warm periods are examples. Some changes are global in scale, while others have been regional or hemispheric. There are a number of natural factors that contribute to changes in the Earth's climate over various time scales. It is important to understand these factors when attempting to detect a human influence on climate:    * Changes in Solar Output. The amount of energy radiating from the sun is not constant. There is evidence of an 11-year solar cycle (variation in energy output) in the temperature record of the Earth. Longer period changes may occur as well.    * Changes in the Earth's Orbit. Slow variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun change where and when solar energy is received on Earth. This affects the amount of energy that is reflected and absorbed. These orbital variations are believed to be a factor in initiating the ice ages.    * The Greenhouse Effect. When energy from the sun enters the Earth's atmosphere, about a third of it is reflected back to space. Of the rest, the atmosphere absorbs some, but most of it is absorbed by the surface of the Earth. The Earth emits energy at longer wavelengths. Some of this energy escapes to space but some of it is absorbed again and re-emitted by clouds and greenhouse gases such as water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. This helps to warm the surface and the troposphere (lowest layer of the atmosphere), keeping it 33  C warmer than it would otherwise be. This is the natural Greenhouse Effect, and vital to life as we know it.Image: Reflection of solar energy as it enters the atmosphere Solar energy enters the atmosphere: some is reflected. This energy is absorbed by the Earth and reradiated back to space at longer wavelengths. Greenhouse gases absorb this energy and reradiate much of it back to the surface, much like an insulating blanket.    * Aerosols. These are very fine particles and droplets that are small enough to remain suspended in the atmosphere for considerable periods of time. They both reflect and absorb incoming solar radiation. Changing the type and quantity of aerosols in the atmosphere affects the amount of solar energy reflected or absorbed.2. Human FactorsEnhancing the Greenhouse Effect. Naturally occurring greenhouse gases (e.g. water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide) keep the Earth warm enough to support life. Scientific studies show that a variety of human activities release greenhouse gases. These include the burning of fossil fuels for producing electrical energy, heating and transportation. By increasing their concentrations and by adding new greenhouse gases like CFCs, humankind is capable of raising the average global temperature.Land Use Change. As humans replace forests with agricultural lands, or natural vegetation with asphalt or concrete, they substantially alter the way the Earth's surface reflects sunlight and releases heat. All these changes also affect regional evaporation, runoff and rainfall patterns.Atmospheric aerosols. Humans are adding large quantities of fine particles (aerosols) to the atmosphere, both from agriculture and industrial activities. Although most of these aerosols are soon removed by gravity and rainfall, they still affect the radiation balance in the atmosphere. Whether this effect adds to or offsets any warming trend depends on the quantity and nature of the particles as well as the nature of the land or ocean surface below. The regional effects, however, can be significant.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.gcrio.org/CONSEQUENCES/winter96/sunclimate.html <TEXT>The Sun and ClimateOf the many objects in the universe, only two are essential for life as we know it: the Earth itself, and the Sun: the star around which it circles, year after year. Burning steadily in stable, middle age, the Sun--now about five billion years old--provides an unfailing source of light and energy. The Sun's heat is so intense that at a distance of 93 million miles it warms the surface of the otherwise cold and lifeless Earth some 250 Centigrade, to -18 C (0 Fahrenheit). Thus warmed, the solid Earth releases a portion of its heat in the form of infrared radiation, which is trapped by atmospheric greenhouse gases, further raising the surface temperature to a more comfortable 15 C (59 F). In this way, the Sun's radiation and the Earth's blanket of greenhouse gases sustain the mean global temperature at a level supportive of life. Sunlight also powers photosynthesis, and provides energy for the atmospheric and oceanic circulations that profoundly affect all living things.Like other stars of similar age, size, and composition, the Sun shows many signs of variability. Most pronounced and by far the most familiar is a cycle of about eleven years in the number of dark spots on its glowing surface (Fig. 1). But although the Sun is known to be a variable star, its total output of radiation is often assumed to be so stable that we can neglect any possible impacts on climate. Testimony to this assumption is the term that has been employed for more than a century to describe the radiation in all wavelengths received from the Sun: the so-called "solar constant," whose value at the mean Sun-Earth distance is a little over 1 1/3 kilowatts per square meter of surface.In truth, the solar "constant" varies. Historical attempts to detect possible changes from the ground were thwarted by variable absorption in the air overhead. Measurements from spacecraft avoid this problem, and the most precise of these, made continuously since 1979 (Fig. 2a, b), have revealed changes on all time scales--from minutes to decades--including a pronounced cycle of roughly eleven years. Sunspots and other forms of solar activity are produced by magnetic fields, whose changes also affect the radiation that the Sun emits, including its distribution among shorter and longer wavelengths. The most highly variable parts of the Sun's spectrum of radiation are found at the very shortest wavelengths--the ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray region--and in the very longest and far less energetic band of radio waves.New insights into the variable nature of the Sun have almost always been followed by efforts to find possible impacts on the Earth--chiefly through comparisons with weather and climate records. Initially the quest was not so much a detached inquiry as a determined effort to demonstrate a long-sought hope: that keys found in the cyclic nature of solar behavior might open the doors of down-to-Earth predictions.In the latter part of the 19th century, there were many claims of new-found connections between sunspots and climate. It began with the announcement by the amateur astronomer Heinrich Schwabe, in 1843, that sunspots come and go in an apparently regular eleven-year cycle. What followed was a flood of reported correlations, not only with local and regional weather but with crop yields, human health, and economic trends. These purported connections-- that frequently broke down under closer statistical scrutiny--lacked the buttress of physical explanation and were in time forgotten or abandoned.After more than a century of controversy, the debate as to whether solar variability has any significant effect on the climate of the Earth remains to be settled, one way or the other. This long unanswered question has of late emerged anew, and with some urgency--in the context of widespread concerns of impending global greenhouse warming. For in order to gauge the possible impacts of anthropogenic greenhouse gases on the present or future climate, we must first know the natural variations on which our own activities are imposed.THE MANY CAUSES OF CLIMATIC CHANGEBetween 1850 and 1990 the global-mean temperature at the surface of the Earth warmed by approximately 0.5 C (about 1 F). During the same period, the amount of carbon dioxide measured in the Earth's atmosphere increased by about 25 percent, as a consequence of our ever- increasing use of fossil fuels (Fig. 3c). This raises the possibility that the two trends are directly connected, and that the century-long warming is a long- anticipated sign of the climate system's response to human activities.Still, more factors were obviously perturbing the climate system than the lone hand of greenhouse gases. The global-mean temperature did not rise steadily: statistical analyses of the temperature record since 1850 reveal significant year-to-year and decade-to-decade variability. Moreover, what is known of the longer climatic record suggests that surface temperatures may have been systematically increasing since the late 17th century (Figure 3d), well before the onset of the Industrial Revolution, when greenhouse gas concentrations first began their upward climb.Other natural perturbations, which have also varied during the past few centuries, might help explain the difference between the change expected from a simple increase in greenhouse gases and what has been observed.Like the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar activity has risen systematically through the past 100 years, as recorded in the number of sunspots (Fig. 1). An upward trend is also found in the number of solid particles, or aerosols, in the lower atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels that has led to an increase in greenhouse gases has introduced as well an ever-increasing load of sulfur-bearing or sulfate aerosols, which also affect the temperature at the surface of the Earth. In contrast, the aerosols ejected into the atmosphere by volcanic eruptions decreased markedly during most of the twentieth century, compared to conditions in the century preceding (Fig. 3b), as a result of a presumably random drop in the long-term average of volcanic activity. Other potential causes of climate change include the depletion of stratospheric ozone in recent decades, again through human activities, and global changes in the surface reflectivity--or albedo--of the planet, as we modify the patterns of vegetation that cover the land. In conjunction with possible internal system changes such as variations in ocean circulation, these influences define the most likely causes of climatic change in the recent era.Different influences on climate affect the system in ways that in principle can be distinguished on the basis of geography, altitude, and time history. More often, however, the impacts of multiple influences are mixed together, and further confused by imperfect knowledge of how each of them has changed, and uncertainties in how climate itself has varied.In global average, increases in greenhouse gas concentrations or in solar radiation bring warmer surface temperatures since they add energy to the climate system. In contrast, increased industrial and volcanic aerosols restrict the penetration of solar radiation to the Earth's surface and lead to surface cooling. A drop in the concentration of ozone in the lower stratosphere should also produce a net cooling at the surface. Changes in albedo that increase the planet's reflectivity will lead to cooling, and those that make it less reflective and more absorbing, to a temperature rise.SOLAR INPUTS TO THE EARTHThe Sun's radiationThe Sun, like other stars, is a burning ball of mostly gaseous hydrogen, large enough to hold a million Earths. The temperature of its surface is about 6000 C-- as hot as a welder's flame--and the radiation that it emits peaks in a band of wavelengths called the "visible spectrum." It is all that our eyes can see, yet less than half of the solar radiation that reaches the Earth lies within this thin, central slice of a much wider spectrum of wavelengths. Our skin can feel as heat a part of the rest--the infrared--and is also acutely sensitive to another part: the unfelt but more energetic and potentially damaging ultraviolet. Solar X-rays, gamma rays, and radio waves make up the remainder, which constitutes less than 0.1 percent of the solar energy received at the Earth.The Earth's responseThe air above us is relatively transparent to visible radiation, allowing the bulk of the Sun's energy to reach the Earth's lower atmosphere and surface. Fortunately, the atmosphere is opaque to almost all solar radiation in the UV, shielding the biosphere from these potentially harmful rays.The Earth receives most of its direct heat from the visible and near- infrared spectrum of sunlight, retaining about 70 percent of what pours down on its day-lit hemisphere. The rest is returned, by reflection, back into the cold of space. A part of what the ground and oceans and lower atmosphere absorb also leaks outward through the atmosphere in the form of infrared radiation. The remaining fraction--trapped in part by greenhouse gases--sustains the habitable environment to which we are accustomed. Any variation in total radiation from the Sun will force an accompanying change in mean-surface temperature.Solar UV radiation, unlike that in the visible and infrared spectrum, seldom reaches the surface of the Earth since it is absorbed by the atmosphere. In addition, a steady stream of energetic particles and magnetic fields (the solar wind) flow continuously outward from the Sun, impacting and deforming the Earth's extended magnetic field. These upper reaches of the atmosphere are influenced strongly by the flow of particles and solar UV radiation. The changes that they feel can potentially affect the climate, through various connections to the lower atmosphere and surface of the Earth. As an example, variations in the flow of both UV radiation and atomic particles that accompany changes in overall solar activity alter the amount of ozone in the stratosphere. Since ozone in turn affects the lower atmosphere and biosphere, it provides another possible connection between solar variability and the climate system.How the Earth's surface temperature adjusts to a given change in solar radiation depends on the processes by which the climate system responds to variations in the energy it receives. Some of these so-called feedbacks amplify the effects of changes that are imposed; others reduce them. Lumped together, they make up what is called the sensitivity of the climate system: the number of degrees that the mean-surface temperature will be raised or lowered in response to a given change, up or down, in solar radiation or any other climate driver. To understand the impacts of solar variations on climate we need to know how much the solar inputs vary, and how the climate system responds to these changes.CHANGES IN SOLAR RADIATIONWe need answers to a number of questions about the Sun itself in order to predict how solar radiation will change.How much does the Sun's radiation vary?Observations from space reveal that the total radiation from the Sun is continually changing--with variations of up to 0.2 percent from one month to the next. The timing and nature of these shorter-term fluctuations are consistent with the Sun's 27-day period of rotation, and occur because persisting darker--or brighter--areas on the solar surface alter the amount of sunlight received at the Earth.This "rotational modulation" of solar total radiation (Fig. 2a) is superimposed on a much-longer cycle of about eleven-years (called the Schwabe cycle, after the discoverer of the sunspot cycle) which had an amplitude of about 0.1 percent in the two most recent cycles (Fig. 2b). The enhanced solar activity that characterized the Sun at the peak of the last two cycles, in 1979- 1981 and again in 1989-1991, increased both the overall brightness and the amplitude of the rotational modulation. The nature of these dark and bright structures, and the reason why the Sun is slightly brighter when there are more sunspots, are explained below.Still, since we have been able to monitor solar total radiation for only about fifteen years, knowledge of the Schwabe radiation cycle is less than complete. Experimental uncertainties in the spaceborne measurements allow an amplitude as high as 0.15 percent for the Schwabe cycle. Moreover, other cycles may be quite different, as a result of longer-term changes on the Sun. One and a half decades of solar monitoring is simply not long enough to detect other possible cycles of longer period--and perhaps higher amplitude--that may well be fundamental features of the Sun.How do changes in solar activity affect different parts of the spectrum?As the sunspot number rises or falls, the distribution of energy within the spectrum of sunlight also changes. High levels of solar activity enhance radiation in UV and X-ray wavelengths, and in radio wavelengths, far more than in the visible portion of the spectrum. At peaks of the eleven-year cycle, radiation at longer UV wavelengths, for example, increases by a few percent, compared with an increase of but 0.1 percent in the total radiation. Still larger changes--of factors of two or more--are found in extremely short UV and X-ray wavelengths.Through what extremes has solar radiation changed in the past?There are no direct measurements of solar radiation on climatological time scales, but a variety of circumstantial evidence suggests that longer- term variations do occur, perhaps with larger amplitudes than those found in the two most recent eleven-year Schwabe cycles.We know that there are significant changes of much longer term in the overall level of solar activity. Sunspots have been observed and recorded by astronomers since the early 1600s, and long-term changes in their number are clearly evident. Much longer records of solar behavior come from atomic isotopes that are produced in our atmosphere by the impact of galactic cosmic rays, whose rate of incidence at the Earth is affected by conditions on the Sun. When the Sun is more active, its own magnetic fields deflect some of the cosmic rays that would otherwise reach the Earth. When it is less active, we receive more of them.Isotopes of chemical elements are distinguished by different atomic weights. The most valuable for what they tell of the Sun are carbon of atomic weight 14 (14C, or "radiocarbon"), found in tree-rings, and beryllium of weight 10 (10Be) that is naturally sequestered in polar ice deposits. Well-dated records of both of these indirect indicators of solar activity reach back many thousands of years and exhibit cyclic variations of about 2300, 210 and 88 years, as well as 11 years, all of which are ascribed to the Sun.Quite evident in the most recent several hundred years of the isotopic records is a seventy-year period of very low solar activity in the 17th and early 18th centuries--known as the Maunder Minimum--and following it, an unsteady, long-term rise to the present-day era of high sunspot numbers, called the Modern Maximum (Fig. 2 c, d). By applying what has been learned about solar radiation changes from the recent measurements from space, we can infer that this gradual build-up in solar activity over several hundred years may have been accompanied by a parallel increase in the radiation received from the Sun.Adding to the case is a finding from nighttime astronomy that the present level of activity on the Sun is higher than the average found in a selection of other stars of similar mass, age, and chemical composition. This comparison suggests that solar activity can drop for periods of many decades, to levels that are lower than the minima of today's eleven-year cycle. At such times, the accompanying drop in solar total and UV radiation could fall outside the bounds of the variations that have been observed from space since 1979. This may well have been the case during the Maunder Minimum.A recent reconstruction of the solar total radiation since the 17th century that is consistent with both stellar and isotopic findings suggests an increase in solar total radiation of roughly 0.25 percent over the past three hundred years (Fig. 2c). Other studies also point to reductions in solar radiation during the Maunder Minimum in the range of 0.1 to 0.6 percent.Why do changes in solar radiation occur?Changes in the Sun's total radiation and how it is distributed in wavelength occur primarily because solar activity produces two different phenomena that alter the surface brightness, and hence modulate the outward flow of radiated energy. The first of these are the dark spots that appear in great number during times of high solar activity. Cooler than surrounding regions, sunspots "block" for a time some of the radiation that the Sun would otherwise emit. The second are known collectively as faculae. They are brighter than the surrounding surface, and add to the overall radiation from the Sun. The radiation that is emitted from the Sun varies continually in response to the push and pull of these two competing and constantly changing features. In years of maximum solar activity, it is the bright faculae that prevail, raising the levels of both total and UV radiation.Can we predict future long-term changes in solar radiation?Speculation regarding past or future changes in solar radiation is based on what we can infer, indirectly, from past observations of solar activity--particularly bright faculae--since direct measurements of radiation exist for only the last fifteen years. One explanation for the postulated reduction in solar radiation during the 17th century Maunder Minimum is that the Sun's surface was not only largely devoid of spots and faculae, but also less bright, overall. Numerical estimates based on observations of Sun-like stars suggest that were the entire solar surface dimmed to a level seen today on but about a seventh of the Sun's undisturbed surface, the total radiation would drop by 0.25 percent. What we know of the connection between solar activity and radiation, coupled with high abundances of isotopes in tree-rings and ice-cores (Fig. 2d), supports the likely case that during the Maunder Minimum solar activity remained for over half a century at very low levels.The present production of terrestrial 14C and 10Be appears to be near historically-low levels, due to persistently high solar activity that inhibits the rate at which these isotopes are produced. The same isotopic records show that the Sun seems to have been building up over the last several hundred years to a state of enhanced activity that is the opposite of the suppressed levels of the 17th century Maunder Minimum. From this we might expect that solar radiation is also approaching levels last seen in the 12th century Medieval Maximum. Still, any extrapolation of future changes in the long-term behavior of the Sun is highly uncertain, since we are as yet unable to make accurate predictions of the level of solar activity in even the next eleven-year cycle, which will reach a maximum in about the year 2000. Whether solar activity will remain in coming decades at its present high level- -as is sometimes inferred from statistical projections of the isotope records--or decline toward another Maunder-like minimum is simply not known. Moreover, other mechanisms may be at work to modulate the energy that escapes from the Sun.RESPONSE OF CLIMATE TO CHANGING SOLAR RADIATIONA number of questions need to be answered if we are to understand the impact of solar changes on the climate system.How sensitive is the Earth's climate to changes in solar radiation?The sensitivity of climate to solar radiation changes, as defined earlier, is not well known. A conservative estimate is that a 0.1 percent change in solar total radiation will bring about a temperature response of 0.06 to 0.2 C, providing the change persists long enough for the climate system to adjust. This could take ten to 100 years.Changes in visible and infrared solar radiation alter the surface temperature by simple heating; other parts of the spectrum can also affect climate, through paths that are less direct. We know, for example, that the enhanced UV radiation that pours outward from the Sun at times of high solar activity increases the amount of ozone in the stratosphere. At times of minima in the eleven-year cycle, less ozone is found. One consequence of these solar perturbations is to complicate the detection of human-induced depletion of the protective ozone layer; another may be to perturb the temperature at the Earth's surface, through connections that link the upper and lower parts of the atmosphere.How does solar forcing compare to that from other sources?The most likely cause of climate change in the period since about 1850, based on estimated magnitudes of known perturbations (Fig. 4), is the growing concentration of greenhouse gases: in particular carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and the commercially-made compounds of chlorine, fluorine, and carbon called halocarbons. Other causes, including solar radiative output variations, are thought to be less important, but they are also far less certain. Most poorly known is the magnitude of the potentially-large cooling effect of atmospheric aerosols.A comparison of significant climate perturbations for the period from 1850 through 1990 is shown in Fig. 4, in terms of the estimated energy that each has added to or subtracted from a stable climate system. Some, like the increasing radiation from the Sun, have added energy; others, like atmospheric aerosols or stratospheric ozone, have taken it away. The net result is an addition of 1.2 watts per square meter. The Sun accounts for about a quarter of the net amount, even though it contributes but 10 percent of the total on the positive, warming side of the balance sheet. Most of the change is attributed to the push and pull of the other, much larger perturbations--which are predominantly of human origin.If we assume that the climate is equally sensitive to radiative forcing from each of these causes, the net increase of 1.2 watts should have brought about an increase in global mean temperature of 0.3 to 1.1 C, depending on the climate sensitivity that is assumed. The documented rise of about 0.5 C in the same period falls at the low end of this range. It may be premature to make such a comparison, however, since it is uncertain when all of the warming would be felt, given the lag times of up to a century that are imposed on the climate system by the thermal inertia of the oceans.What can we learn from climate changes in the pre-industrial era?What is known of climate change prior to the Industrial Revolution affords additional insight. The well-documented surface temperature rise since 1850 can be viewed as but the most recent 60 percent of a warming of about 0.8 C since the 17th century (Fig. 3d), interrupted periodically by volcanic effects. Estimates of Northern hemisphere surface temperatures from 1610 to 1800--during part of the so-called Little Ice Age--correlate well with a reconstruction of changes in solar total radiation--around the time of the Maunder Minimum (Fig. 2c). This suggests, without proving, a predominant solar influence on climate throughout this 200 year, pre-industrial epoch. The reconstructions of solar radiation and surface temperature shown for these years in Figures 3a and 3d tell of an increase in solar radiation of 0.14 percent and a coincident warming of 0.28 C. If we apply the same implied sensitivity to the period since 1850, the 0.13 percent increase in solar radiation in the last 140 years should have produced a warming of 0.26 C, or about half of that observed. If we apply the same relationship to the last 25 years, solar changes can account for less than a third of the warming observed (Fig. 5).In summary, extending the relationship between surface warming and solar change from the Maunder Minimum to the present era implies that while the Sun could account for almost all of the temperature change from 1600 to 1800, it can explain at most a half of the warming from 1600 to the present. When effects of dust from known volcanic eruptions in the early 19th century are also included, solar and volcanic effects can satisfactorily explain much that is known of climate change from 1600 to beginning of the industrial epoch, around 1850.How might solar variations affect projections of global greenhouse warming?What has happened in the past can help us assess the relative importance of solar and anthropogenic changes in the climate of the future.It seems likely that changes in solar radiation, linked to long-term variations in solar activity, may have been the dominant climate driver in the period between about AD 1600 and 1850. As discussed earlier, the explanation of trends in global surface temperature since that time is not as simple, when both the positive and negative impacts of fossil fuel consumption are added to the picture.Since 1850, variations in global surface temperature appear to track changes in the level of solar activity at least as well as they track increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. At the same time, when probable energy inputs are taken into account (as in Fig. 4), solar effects can account for only a fourth of the net change in climate forcing in this 140 year period. It could be that the climate system is more sensitive than we think to changes in solar energy, as opposed to greenhouse gas increases. There could also be errors in our estimates of the magnitudes of other climate forcing terms-- especially aerosol cooling--or, as mentioned earlier, time lags in how the climate system responds.On the basis of what we now know, solar changes might account for a rise of about 0.5 C since the 17th century, perhaps half of the warming since 1850, and less than a third of the warming in the last twenty- five years. The possibility of solar-induced changes of these magnitudes complicates the unambiguous detection of a possible greenhouse warming signal in climate records of the last 100 years or so. We need remember, however, that to ascribe any significant fraction of the documented warming since 1850 to the Sun requires high estimates of climate sensitivity. It also requires the added assumption that long-term changes in solar total radiation can exceed by two and a half times what has been observed in recent measurements from space.Looking ahead, were solar changes limited to what has been measured in the last fifteen years, future changes in the Sun's total radiation would have only a negligible effect on the temperature increases of 1 to 3 C that are now projected in IPCC models for the end of the next century. If greater changes in solar radiation occur--as seems probable based on what is known of climate and solar activity in the past--the Sun needs to be considered in long-term climate projections. The present high levels of solar activity may be approaching all that the Sun can deliver, in terms of total radiation. But, were the Sun's activity and total radiation to drop in the coming century to levels of the Maunder Minimum, solar effects might reduce the expected surface temperature effects of enhanced greenhouse warming--by at most about 0.5 C.Does the Sun affect climate on time scales of 11 years or less?Assessments of climate change that consider possible effects of the Sun presently focus on multi-decadal and centennial time scales, assuming that the Schwabe radiation cycle is too short and its amplitude too small to have any significant effect on the climate system. Yet an assortment of recent and historical data, including those from ice-cores, corals, and the instrumental weather record, do reveal climatic variations with periods of about eleven years.Since the observed Schwabe cycle variations are small, eleven-year periods frequently found in climate data are often ascribed instead to hypothesized oscillations in the atmosphere or oceans, internal to the climate system. A possible solar connection is also often discounted on the basis that climatic events of ten to twelve years duration are neither globally distributed nor always in phase with the ups and downs of the solar cycle. Numerical simulations of the surface-temperature response to a reduction of 0.25 percent in solar total radiation caution against these simplified assumptions. They indicate that some regions of the Earth's surface may cool, and others warm, by amplitudes larger than the net global response, as a result of differences in solar heating of land and ocean surfaces.More subtle solar influences may also be occurring. An apparent correlation between weather patterns and the phase of the Schwabe cycle has been found when the direction of winds in the tropical lower stratosphere is taken into account. These systematic winds oscillate from easterly to westerly with a period slightly greater than two years. Model simulations using solar-cycle forcing slightly larger than was seen during the last decade suggest that the associated solar UV radiation variations could be modifying the Earth's weather by altering the wind and temperature patterns in the stratosphere, both directly and through their effect on ozone concentrations.Are the Ice Ages linked to changes in solar radiation?Solar radiation received at the Earth can vary by means that are unrelated to any changes on the Sun itself. The best studied of these are very long-term changes in the Earth's orbit around the Sun, which alter the distribution of sunlight both geographically and seasonally. They are now believed to trigger the coming and going of the major Ice Ages. As such, they may provide a powerful demonstration of the impacts of changes in solar radiation on the climate system.The changes involved arise from gradual shifts in the shape and orientation of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, and in the present 23 1/2  tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation. These cyclic changes, brought about by the changing gravitational pull of the other planets and the Moon, introduce periods of about 19, 23, 41, and 100 thousand years in the distribution of sunlight over the globe. The total annual dosage, averaged over the entire surface, varies by up to 0.1 percent, while more specific, seasonal changes at any place can reach a few percent. Such changes are apparently sufficient to trigger major changes in climate--implying that the Earth's climate system may be more sensitive to small solar radiative perturbations than one might think.Climate simulations are as yet unable to account for the unexpectedly prominent 100 thousand year periodicity in the record of past climate. This long period is associated with the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit, which oscillates between circular and slightly elliptical. Accompanying changes in the Sun-Earth distance directly affect the amount of solar radiation incident in on the Earth in different parts of the year. Changes in activity on the Sun itself could exert a similar effect.CONCLUSIONSThat the Sun plays a critical part in the Earth's climate system is indisputable; moreover, both the Sun and the climate change continually, over all time scales. Yet the physical connections that might link the variations seen on one with the variability presently occurring in the other are but poorly known. One and a half decades of continuous monitoring of direct solar radiation have provided long-needed information, but this short period of time is but a wink of an eye in the life of the Sun, and a woefully inadequate sample of the full range of its possible behavior.We now know--thanks to recent spaceborne monitoring--that sunlight received at the Earth follows the drum beat of the eleven-year sunspot cycle, with both the total and short wavelength emissions varying in phase with solar activity. At the peaks of recent eleven-year cycles the total energy from the Sun increased by about 0.1 percent, and the UV portion by several percent or more. In years of the cycle when sunspots are few--as is presently the case--both total and UV radiation are diminished.We also know from isotopic archives of solar activity that the Sun exhibits greater variability on time scales that exceed the eleven-year cycle. Detecting and confirming larger-amplitude, longer-period cycles in solar radiation--if they indeed exist--will require reliable continuous solar monitoring, well into the next century. NASA's Office of Mission to Planet Earth and the European Space Agency are presently conducting these measurements on, respectively, the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and the Solar Heliospheric Observatory. Future solar radiation monitoring is planned for NASA's Earth Observing System and the NOAA/DoD National Polar- Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, although in the latter case not at UV wavelengths. Redundancy afforded by multiple space-based instruments is critical for separating solar and instrumental effects in these difficult radiometric measurements, and to ensure overlap so that the long- term database is not broken. Supporting observations from the ground are also necessary in order to interpret the causes of measured variations. Present lack of access to space, the overall low priority of solar influences in global change research, and continued reductions of Earth environmental monitoring threaten the accomplishment of this task.Climate model simulations indicate that changes in solar radiation a few times larger than those confirmed in the eleven-year cycle, and persisting over multi-decadal time scales, would directly affect the surface temperature. Since such models cannot account for the climate system's apparent sensitivity to small perturbations in solar energy apparently brought about by the very long term changes in the Earth's orbit about the Sun, they may also underestimate climate sensitivity to energy output fluctuations caused by solar activity, even during the eleven-year Schwabe cycle. Nor do these simulations yet include potential effects of changes in the solar spectrum, including the more variable UV.The unsolved puzzle of how subtle variations driven by Earth-orbit changes can affect the climate suggests a closer look at feedback processes, including other pathways than direct solar radiative forcing. These should include known changes in solar energy inputs across the entire spectrum and possible connections that might amplify small changes in radiation, not only at the Earth's surface but from the top to the bottom of the atmosphere. Such studies of solar perturbations can serve the broader cause as diagnostic probes of the atmosphere and climate system.Ambiguities regarding projected greenhouse warming call in much the same way for clearer information regarding the role of the Sun, as a possibly important contributor to the current warming trend. Climate simulations using only greenhouse gas changes predict a warming that exceeds the 0.5 C that is documented in the instrumental record of the past 140 years. To reconcile the difference between the observed and the predicted values, either the models are wrong or other, natural and anthropogenic forcings must be properly factored in.If variations in the output of the Sun are indeed limited to the tenth of a percent that is recorded in direct measurements, future solar changes will likely have but a small effect, one way or the other, on the surface warming of a few degrees that is expected to result from doubled concentrations of greenhouse gases. If we include reasoned deductions from what we know of the Sun and climate in the past, we must allow that solar changes could potentially alter the anticipated effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases on the surface temperature of the Earth.In this case the Sun could make a difference of about 0.5 C in the surface temperatures now projected by consensus climate models for doubled concentrations of CO2. A fortuitous future cooling of this amount, due to the Sun, would not fully compensate for the effects of increases in greenhouse gases, which are projected to warm the Earth by 1 to 3 . Furthermore, the overall, long-term level of solar activity would have to fall steadily and systematically over the next few hundred years from the current, high sunspot numbers that have characterized the greater part of the 20th century. Were that to happen, the principal impacts would be to cloud for a time the unambiguous detection of enhanced greenhouse warming and to soften, by at most about a half, its projected impact on the temperature of the planet. The rapid warming since 1970 is several times larger than that expected from any known or suspected effects of the Sun, and may already indicate the growing influence of atmospheric greenhouse gases on the Earth's climate.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://ess.geology.ufl.edu/ess/Notes/040-Sun/primer.html<TEXT>We all know that the Sun is overwhelmingly important to life on Earth, but few of us have been given a good description of our star and its variations.The Sun is an average star, similar to millions of others in the Universe. It is a prodigious energy machine, manufacturing about 3.8 x 1023 kiloWatts (or kiloJoules/sec). In other words, if the total output of the Sun was gathered for one second it would provide the U.S. with enough energy, at its current usage rate, for the next 9,000,000 years. The basic energy source for the Sun is nuclear fusion, which uses the high temperatures and densities within the core to fuse hydrogen, producing energy and creating helium as a byproduct. The core is so dense and the size of the Sun so great that energy released at the center of the Sun takes about 50,000,000 years to make its way to the surface, undergoing countless absorptions and re-emissions in the process. If the Sun were to stop producing energy today, it would take 50,000,000 years for significant effects to be felt at Earth!The Sun has been producing its radiant and thermal energies for the past four or five billion years. It has enough hydrogen to continue producing for another hundred billion years. However, in about ten to twenty billion years the surface of the Sun will begin to expand, enveloping the inner planets (including Earth). At that time, our Sun will be known as a red giant star. If the Sun were more massive, it would collapse and re-ignite as a helium-burning star. Due to its average size, however, the Sun is expected to merely contract into a relatively small, cool star known as a white dwarf.It has long been known that the Sun is neither featureless nor steady. (Theophrastus first identified sunspots in the year 325 B.C.) Some of the more important solar features are explained in the following sections.SunspotsWhite Light Image of Sun (MPEG movie 24 kbytes, 38 frames, 300x300 pixels)Sunspots, dark areas on the solar surface, contain transient, concentrated magnetic fields. They are the most prominent visible features on the Sun; a moderate-sized sunspot is about as large as Earth. Sunspots form and dissipate over periods of days or weeks. They occur when strong magnetic fields emerge through the solar surface and allow the area to cool slightly, from a background value of 6000 degrees C down to about 4200 degrees C; this area appears as a dark spot in contrast with the Sun. The darkest area at the center of a sunspot is called the umbra; it is here that the magnetic field strengths are the highest. The less-dark, striated area around the umbra is called the penumbra. Sunspots rotate with the solar surface, taking about 27 days to make a complete rotation as seen from Earth. Sunspots near the Sun's equator rotate at a faster rate than those near the solar poles. Groups of sunspots, especially those with complex magnetic field configurations, are often the sites of flares.Over the last 300 years, the average number of sunspots has regularly waxed and waned in an 11-year sunspot cycle. The Sun, like Earth, has its seasons but its year equals 11 of ours.Coronal HolesCoronal holes are variable solar features that can last for months to years. They are seen as large, dark holes when the Sun is viewed in x-ray wavelengths. These holes are rooted in large cells of unipolar magnetic fields on the Sun's surface; their field lines extend far out into the solar system. These open field lines allow a continuous outflow of high-velocity solar wind. Coronal holes have a long-term cycle, but it doesn't correspond exactly to the sunspot cycle; they holes tend to be most numerous in the years following sunspot maximum. At some stages of the solar cycle, these holes are continuously visible at the solar north and south poles.ProminencesSolar prominences (seen as dark filaments on the disk) are usually quiescent clouds of solar material held above the solar surface by magnetic fields. Most prominences erupt at some point in their lifetime, releasing large amounts of solar material into space.FlaresSolar flares are intense, temporary releases of energy. They are seen at ground-based observatories as bright areas on the Sun in optical wavelengths and as bursts of noise at radio wavelengths; they can last from minutes to hours. Flares are our solar system's largest explosive events which can be equivalent to approximately 40 billion Hiroshima-size atomic bombs. The primary energy source for flares appears to be the tearing and reconnection of strong magnetic fields. They radiate throughout the electromagnetic spectrum, from gamma rays to x-rays, through visible light out to kilometer-long radio waves.Coronal Mass EjectionsThe outer solar atmosphere, the corona, is structured by strong magnetic fields. Where these fields are closed, often above sunspot groups, the confined solar atmosphere can suddenly and violently release bubbles or tongues of gas and magnetic fields called coronal mass ejections. A large CME can contain 10.0E16 grams (a billion tons) of matter that can be accelerated to several million miles per hour in a spectacular explosion. Solar material streaks out through the interplanetary medium, impacting any planets or spacecraft in its path. CMEs are sometimes associated with flares but usually occur independently.Between Sun and EarthThe region between the Sun and the planets has been termed the interplanetary medium. Although once considered a perfect vacuum, this is actually a turbulent region dominated by the solar wind, which flows at velocities of approximately 250-1000 km/s (about 600,000 to 2,000,000 miles per hour). Other characteristics of the solar wind (density, composition, and magnetic field strength, among others) vary with changing conditions on the Sun. The effect of the solar wind can be seen in the tails of comets which always point away from the Sun.The solar wind flows around obstacles such as planets, but those planets with their own magnetic fields respond in specific ways. Earth's magnetic field is very similar to the pattern formed when iron filings align around a bar magnet. Under the influence of the solar wind, these magnetic field lines are compressed in the Sunward direction and stretched out in the downwind direction. This creates the magnetosphere, a complex, teardrop-shaped cavity around Earth. The Van Allen radiation belts are within this cavity, as is the ionosphere, a layer of Earth's upper atmosphere where photo ionization by solar x-rays and extreme ultraviolet rays creates free electrons. Earth's magnetic field senses the solar wind its speed, density, and magnetic field. Because the solar wind varies over time scales as short as seconds, the interface that separates interplanetary space from the magnetosphere is very dynamic. Normally this interface called the magnetopause lies at a distance equivalent to about 10 Earth radii in the direction of the Sun. However, during episodes of elevated solar wind density or velocity, the magnetopause can be pushed inward to within 6.6 Earth radii (the altitude of geosynchronous satellites). As the magnetosphere extracts energy from the solar wind, internal processes produce geomagnetic storms.Solar Effects at EarthSome major terrestrial results of solar variations are the aurora, proton events, and geomagnetic storms.AuroraThe aurora is a dynamic and visually delicate manifestation of solar-induced geomagnetic storms. The solar wind energizes electrons and ions in the magnetosphere. These particles usually enter Earth's upper atmosphere near the polar regions. When the particles strike the molecules and atoms of the thin, high atmosphere, some of them start to glow in different colors.Aurorae begin between 60 and 80 degrees latitude. As a storm intensifies, the aurorae spread toward the equator. During an unusually large storm in 1909, an aurora was visible at Singapore, on the geomagnetic equator. The aurorae provide pretty displays, but they are just a visible sign of atmospheric changes that may wreak havoc on technological systems.Proton EventsEnergetic protons can reach Earth within 30 minutes of a major flare's peak. During such an event, Earth is showered energetic solar particles (primarily protons) released from the flare site. Some of these particles spiral down Earth's magnetic field lines, penetrating the upper layers of our atmosphere where they produce additional ionization and may produce a significant increase in the radiation environment.Geomagnetic StormsOne to four days after a flare or eruptive prominence occurs, a slower cloud of solar material and magnetic fields reaches Earth, buffeting the magnetosphere and resulting in a geomagnetic storm. These storms are extraordinary variations in Earth's surface magnetic field. During a geomagnetic storm, portions of the solar wind's energy is transferred to the magnetosphere, causing Earth's magnetic field to change rapidly in direction and intensity and energize the particle populations within it.Disrupted SystemsCommunications    Many communication systems utilize the ionosphere to reflect radio signals over long distances. Ionospheric storms can affect radio communication at all latitudes. Some radio frequencies are absorbed and others are reflected, leading to rapidly fluctuating signals and unexpected propagation paths. TV and commercial radio stations are little affected by solar activity, but ground-to-air, ship-to-shore, Voice of America, Radio Free Europe, and amateur radio are frequently disrupted. Radio operators using high frequencies rely upon solar and geomagnetic alerts to keep their communication circuits up and running.    Some military detection or early-warning systems are also affected by solar activity. The Over-the-Horizon Radar bounces signals off the ionosphere in order to monitor the launch of aircraft and missiles from long distances. During geomagnetic storms, this system can be severely hampered by radio clutter. Some submarine detection systems use the magnetic signatures of submarines as one input to their locating schemes. Geomagnetic storms can mask and distort these signals.    The Federal Aviation Administration routinely receives alerts of solar radio bursts so that they can recognize communication problems and forego unnecessary maintenance. When an aircraft and a ground station are aligned with the Sun, jamming of air-control radio frequencies can occur. This can also happen when an Earth station, a satellite, and the Sun are in alignment.Navigation Systems    Navigation Image    Systems such as LORAN and OMEGA are adversely affected when solar activity disrupts their signal propagation. The OMEGA system consists of eight transmitters located through out the world. Airplanes and ships use the very low frequency signals from these transmitters to determine their positions. During solar events and geomagnetic storms, the system can give navigators information that is inaccurate by as much as several miles. If navigators are alerted that a proton event or geomagnetic storm is in progress, they can switch to a backup system. GPS signals are affected when solar activity causes sudden variations in the density of the ionosphere.Satellites    Satellite Image    Geomagnetic storms and increased solar ultraviolet emission heat Earth's upper atmosphere, causing it to expand. The heated air rises, and the density at the orbit of satellites up to about 1000 km increases significantly. This results in increased drag on satellites in space, causing them to slow and change orbit slightly. Unless low-Earth-orbit satellites are routinely boosted to higher orbits, they slowly fall, and eventually burn up in Earth's atmosphere.    Skylab is an example of a spacecraft re-entering Earth's atmosphere prematurely as a result of higher-than-expected solar activity. During the great geomagnetic storm of March 1989, four of the Navy's navigational satellites had to be taken out of service for up to a week.    As technology has allowed spacecraft components to become smaller, their miniaturized systems have become increasingly vulnerable to the more energetic solar particles. These particles can cause physical damage to microchips and can change software commands in satellite- borne computers.    Differential Charging. Another problem for satellite operators is differential charging. During geomagnetic storms, the number and energy of electrons and ions increase. When a satellite travels through this energized environment, the charged particles striking the spacecraft cause different portions of the spacecraft to be differentially charged. Eventually, electrical discharges can arc across spacecraft components, harming and possibly disabling them. Bulk Charging. Bulk charging (also called deep charging) occurs when energetic particles, primarily electrons, penetrate the outer covering of a satellite and deposit their charge in its internal parts. If sufficient charge accumulates in any one component, it may attempt to neutralize by discharging to other components. This discharge is potentially hazardous to the satellite's electronic systems.Radiation Hazards to Humans    Radiation Hazard Image    Intense solar flares release very-high-energy particles that can be as injurious to humans as the low-energy radiation from nuclear blasts. Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere allow adequate protection for us on the ground, but astronauts in space are subject to potentially lethal dosages of radiation. The penetration of high-energy particles into living cells, measured as radiation dose, leads to chromosome damage and, potentially, cancer. Large doses can be fatal immediately. Solar protons with energies greater than 30 MeV are particularly hazardous. In October 1989, the Sun produced enough energetic particles that an astronaut on the Moon, wearing only a space suit and caught out in the brunt of the storm, would probably have died. (Astronauts who had time to gain safety in a shelter beneath moon soil would have absorbed only slight amounts of radiation.)    Solar proton events can also produce elevated radiation aboard aircraft flying at high altitudes. Although these risks are small, monitoring of solar proton events by satellite instrumentation allows the occassional exposure to be monitored and evaluated.Geologic Exploration    Earth's magnetic field is used by geologists to determine subterranean rock structures. For the most part, these geodetic surveyors are searching for oil, gas, or mineral deposits. They can accomplish this only when Earth's field is quiet, so that true magnetic signatures can be detected. Other surveyors prefer to work during geomagnetic storms, when the variations to Earth's normal subsurface electric currents help them to see subsurface oil or mineral structures. For these reasons, many surveyors use geomagnetic alerts and predictions to schedule their mapping activities.Electric Power    Electric Power Lines    When magnetic fields move about in the vicinity of a conductor such as a wire, an electric current is induced into the conductor. This happens on a grand scale during geomagnetic storms. Power companies transmit alternating current to their customers via long transmission lines. The nearly direct currents induced in these lines from geomagnetic storms are harmful to electrical transmission equipment. On March 13, 1989, in Montreal, Quebec, 6 million people were without commercial electric power for 9 hours as a result of a huge geomagnetic storm. Some areas in the northeastern U.S. and in Sweden also lost power. By receiving geomagnetic storm alerts and warnings, power companies can minimize damage and power outages.Pipelines    Pipeline Image    Rapidly fluctuating geomagnetic fields can induce currents into pipelines. During these times, several problems can arise for pipeline engineers. Flow meters in the pipeline can transmit erroneous flow information, and the corrosion rate of the pipeline is dramatically increased. If engineers unwittingly attempt to balance the current during a geomagnetic storm, corrosion rates may increase even more. Pipeline managers routinely receive alerts and warnings to help them provide an efficient and long-lived system.Climate    The Sun is the heat engine that drives the circulation of our atmosphere. Although it has long been assumed to be a constant source of energy, recent measurements of this solar constant have shown that the base output of the Sun can vary by up to two tenths of a percent over the 11-year solar cycle. Temporary decreases of up to one-half percent have been observed. Atmospheric scientists say that this variation is significant and that it can modify climate over time. Plant growth has been shown to vary over the 11-year sunspot and 22-year magnetic cycles of the Sun, as evidenced in tree-ring records.    While the solar cycle has been nearly regular during the last 300 years, there was a period of 70 years during the 17th and 18th centuries when very few sunspots were seen (even though telescopes were widely used). This drop in sunspot number coincided with the timing of the little ice age in Europe, implying a Sun- to-climate connection. Recently, a more direct link between climate and solar variability has been speculated. Stratospheric winds near the equator blow in different directions, depending on the time in the solar cycle. Studies are under way to determine how this wind reversal affects global circulation patterns and weather.    During proton events, many more energetic particles reach Earth's middle atmosphere. There they cause molecular ionization, creating chemicals that destroy atmospheric ozone and allow increased amounts of harmful solar ultraviolet radiation to reach Earth's surface. A solar proton event in 1982 resulted in a temporary 70% decrease in ozone densities.Biology    There is a growing body of evidence that changes in the geomagnetic field affect biological systems. Studies indicate that physically stressed human biological systems may respond to fluctuations in the geomagnetic field. Interest and concern in this subject have led the Union of Radio Science International to create a new commission entitled Electromagnetics in Biology and Medicine.    Possibly the most closely studied of the variable Sun's biological effects has been the degradation of homing pigeons' navigational abilities during geomagnetic storms. Pigeons and other migratory animals, such as dolphins and whales, have internal biological compasses composed of the mineral magnetite wrapped in bundles of nerve cells. While this probably is not their primarily method of navigation, there have been many pigeon race smashes, a term used when only a small percentage of birds return home from a release site. Because these losses have occurred during geomagnetic storms, pigeon handlers have learned to ask for geomagnetic alerts and warnings as an aid to scheduling races. ConclusionIt has been realized and appreciated only in the last few decades that solar flares, CMEs, and magnetic storms affect people and their activities. The list of consequences grows in proportion to our dependence on technological systems. The subtleties of the interactions between Sun and Earth, and between solar particles and delicate instruments, have become factors that affect our well being. Thus there will be continued and intensified need for space environment services to address health, safety, and commercial needs.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://library.thinkquest.org/5579/weather/aaron.htm<TEXT>The weather on Mars is very severe and very different from the Earth's weather in many ways. On Mars, temperatures can range from -225 F in fall and winter to 65 F in spring and summer. The extremely cold temperatures would surely make you freeze to death. There is a possibility of temperatures rising to as high as 72 F to 74 F, but because Mars has no ozone layer your skin would be brutally burnt from the effects of solar radiation.Violent storms occur on Mars. Photos from the Mars Global Surveyor show that the planet of Mars experiences some heavy and dangerous flooding. These floods are caused by long term rainfall which is so heavy that storm clouds virtually cover half of the Red Planet. In addition, these floods are so destructive that they have been recorded to burst dammed up craters with waters traveling at more than 100 m.p.h. Michael C. Malin, a research scientist on the Mars Observer Team, had analyzed one of these violent floods. He stated that "the water flow was 1,000 times greater than floods that have struck the U.S. Midwest in recent years."On Mars there have also been major dust storms. These storms were clocked at speeds of 350 m.p.h. These dust storms are so forceful that they would surely destroy anything in their paths.Like Earth, Mars has four distinct seasons, but Mars' seasons are very long in comparison to Earth's. The reason for this is that Mars' orbit around the sun compared to earth is elliptical, and Mars is farther away from the sun.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://library.thinkquest.org/C003124/en/sunmoon.htm<TEXT>The Sun and the Moon both have their influences on the earth. Sometimes they cooperate and sometimes they counteract each other. Such influences are: gravity, the heat of the sun, sunlight and our chronology.Chronology:The earth rotates with a speed of 65,000 mph(105,000 kph) in an elliptic (oval) orbit around the sun. One rotation around the sun takes 365,42 days. The Western calendar year is 365 days long. Therefore every four years the Western calendar adds an extra day (a leap year) to compensate this. This happens at February 29. In one orbit around the sun the earth 'travels' 584,018,150 miles (939,886,400 km). The distance from the earth to the sun is at the closest point 91,402,300 miles (147,097,800 km) on January 3. The distance at the farthest point is 94,509,400 miles (152,098,200 km) on July 4.The moon rotates around the earth in 273,3 days. But because the earth also spins, there are 29,53 days between two Full Moons. It is Full Moon when we see all of its bright side lighted by the sun. When the moon is completely dark, it is New Moon. The classification in months is based on the time it takes for the moon to go through all its four phases. The earth also rotates around its own axis. In 24 hours the earth spins around its axis from west to east. One spin of the earth around its own axis is a day. Different places on the earth's surface move at different speeds. Places near the Poles barely move at all, while those on the equator (a line midway between the Poles) zoom around at more than 1,000 mph(1,600 kph).Light:Because the earth rotates in 24 hours from west to east, you see the sun rising everyday in the east and sinking in the west. The earth's axis is not quite at right angles to the sun, but tilts over at an angle of 23,5? , this is the angle of inclination. Through the tilt of the earth's axis, daylight varies throughout the year. It varies the least at the equator and the most at the Poles. Therefore, it is never completely dark at the Poles in summer nor is it is ever completely light in winter.The cycle of New Moon to Full Moon and back causes that at night a part of the sunlight gets reflected by the moon to the earth's surface. Because of this it gets less dark.The Heat of the Sun:Besides light, the sun also produces heat waves. From the total radiation of heat of the sun, 47 percent reaches the earth's surface. The other 53 percent gets absorbed or reflected in different ways: 23 percent gets reflected by clouds, 16 percent gets absorbed by steam, dust and gases in the air, 7 percent gets diffused and spread by the atmosphere, 4 percent gets reflected by land and oceans and 3 percent gets absorbed by clouds.The fate of solar radiationOnly 47 percent of solarradiation reaches the ground.The remaining 53 percent is absorbed or reflected in various ways on its way down.Seasonal changeIt is the Earth's tilted axis that produces seasonalweather and gives us days of different length. If theEarth was at right angles to the Sun, day and nightwould always be equal length, and there would only be one season throughout the whole year.          Because the earth's axis is not quite at right angles to the sun, the four seasons exist: spring, summer, autumn and winter. In summer the sun shines longer and is high in the sky and the sunrays shine more directly at the earth's surface. That's why the weather is warmer then. In winter it is just the opposite. The sun shines shorter and the sunrays reach the earth's surface at a wider angle, which causes temperatures to drop.Gravity:Gravity causes the earth to move around the sun. It is an invisible force that is still not completely understood by science. This phenomenon not only causes the earth to keep moving around the sun, but also to keep the moon rotating around the earth and it makes things fall to the ground. All matter, even the smallest object, has a gravitational force. The heavier the object, the stronger its gravitational force.The sun is far away but it's very heavy and has a big gravitational force with respect to the earth. Because of the speed, the earth has the tendency to fly away from the sun. The gravity of the sun stops this, so that the earth stays in its orbit. This also happens when you swing around an object on a rope. You feel the power by which you keep the item in its orbit as long as you keep swinging the rope. When you let it go, the item shoots outwards.How tides are formedRoughly every 12 hours, the oceans on each side of the globe rise a littleand then fall back. These tides are caused by the varying gravitational pull between the spinning Earth and the Moon and the Sun.          The earth is also a big and heavy 'object' and also has a big gravity. This is why we keep staying on the ground and that everything you let go, falls to the ground. The moon spins around the earth and keeps moving by the attraction of the earth in the same way as the earth keeps moving around the sun. But the moon also has its attraction to the earth. We can see this every day on the beach when we witness the movements of high tide and low tide. Because the sun and the moon exert their gravitational influences on the earth, the earth gets stretched into a slight oval. The solid part of the earth (the crust) is difficult to stretch. With the water in the oceans it gets easier, because it's fluid. By this the oceans rise and fall at both sides of the earth and you get high tide and low tide. When the sun, the earth and the moon line up, these forces get stronger and you get spring tide (especially high tide). When the sun is at right angles with the moon, then these forces counteract and you have neap tides (especially low tide). </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.esa.int/esaCP/ESAN3D0VMOC_index_0.html<TEXT>Surfing and diving in the Earth's magnetosphere, Cluster celebrates one year of science excellence in orbitSpace scientists around the world are today celebrating the first anniversary of the European Space Agency's revolutionary Cluster mission to explore near-Earth space and study the interaction between the Sun and Earth.This groundbreaking mission began exactly one year ago, on 16 July 2000, when two of the four Cluster spacecraft were launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Within a month, a second pair of identical satellites joined them in similar orbits that pass over the Earth's poles.After the most complex period of spacecraft commissioning ever undertaken for any space mission - including the verification and testing of 44 separate instruments and 64 boom deployment sequences - full scientific operations started on 1 February 2001.Since then, the Cluster quartet has been carrying out the most comprehensive exploration of the Earth's environment ever undertaken. For the first time, scientists have been able to explore the magnetosphere - the magnetic bubble that surrounds the Earth - with a flotilla of four identical spacecraft."Although Cluster has only been fully operational for five months, we have already gathered a huge amount of new information about the Sun - Earth connection," said Professor David Southwood, ESA Director of Science. "More than 200 scientists around the world are currently analysing this remarkable treasure trove of data.""It has been a very challenging, but satisfying year," said Philippe Escoubet, Cluster project scientist. "Cluster is a completely new type of scientific mission, so it took us a while to find out how to get the best out of the satellites and their suite of instruments. Now we are receiving exciting new information about the magnetosphere and making new discoveries all the time."By flying in a close, tetrahedral (lop-sided pyramid) formation, the four spacecraft have provided scientists with their first small-scale, three-dimensional views of near-Earth space."Cluster's new three-dimensional 'picture' of the magnetosphere is rather like looking at photos of an old familiar scene, but instead of the dull black-and-white pictures, we now have the same view in brilliant colours," said Professor Andre Balogh of Imperial College, London, principal investigator for the FGM experiment on Cluster.Monitoring the magnetic shield around Spaceship EarthLike a spacecraft orbiting another world, our Earth is trapped on an everlasting journey around the Sun. During its eternal voyage, Spaceship Earth is continuously exposed to the solar wind, a perpetual blast of plasma (electrically charged particles) sweeping outwards from our nearest star.Fortunately for us, the Earth is protected by a powerful magnetic field which forces the supersonic solar wind to sweep around the planet. In the process, the magnetic field is shaped into a gigantic teardrop that typically extends approximately 65 000 km towards the Sun and more than two million km - five times the distance to the Moon - in the opposite direction.However, a continuous struggle for supremacy rages as gusts in the solar wind cause the magnetosphere to balloon in and out. The fluctuating fortunes of the magnetic field are monitored by the Cluster flotilla as it flies through different regions of this unpredictable teardrop - the bow shock, the magnetopause, the cusps and the tail.On the sunward side of the Earth lies the bow shock, where particles of the solar wind slam into the magnetosphere at a speed of about 400 km/s (around 1.5 million km per hour). This creates an enormous shock wave similar to a sonic boom ahead of a supersonic aircraft.The new three-dimensional view from Cluster reveals a fast-moving, complex surface, in contrast to the motionless snapshots, frozen in time, provided by previous spacecraft measurements. During their encounters with the bow shock, the Cluster satellites have found that this turbulent boundary moves through space at 5 to 6 km/s (about the same speed that the International Space Station travels around the Earth).Cluster has also provided the first confirmation of waves along the magnetopause - the outer limit of Earth's magnetic field. Until now, these plasma waves have only existed in computer simulations, but the Cluster spacecraft have surfed these waves and confirmed their existence. The speed of the waves has been estimated at around 70 km/s - equivalent to travelling from London to Paris in 4.5 seconds.One of the real surprises concerned the polar cusps - 'windows' above the northern and southern polar regions where the particles from the solar wind can penetrate the magnetic shield. These cusps rapidly shift position due to gusts in the solar wind. The Cluster quartet has shown that they pivot through space at between 10 and 30 km/s - the first time this motion has been directly measured by spacecraft.Closer to Earth, the mini-armada has flown through the plasmasphere - a doughnut-shaped region of dense plasma, mostly electrons and protons, that lies between the Earth's two magnetic poles. By flying in formation through the narrow part of the doughnut, Cluster has provided the best data yet on its complex ingredients of particles, electric and magnetic fields.Radio signals from lightning, auroras (the curtains of red and green light that illuminate the polar skies) and particles that are trapped in the Earth's radiation belts have also been detected by Cluster. The new data are enabling scientists to find out where these signals originate and how they travel through near-Earth space.Most dramatic of all have been the Cluster observations of solar storms. With the Sun now at maximum activity in its 11 year cycle, numerous powerful sunstorms are expected to occur. When one of the biggest solar storms on record began on 8 November 2000, instruments on Cluster were used to monitor the dramatic changes around Spaceship Earth.About 8 minutes after a huge cloud of hot gas, known as a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), was blasted from the Sun, the WHISPER instrument on Cluster detected an intense radio emission. Several days later, when the CME arrived at the Earth, it punched into the magnetosphere, pushing the magnetic shield toward the planet and leaving the Cluster spacecraft exposed to the solar wind, where they stayed for many hours.The best is yet to come...The latest chapter in Cluster's exciting exploration began in June, when ESA's intrepid flotilla began to explore the elongated magnetotail which stretches far beyond the Moon. During the next few months, Cluster will cast new light on this region where storms of high energy particles are generated. When these particles arrive at the Earth, they can cause intense auroras on the nightside of the Earth. A less attractive consequence is their ability to cause power cuts, damage satellites and disrupt communications."Cluster will provide us with a mass of new information about what takes place inside this magnetic 'power station' and help us to find out what generates such surges of energetic particles," said Dr. Escoubet."As we pass Cluster's first launch anniversary, we are all looking forward to even more exciting results in the months ahead," he added. "The best is yet to come."</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20010712cloudcover.html<TEXT>Greater Solar Activity May Bring U.S. More Gray DaysNASA-funded Earth Science researchers have discovered that during periods of increased solar activity much of the United States becomes cloudier, possibly because the jet stream in the troposphere moves northward causing changes to regional climate patterns.The new study supports earlier findings by suggesting there is a relationship between increased cloud cover over the United States and the solar maximum, the most intense stage of activity on the Sun.Previous studies have shown that during the solar maximum, the jet stream in the Northern Hemisphere moves northward. The jet stream guides storms and plays an important role in cloudiness, precipitation and storm formation in the United States.Dr. Petra Udelhofen, a NASA-funded researcher at the Institute for Terrestrial and Planetary Atmospheres at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, is the lead author of a paper that discusses this topic, appearing in the July 1 issue of Geophysical Research Letters."Based on these results and because the location of the jet stream influences cloudiness," said Udelhofen, "we suggest that the jet stream plays an important role in linking solar variability and cloud cover."The jet stream is a ribbon of fast-moving air in the upper troposphere that blows from west to east. Storms beneath the jet stream follow its path. A shift in the jet stream can alter the location of clouds and precipitation across the U.S.The troposphere is the region of the atmosphere that extends from the Earth's surface out to about 50,000 feet and is the focus of local, regional and global weather research. The stratosphere extends above the troposphere to about 150,000 feet and is the region where the ozone layer is formed.The Sun's energy output varies over an 11-year cycle, sending more ultraviolet radiation towards the Earth during times of increased activity. While the Sun's total energy output only varies by about one-tenth of one percent between periods of low and high solar activity, the ultraviolet radiation that affects ozone production in the stratosphere can change by more than 10 percent.Ultraviolet radiation is absorbed in the Earth's stratosphere and creates the protective ozone layer. When the ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation, it warms the stratosphere, which may affect movement of air in the troposphere where clouds form.Solar cycle effects of ultraviolet radiation absorption by ozone in the stratosphere, its impact on atmospheric circulation and the location of storm tracks have been the subject of recent Earth Science research."Our results show that cloudiness varies on average by about two percent between years of solar maximum and minimum. In most parts of the U.S., cloud cover is slightly greater in years of solar maximum," noted Udelhofen.Though more investigation is needed to better understand just how changes in the Sun's ultraviolet energy output is linked to atmospheric winds, the study helps people identify potential large-scale mechanisms that affect local and regional climates.Scientists continue to investigate mechanisms that may link solar variability with weather. These new results support the idea of a link between stratospheric chemistry and meteorology, and support other recent theoretical studies associated with the impact of stratospheric chemistry on climate change and weather."It is important for future studies to identify and explain in detail the link between solar variability, ozone, the atmospheric circulation and cloud cover," Udelhofen said.This research is part of the NASA Earth Science Enterprise program, which is dedicated to understanding how Earth is changing and what consequences these changes have for life on Earth.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/news/0005/fullpr.html<TEXT>Connection of Sun's and Earth's Magnetic Fields Provides Energy for Auroras, Space WeatherSpace physicists have made the first direct observations of the process that causes auroras and magnetic disturbances -- or space weather -- around the Earth. Settling a fifty-year-old debate, scientists have directly measured the transfer of energy from the solar wind into the magnetic space around Earth, or magnetosphere, and down to the atmosphere. Such events can affect radio communications, spacecraft operations, and the control of electric power systems on Earth.Relying on observations collected by NASA's Polar spacecraft and Japan's Geotail spacecraft, scientists associated with the International Solar-Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) program have gathered the first direct evidence that a process known as magnetic reconnection occurs naturally in the Sun-Earth system. Until now, reconnection had only been observed under contrived conditions in a few physics laboratories.During reconnection, magnetic fields that are heading in opposite directions -having opposite north or south polarities -- break and connect to each other. In space, reconnection between the magnetic fields of the Earth and Sun allows the solar wind to break through the planet's magnetic shell and flow into the space around Earth. Along the way, magnetic energy gets converted to bursts of particle energy that create auroras - "northern or southern lights" -- and space weather storms.Indirect evidence of reconnection has provoked debate for more than half a century, as space physicists could only detect signs of reconnection after it had happened. But recently, the Polar spacecraft flew through a region on the sunlit side of Earth where reconnection was in progress, gathering the first eyewitness account of the process. Using data collected from Geotail's dozens of passes through Earth's magnetic tail, scientists also have pinpointed the area on the night side where reconnection occurs, and have shown for the first time a clear association between reconnection and auroras."Reconnection is the fundamental process for transferring and exchanging energy in the Sun-Earth system," said Dr. Atsuhiro Nishida, a researcher with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and the recently retired Director-General of Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS). "Reconnection on the day side of Earth is critical for allowing solar wind energy to come into the magnetosphere. Night-side reconnection is critical for the transfer of that energy down to the atmosphere."Nishida and colleagues presented their results today at the spring meeting of the American Geophysical Union, held in Washington, D.C.While crucial for understanding space weather, the direct observation of reconnection around Earth has implications for many fields of physics. Reconnection on the Sun likely plays a role in the development of solar flares and of coronal mass ejections. Similar magnetic activity outside our solar system may explain some of the galactic X-rays that astronomers have detected. And observations of reconnection in nature may aid the study of nuclear fusion and other plasma processes in the laboratory. The magnetosphere is the only place where reconnection has been observed first-hand as it occurs naturally.A popular misconception holds that auroras and space weather are caused when electrically charged particles from the Sun plunge directly into Earth's atmosphere near the magnetic poles. But in fact, the Sun provides the energy -- but not necessarily the particles -- to drive space weather activity around Earth. And rather than a direct trip from the solar atmosphere to Earth's poles, solar wind and storms from the Sun must pass through these small and elusive reconnection regions before they can stir up space weather."The magnetosphere acts like a great magnetic cocoon around the Earth," said Dr. Jack Scudder, professor of physics at the University of Iowa and principal investigator for the Hot Plasma Analyzer (HYDRA) on NASA's Polar spacecraft. "There are often times when the solar wind creates tears in this cocoon, allowing charged particles and energy from the Sun to enter the space around Earth. This tearing - reconnection - is what we directly observed with Polar."Once these "tears" open up - scientists call them "reconnection regions" - the magnetic field of the solar wind becomes directly linked to the magnetosphere. Solar energy floods into the system, overloading and destabilizing it. The energy excites the particles already trapped around the Earth and stretches the magnetic tail like taut rubber bands, forcing reconnection to happen again -- this time inside Earth's space. As magnetic field lines on the night side snap and reconnect, they shoot energy stored in the tail down toward the auroral zones near the poles and into the radiation belts.When the solar wind and magnetospheric fields reconnect, it opens a valve or faucet that lets the solar wind energy cross the magnetopause and pour into the magnetosphere," said Dr. Jeffrey Hughes, chairman of the department of astronomy at Boston University. "Without reconnection, the magnetosphere would be a very benign place."Over the past eight years, ISAS's Geotail spacecraft has systematically studied and surveyed the magnetic tail of Earth in search of this process. As a result, scientists have been able to pinpoint the area where reconnection happens in the tail, about 85,000 to 96,000 miles (140,000 to 160,000 kilometers) downwind of the Earth. They have also been able to show that reconnection frequently occurs in the tail shortly before auroras and magnetic disturbances begin in Earth's atmosphere. Nishida and colleagues interpret those results to mean that reconnection is the source of energy behind the auroras and storms.The International Solar-Terrestrial Physics program is a joint scientific study between NASA, ISAS, and the European Space Agency (ESA), with contributions from Russia's Institute for Space Research and many other international science institutions. The primary spacecraft of ISTP include ISAS's Geotail, NASA's Polar and Wind spacecraft, and the joint ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.earthscape.org/t2/chs01/chs01g/chs01gb.html<TEXT>Everyone loves the seasons. They bring different holidays, reasons to celebrate and a change in wardrobe (especially Halloween). The seasons are defined as the yearly change in temperature on our planet. These changes in temperature on our planet are a direct result of the amount of solar radiation that hits our planet at a particular time of year. But what causes the amount of solar radiation that hits our planet to change? Do you think you know what causes the seasons? You better keep reading to make sure...The concepts you are about to learn may require that you unlearn what you think you know. Misconceptions concerning the reasons for the seasons abound. READ THIS NEXT SENTENCE VERY CAREFULLY: The Earth does not get any closer or any further away from the sun as it orbits the sun. The Earth maintains a near-circular orbit around the sun; thus it remains about the same distance from the sun all the time (about 93 million miles). There are very good reasons for the seasons on our planet, but the distance between the Earth and the sun has nothing to do with it.Cement that fact in your head. Write it on a piece of paper and tape it to your bathroom mirror. Then, go to the web link below and answer all the questions. This link will ask you some questions about the seasons and the moon. The moon information will help you with tides at a later date. Concentrate on the seasons information. When you are finished, return to this page.Now that you know a little bit more than when you started, let me provide a full explanation. All of use are aware that the Earth orbits the sun once in 365 days, 5 hours and 48 minutes. We are also aware that in the winter our weather gets colder and in the summer our weather gets hotter. Spring and fall are transition periods between winter and summer. How can this be true if the Earth is NOT CLOSER to the sun in summer and NOT FURTHER from the sun in winter? (Truth is, the Earth is actually a little bit closer to the sun in winter.)The biggest reason that the Earth experiences seasons has to do with the TILT of the Earth on its axis, relative to its plane of orbit. (Recall that a plane is an imaginary flat surface containing some object or objects) A piece of paper defines a plane; the plane of the Earth's orbit is the imaginary flat surface that contains the Earth as it orbits around the sun. If we place the Earth in its plane, we find that the North Pole does not stick straight up and down; it's not perpendicular (at a 90 degree angle) to the plane. The Earth tilts at a 23.5 degree angle relative to the plane. The Earth's axis (the imaginary line around which it rotates) is tilted towards the North Star, Polaris, and this angle measures 23.5 degrees. Got that?The figure at left illustrates the tilt of the Earth on its axis relative to its plane of orbit. If the Earth was not tilted, its axis (the solid line running through the middle of the Earth around which the Earth rotates) would not be tilted; it would be perpendicular to the plane of orbit. But as we can see, the Earth is tilted and as the Earth orbits around the sun, this tilt will have a significant effect on where and how much sunlight a particular portion of the Earth receives. Let's look at the Earth as it rotates around the sun and see how the tilt of the Earth affects the way sunlight reaches different parts of our planet.What do you notice from this figure? First of all, you should observe the direction of the Earth's tilt (away from the sun or towards the sun) at different times of the year? Which way is the Earth tilted in relation to the sun on the Winter Solstice (Dec. 21)? Which way is the Earth tilted in relation to the sun on the Summer Solstice (June 21)? You should be able to see that the Northern Hemisphere is facing away from the sun in winter and towards the sun in summer. But what effect does this have on the amount of sunlight reaching our planet?One effect of the tilt of the Earth in relation to the sun is the angle at which the sun's rays hit the Earth, called the angle of incidence. The figure at left illustrates the angle of incidence for the sun's rays for an Earth with no tilt. It should be pretty apparent to you that the sun hits more directly at the equator and spreads out at the poles. Another way to express this is to say that the amount of solar radiation per unit area is large at the equator and small at the poles. Think of it this way: the same amount of sunlight heats a smaller area at the equator and a larger area at the poles because the sunlight is spread over a greater area at the poles. As you might imagine this effect is exaggerated when we add the Earth's tilt into the equation.Here's a simple demonstration you can try at home that will make the angle-of-incidence concept perfectly clear. You will need a flashlight, a piece of notebook paper, a pen and a ruler. First, turn on the flashlight and hold the notebook paper a couple feet away from it. Hold the flashlight perfectly horizontal and hold the paper perfectly vertical. You should see a focused beam of light on the paper. Draw the outline of the beam of light. Now, tilt the paper backwards at a slight angle (23.5 degrees if you know how much that is!). You should now see that the same beam of light is spread over a greater area of the paper. Draw the outline of the beam hitting the tilted paper.Now measure the area of the two beams (vertical and tilted). If the beams were rectangular, then use length times width. If the beams were circular then measure the radius of the circles, square them (multiply the radius by itself) and multiply that value times pi (3.14159). Now perform the following calculation: assume that the amount of light coming out of the flashlight equals 1000 photons per square inch (this number is totally fabricated and nowhere near the true intensity but it's a convenient number for our purposes here). Calculate the intensity of light per square inch hitting the vertical paper? Calculate the intensity of the light per square inch hitting the tilted paper?It should be fairly obvious to you even without the calculations that the amount of light per unit area is smaller when the paper is tilted. The same thing is true for the Earth. Near the equator, sunlight hits more directly and the solar radiation is more intense (a greater number of photons per square inch or whatever area measurement you choose). At the poles, sunlight is spread over a greater area and solar radiation is diminished (a smaller number of photons per unit area).Let's consider the Earth's orbit in another way. As the Earth orbits the sun, the place on the Earth where sunlight hits directly changes day to day. We perceive this change as a difference in sun angle from day to day. In the summer, we see the sun getting higher in the sky. In the winter, we see the sun getting lower in the sky. This "raising and lowering" of the angle of the sun is a direct result of the Earth's tilt. Besides a change in sun angle, what else is happening between summer and winter?As the Northern Hemisphere moves from winter to summer, the sun "climbs" higher in the sky. You can perhaps visualize this better by stabbing a pencil through the center of an orange (or any piece of round fruit) and orbiting the orange around a lamp. Tilt the orange as you orbit the lamp. In Northern Hemisphere winter (the orange tilted away from the lamp), sunlight hits most directly south of the equator. In Northern Hemisphere summer, the sun hits most directly north of the equator. Remember the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn? Remember their latitudes? Lo and behold, those latitudes were 23.5 degrees North and 23.5 degrees South, respectively. On June 21 in the Northern Hemisphere, our Summer Solstice, the sun reaches its highest angle in the sky and sunlight hits most directly on the Tropic of Cancer. On December 21 in the Northern Hemisphere, our Winter Solstice, the sun reaches its lowest angle in the sky and sunlight hits most directly on the Tropic of Capricorn.A paragraph ago I asked what else was happening and of course, you answered that the length of the days was changing. Not only does the sun hit more directly in our summer but the days are longer as well. Thus, we get more intense solar radiation per unit area of Earth for a longer period of time. What about the Southern Hemisphere? What is happening in the Southern Hemisphere on June 21 and December 21? And what about Spring and Fall, where is the sun during those times of years?To summarize, the tilt of the Earth in relation to its plane of orbit around the sun has the following effects:        * the angle of incidence changes throughout the Earth's orbit        * the apparent sun angle changes throughout the Earth's orbit        * daylength changes throughout the Earth's orbitThe net result of these effects is (drum roll, here): differential heating of our planet. Repeat that word three times: differential heating, differential heating, differential heating. Then repeat it right before you close your eyes to go to sleep at night. Differential heating is the disparity or difference in the amount of heat received by one part of our planet as compared to another. In other words, some regions of our planet receive more heat and some regions of our planet receive less heat. That means that some parts of the planet heat more quickly while others heat more slowly.We will return to this concept of differential heating of the planet when we examine how our planet responds to solar radiation and how heat is distributed in the oceans and the atmosphere. What is important at this point is that you understand WHY our planet heats differently in different parts. And now, you should have a much better understanding of the reasons for the seasons. Prove that you understand it by explaining it to a family member or friend. </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.pacificislandtravel.com/nature_gallery/climate.html<TEXT>ClimateDrama of the SeasonsIn the autumn night sky of the northern hemisphere the constellation Orion appears earlier and stays longer as the nights lengthen. As the days continue to shorten, monarch butterflies fly south. Ocean currents off the coast of California warm the sea as the land cools under the winter skies. In the interior of continents in the northern hemisphere, the leaves of deciduous trees turn to flaming colors before being shed and animals instinctively prepare for the coming season of winter.Six months later these events reverse. Similar changes occur in temperate regions all over the globe, alternating between the Northern and Southern hemispheres. Meanwhile, in the tropics, the seasons alternate between periods of torrential rain and dry periods. The dry season begins with an explosion of blooming plant life and animal activity and ends with a period of wilting and waiting for the coming rainy season.The Cause of SeasonsThe seasons are annual cycles caused by the angle of tilt of the Earth's rotational axis. This tilt remains at an angle of 23 27' as the Earth orbits the sun, making one complete orbit in one year of 365.25 days. Depending on Earth's orbital position, either the southern or northern hemisphere is tipped towards the sun, receiving more direct solar radiation. The fact that the Earth leans either towards or away from the sun has resulted in tremendous change and variation in the physical planet, plant and animal life, and the human experience.Day Length, Solstices, and EquinoxesThe Earth moves around the sun in an elliptical orbit, maintaining a constant tilt. This tilt means that one of the Earth's hemispheres usually receives more sunlight than the other. The hemisphere nearest to the sun at either the June or December solstice receives its maximum possible sun exposure. At these times, the other hemisphere is as far from the sun as it can be, and is thrown into shadow.  )The solstices represent the beginning of summer and winter, causing the daylight hours to be longest on one side of the Equator and shortest on the other. The extremes of the solstices are experienced at the poles, which receive nearly continuous daylight or continuous darkness. Six months later, when the Earth is exactly halfway around its solar orbit, the opposite conditions are experienced.Between the June and December solstices the Earth's axis is positioned sideways towards the sun. When halfway between solstices, the sun's rays strike the Equator perpendicularly, causing both hemispheres to briefly receive equal sunlight. Day length is then the same everywhere. These two positions are known as the equinoxes, marking the beginning of spring and autumn.The TropicsTropical regions experience the least variation in day length between the seasons. Their position near to the centre of the sun's exposure on Earth, means that day length here is never far from average.On the June solstice the sun's rays are perpendicular to Earth at a certain latitude which is either north or south of the equator. On this day, the sun appears to reach its midday height in the exact vertical centre of the sky. These latitudes are the geographical limits of the tropics-the equatorial regions which have a consistently warm climate. The Northern Hemisphere's tropic line is known as the Tropic of Cancer and lies at 23 27' North. The corresponding line in the southern hemisphere is the Tropic of Capricorn, and lies at 23 27' South. Not surprisingly, these angles represent the exact tilt of Earth in its orbit around the sun. If there were no tilt, the sun would always be directly above the equator, and there would be no seasons as we know them.Star PositionsAs the Earth moves, so does its relationship to the stars and other astronomical bodies. Indeed, the stars and planets appear to move around Earth, although it is actually Earth that is moving. This perceived movement of the stars at night has been a major influence in the development of navigation and geography, as well as in the world's cultures and religions. The appearance is complicated by the fact that the planet is both spinning on its own axis and orbiting the sun on another axis. A person's view of the night sky is influenced by the seasonal progression of daylight and the night-time. For example, Orion-a winter constellation in the northern hemishphere-is situated in the daylight sky in midsummer and since the light of the sun is stronger, it cannot be seen. As the seasons progress, the night side of the planet turns toward Orion, which is then visible in the night sky. A slightly different view of the stars is therefore presented each night, and the skyscape is the opposite at the summer (June in the Northern hemisphere) and winter (December) solstices. Constellations near the horizon disappear from view entirely for one season and then gradually appear again.Comets and planets have their own complicated orbits around the sun, so their patterns of movement in the sky do not correspond to the more predictable wanderings of the stars. The position of the stars is also affected by two other factors. First, the Earth's tilt on its axis moves slightly backwards and forwards over a period of many years, altering the celestial view. Second, the stars themselves travel through space on their own trajectories, and the constellations change their shape over many centuries.People have been trying to understand the position of the stars since long before recorded history. Constellations-visual groups of stars that resemble familiar objects-were the first attempt to classify the stars. The constellations recognized by different cultures through time depended on historical precedent, cultural factors, and geography. To locate certain stars for study and navigation, astronomers, astrologers, and navigators still use the constellations familiar to the ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean, Central America, China, and elsewhere.Although the stars have always been important to religion, navigation and agriculture were the main practical reasons for organizing them into recognizable and predictable entities. Stars that appeared to hardly move were particularly valuable in navigation, especially Polaris, the North Star of the northern hemishphere, and the constellation Octans of the southern hemisphere. These are the visible stars most closely aligned with the axis of Earth.Modern astronomy uses star charts to make star navigation more accurate. The stars appear to be spread over the inner surface of a sphere, so star charts have spherical qualities, like a globe turned inside out. They are usually organized into Northern and Southern Hemisphere views that are divided into 24 hours or radial sectors with 180-degree increments between the horizons. Charts of the equatorial skies, up to about 30  north or south of the equatorial horizon, are often represented by rectangular maps which are also divided lengthwise into 24 hours. Star charts are not static like Earth maps because they usually display seasonal views of the sky from a particular point. They can also show the entire sky irrespective of season but with some indication of the seasonal change.ClimateIn temperate regions, winter is a time of short days, long nights, and cooler temperatures. Precipitation is often greater and falls more regularly than in tropical regions. Summer is a time of long days, short nights, warm temperatures, and little or no rainfall.The seasons play a large role in determining the climate across the globe. As summer sunlight warms land masses, overlying air decreases in density and rises, before it settles over the ocean. Ocean-cooled air is then drawn toward the land by the updraft, setting off cycles of air movement that cause major climatic disturbances. These cycles of warming, cooling, and the resulting tumbling air movement generally subside as winter sets in and the contrast between land and ocean temperatures diminishes. These cycles are generally more pronounced in the northern hemisphere because there is a greater proportion of land surface to heat the air. Phenomena such as monsoons and hurricanes represent the extremes of such seasonal weather patterns. Physical Effects of Seasonal ClimateAs the climate changes with the seasons, it directly affects the physical Earth, as well as artificial habitats and human activity. In winter, freezing ice breaks rocks apart as it expands, helping to create soil. Similar action in the crevices of city streets and buildings exerts wear and tear on man-made structures. Heavy seasonal rain scours the terrain and summer winds raise dust, parching the earth with drought.   Modern city life is brought to a standstill by occasionally powerful winter storms, but in the far north of Russia, Canada, and Alaska, some residents await the freezing of major waterways to provide icy highways for transporting goods.Ocean CurrentsSeasonal change also affects the oceans. The massive amount of water in the seas absorbs a great deal of the sun's energy, which it then stores for a long time. The seasons do not produce the dramatic temperature fluctuations which are felt on land, but they do produce seasonal winds, that create surface currents.Examples of this are the California current off the Pacific coast of North America and the Kuroshio current off the Pacific coast of Japan. These change the direction of their flow from clockwise in the summer to anti-clockwise in the winter. Along the Pacific coast of North America, warm surface water flows northwards in winter and cold arctic water flows southwards in summer.The Coriolis force is produced by the Earth's rotation. It causes the wind (or any object moving relative to the surface of the Earth) to move to the right of its expected course in the Northern Hemisphere, or to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The result is that deep ocean water moves at right angles to the surface current. In summer, the movement is toward the land, causing downflow.In winter, this reverses and it flows away from shore, drawing up deep water in its wake. This is known as upwelling. Seasonal mixing of deep and shallow water is an important factor in the biology of the oceans because sea life depends on recycling of the nutrients that accumulate in the deep ocean. Ocean fish harvests are often seasonal because of upwelling.Biological PatternsSeasonal change has profoundly influenced the survival and evolution of life on Earth. Animals and plants, especially those in temperate regions, have incorporated seasonal survival strategies into their life cycles.Most species are diminished during winter. In temperate zones, cold weather and short days bring starvation and a constant struggle against the elements. Many animals and plants, especially the weak and old, die. Populations are naturally trimmed to leave only the fittest individuals, which has the effect of improving survival in future generations.The leaves of plants are solar energy collectors. The leaves of herbaceous and many broad-leaved deciduous species are useless in the winter climate of temperate regions because solar radiation is minimal and temperatures are too cold for photosynthesis. As frost settles, these plants cut off the flow of nutrients to the leaves, reabsorbing the valuable green chlorophyll and causing the leaves to turn the yellow and red colours of autumn. Finally the leaves drop off the tree. Deciduous plants survive the winter with their energy reserves efficiently stored in their roots.Other plants use a variety of strategies to survive winter. Evergreen trees such as pines, cedars, and hemlocks retain their leaves. They have more primitive, yet successful strategies for conserving energy and tissue in cold or freezing weather. Some plants return all their energy to bulbs or corms under the soil or as seeds or spores. They are then ready to resprout when spring arrives.As winter approaches, many mammals perform elaborate rituals and begin to look or fight for mates. Hairy animals grow thicker coats over layers of fat and the plumages of birds are renewed. Mammals such as the snowshoe hare and the arctic fox change their fur completely to camouflage with the snow. Animals in temperate climates have evolved patterns of behaviour that help them to prepare for winter. Honeybees, squirrels, and some birds frantically gather and store food, whilst bears overeat in preparation.Many animals hibernate during the months of winter-their metabolism slows and they fall into a deep sleep, living off their summer fat stores, awakening only once or twice to sniff the air for signs of spring. Insects undergo a similar resting state known as diapause, which occurs during a particular stage of development-egg, larva, pupa, or adult, depending on the species.In temperate zones summers can be as challenging as winters. Some plants have adapted to the extremes of summer to avoid moisture loss. Desert species, such as certain desert grasses and trees, die back to their roots or drop their leaves.Animal MigrationAmong the many seasonal habits of animals, migration is perhaps the most dramatic. Some hummingbirds migrate thousands of kilometres between continents as the seasons change. The arctic tern breeds and spends its summers in the Canadian and Alaskan tundra, before flying to the Antarctic for the winter. Chinook and sockeye salmon migrate once in their lives, when they leave their ocean habitat and return to the exact stream where they were hatched from eggs. This final journey is triggered by seasonal changes. Monarch butterflies migrate south in the autumn, leaving their summer feeding grounds in temperate North America to live in communities in Mexico that may host millions of individuals.  They travel up to 5,000 kilometres (3,100 miles). In spring they begin the first leg of the return journey, stopping to feed, mate, and lay eggs as they go. The entire circuit is completed in late summer by the second or third generation.The seasons have a profound effect on the lives of many of the Earth's inhabitants, including human beings.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.school-for-champions.com/science/earth_motion.htm<TEXT>One of the important characteristics of the Earth is its movement. Seeing the Sun move through the sky is a result of the fact that the Earth rotates on its axis. As with all planets in our Solar System, the Earth orbits or moves around the Sun. The Earth's axis is slightly tilted with respect to its orbit around the Sun, resulting in the change of seasons. The Earth also follows the Sun in its motion through space. The various motions result in days, seasons and years.    * How long is a single rotation of the Earth on its axis?    * What factors does rotating around the Sun affect?    * What other motions does the Earth have?This lesson will answer your questions. You can take a mini-quiz at the end of the lesson.Rotates on its axisThe Earth is a sphere that rotates on its axis that passes through the North and South poles. The time it takes for the Earth to make a complete rotation is approximately 24 hours (exactly 23.934 hours). This rotation results in daytime when an area is facing the Sun and nighttime when an area is facing away from the Sun.The Earth rotates on its axis Since we are on Earth, we do not sense its rotation, but we experience it by observing the relative motion of the Sun. It is similar to what you experience when you are sitting in a moving automobile and see the surroundings move by.Revolves around the SunThe Earth revolves around the Sun once every 365.25 days. Its velocity in space in its orbit is about 18.5 miles per second.The shape of the orbit is an ellipse. Seldom--if ever--is an astronomical orbit a true circle.The Earth rotates in an elliptical orbit around the Sun Leap yearsSince a year has been designated as 365 days, a day is added every 4 years to even things out. That year is called a "Leap Year" and occurs on years divisible by 4, such as 2004. The extra day in a leap year is added in February.Actually, the period is slightly less than 365.25 days. Thus a leap year is any year divisible by 4, except for years that are both divisible by 100 and not divisible by 400. Therefore, the year 2000 was a leap year, but the years 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not. That is complicated, but then again, who wants things easy?SeasonsThe axis of the Earth is on a slight tilt with respect to the orbit around the Sun. That tilt is always in the same direction and results in the changing seasons on the Earth.The tilt of the Earth is in the same directionThe reason the seasons change has to do with how direct the Sun is shining, as well as the length of a day.SummerWhen the Earth is in the part of the orbit around the Sun where the sunlight shines more directly on the Earth, the days are longer and less sunlight is reflected. That is summer, and the weather becomes warmer.Sunlight shines more directly in summer Due to the spherical shape of the Earth, there is more daylight in the summer the closer you get to the pole. One you cross the Arctic Circle in the Northern Hemisphere in summer or the Antarctic Circle in the summer in the Southern Hemisphere, a day can be 24 hours long. That is why they can it "the land of the midnight Sun."WinterOn the other side of the orbit around the Sun, the angle of the sunlight is steeper, resulting in more light being reflected. Also, the days are shorter. This results in the colder weather of winter.Sunlight reflects off steeper angle in winter Since the orbit of the Earth around the Sun is an ellipse, surprisingly, the Earth is closer to the Sun for a Northern Hemisphere winter than it is in the summer. That would imply that the Southern Hemisphere has slightly colder winters and warmer summers than the Northern.Other motionBesides spinning on its axis and rotating around the Sun, the Earth also follows the Sun's movement through the Milky Way galaxy. The Sun and its planets are moving toward the star Vega at a velocity of about 12 miles per second. The Sun and Vega are rotating about the center of the Milky Way at about 150 miles per second.The Milky Way--in turn--is moving through space, as part of the apparent expansion of the Universe. Its estimate velocity is thousands of miles per second depending on which galaxy you compare it.Since the distances are so great, we will never notice these motions with respect to the other stars and galaxies in the immense Universe.In conclusionThe Earth spins on its axis and rotates around the Sun. The tilt of its axis with respect to the Sun causes the Earth's seasons. The Earth also follows the Sun's rotation around the center of the Milky Way galaxy, which is moving through space.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/weather/1.html<TEXT>Lesson 1: There Is A SeasonSpring, summer, fall, and winter. Each year we go through the changes of seasons. Cold winter weather transforms into a mild spring, that progresses into a warm summer, that finally cools off into fall. Why do we go through these changes? It all has to do with the angle that the sun's rays hit the earth's surface.Think of the earth as a spinning top. Instead of spinning straight up and down though, it is tilted to one side. Because the earth is tilted to one side, the angle of the sun's rays changes as the earth travels around the sun. For example, during the winter, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, so the sun is not very high in the sky. In the summer, the Earth is tilted toward the sun, and the sun is higher in the sky. The higher in the sky the sun is, the more direct the sun's rays hit the earth. This makes the earth heat up more.Sunrise at Different Times of the YearWatching the sunrise throughout the year, you will notice that the sun does not always rise in the same place. This is also related to the earth's tilt. In the winter, the sun will rise in the southeast. As it gets closer to spring the sunrise will move to the north. On the first day of spring (The Spring or Vernal Equinox), the sun will rise directly in the east. During the spring, the sunrise will continue to move north, and will be rising in the northeast by the first day of summer. Then, it will start to move south again, and will be rising directly in the east on the first day of fall (The Fall or Autumnal Equinox). The southward motion will continue until the first day of winter, and the cycle will start over.Activity One - I See the LightMaterials: Globe, flashlight or lampSetting Up the Activity: Have someone hold the globe about five feet from the light source, with the north pole tilted away from the light source. If using a flashlight, you may need to change this distance to get good coverage. Spin the earth and notice how the light hits the globe.Keeping the light source in the same location, have the earth "orbit" the sun in a circle. After traveling halfway around the circle, spin the earth (the North Pole should now be tilted toward the light source) and see how the light hits the globe. Note areas near the poles.Questions:Q. How does the position of the earth change the way the light hits the globe?A. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the light, the light is hitting the surface more directly. This would coincide with our summer. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, the light hits the surface less directly. This coincides with our winter.Q. What happens at the North Pole at these positions?A. During our summer, the North Pole is receiving light all the time. In winter, the North Pole is receiving no light.Q. Is there any time when both north and south poles receive light?Yes, at the equinoxes. One pole is at "sunset" and the other is at "sunrise."Activity Two - Grab Some RaysMaterials: Black marker, pencil, clear jar at least six inches tall, white poster board, glue, used matchstick, thread, aluminum foil, scotch tapeSetting Up the Activity: This activity will make a radiometer, a simple device that gives a measure of solar energy. Cut the poster board so you have four pieces of 1/2 inch by 1-inch rectangles. Color one side of the poster board with the black marker. Glue aluminum foil to the white side of the poster board pieces. Next, glue one edge of the poster board to a side of the matchstick. Do this with each piece of poster board, making sure the foil sides do not face each other. It should look like a paddlewheel when you're done, with the paddle at one end of the matchstick. With a five-inch length of thread, glue one end of the thread to the top of the matchstick (end away from the poster board pieces). Tape the other end of the thread to the middle of the pencil. Suspend the paddlewheel in the jar. Place the jar in a sunny location.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.geocities.com/jammuinfo/2.html (versions of this in many places)<TEXT>Earth, our planet, is the only planet in the solar system known to harbor life. All of the things we need to survive are provided under a thin layer of atmosphere that separates us from the uninhabitable void of space. Earth is made up of complex, interactive systems that are often unpredictable. Air, earth, land, and humans themselves combine forces to create a constantly changing world that we are striving to understand.NASA, in partnership with other U.S. and international agencies, has been studying Earth as an integrated system. Viewing Earth from the unique perspective of space provides the opportunity to see Earth as a whole. Scientists around the world have discovered many things about our planet by working together and sharing their findings.Photo: This Apollo 10 view of Earth was taken during a journey to the Moon in May 1969. While clouds obscure the Yucatan peninsula, nearly all of Mexico north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec is clearly visible. The Gulf of California, Baja, and the San Joaquin Valley of California are all identifiable as well. In the upper right corner, the northern polar cap appears with pressure fronts emanating to the south.Some facts are well known. For instance, Earth is the third planet from the Sun, and the fifth largest in the solar system. Earth's diameter is just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus. Our planet rotates on its axis at a surface speed of approximately 0.5.km/sec at mid-latitudes, while orbiting the sun at a speed about.30km/sec. We experience these motions as the daily routine of sunrise and sunset and in the slower change of the seasons. The four seasons are a result of Earth's axis of rotation being titled more than 23 degrees.The changing nature of the planet's systems are the mysteries that scientist study today. For instance, the North American continent continues to move west over the Pacific Ocean basin, roughly at a rate equal to the growth of our fingernails. We are made aware of this movement when it is interrupted by earthquakes. Scientists notice a distinctive pattern to those earthquakes, leading them to conclude that Earth is dynamic, with its spherical surface separated into moving caps or plates. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another, ride up over one another, collide to make mountains, or split and separate. These movements are known as plate tectonics. Developed within the last thirty years, this explanation has unified the results of centuries of study of our planet, long believe to the static.Oceans at least 4km deep covers nearly 70% of Earth's surface. Water exist in the liquid phase only within a narrow temperature span (0 degrees to 100 degrees C). This temperature span is especially narrow when contrasted with the full range of temperatures found within the solar system. The presence and distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere is responsible for much of the Earth's weather.On the surface, we are enveloped by an ocean of air that consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other constituents. Earth's atmosphere shields us from nearly all harmful radiation coming from the Sun, and protects us from meteors as well--most of which burn up before they can strike the surface. Satellites have revealed that the upper atmosphere, which was though to be clam and uneventful, actually swells by day and contracts by night due to solar activity. The upper atmosphere contributes to Earth's weather and climate and protects us from the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras, or the Northern and Southern lights.Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give rise to a magnetic field, which the solar winds distort into a teardrop shape. The solar wind is a stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the Sun. The magnetic field does not fade off into space, but has definite boundaries.As your observe Earth's finite boundaries, depicted on the front of this lithograph, consider the many unanswered questions and discoveries yet to be made on our own home planet. </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1991/6/91.06.01.x.html<TEXT>Looking at the various records left by nature, we have found that global changes have taken place on earth throughout it's history. The question is why? This unit will attempt to help the student understand the complexities for getting definitive answers for these past and present happenings in our environment. We read many things these days from various sources about the cause and effect of what is happening in our present environment. The student needs to be made aware of past global changes on earth and the evidence for why these changes took place before believing everything they read.BACKGROUND/WEATHER-CLIMATEThe average weather conditions of an area over a long period of time constitutes its climate. Some of the factors that determine these conditions are elevation, relationship to the equator, nearness to large bodies of water, size, topography, and location of landmasses. Though we are going to concentrate on landmasse positions and climate, it is necessary to have an understanding of the basic factors that go into determining the climate of an area.As we know, students like hands on activities. To make the topic more interesting and meaningful, we will have the student do some activities that will help them better understand the effects positions of landmasses and large bodies of water have on climate. I think we should begin by measuring and researching some weather elements as these effects can be measured and observed over a smaller time scale than climate. By discussing why conditions might vary during the day and throughout the year and then discussing the global effects these would have on the earth over a long period of time,I believe, might help them better understand effects events have on climate over a long period of time.Break the class into groups and discuss the basic weather elements and where each is found on a weather map.    1. Temperature    2. Air Pressure    3. Relative Humidity    4. Clouds-cover/types    5. Winds-speed/direction    6. Dew Point    7. Precipitation-past/present TEMPERATUREWe probably should begin by talking about temperature. Temperature, which involves molecular activity, can be measured with a thermometer. To introduce this idea, a good lesson is found in Introduction to Earth Science by Norman Abraham, Donald Chaney , Michael Moores, Robert Swift, Jerome Notkin and published by Rand McNally Company 1972.To start the student thinking, place a one hole stopper containing a 30 cm glass tube with a plug of colored water that will move up or down into a flask containing only air. Covering and uncovering the flask with your hand will cause the plug to rise or fall. Have the students explain why this happens. You might also want to try using a two hole stopper and inserting a thermometer into one of the holes to see if a change in temperature can be observed. Trial and error? (see fig. 1) We are aware that temperatures at or near the equator are higher than those at or near the poles. What could cause some of these differences?An activity that appears in several textbooks is to take a flashlight and shine it on graph paper both head on an at an angle from the same height. Have the students notice the light intensity and also the area covered. After doing this do the same thing but this time use a thermometer angled and perpendicular to the light source and record the temperature over a period of time. These activities should help the student realize that a locations latitude has an effect on the daily temperature. You might also bring in the fact that the suns rays also travel through more atmosphere away from the equator thus filtering, absorbing, and reflecting more energy than near the equator.Temperature is also affected by altitude. As we ascend into the atmosphere the temperature decreases. Show the class pictures of areas that are nice and green and warm but in the background there are mountains covered with snow. Ask them how this could happen. Mountain building, by subduction, is one of the results of Plate Tectonics. Mountains have a bearing on the precipitation and temperature of an area by causing the air to condense and cool as it rises over the mountain.Ocean currents can also affect the temperature of an area by bringing warm or cool currents to an area which cause conditions to be more stable by preventing wide temperature ranges as water warms more slowly than land and also cools off less rapidly than land.A heat exchange experiment is helpful at this time. Fill a styrofoam cup with hot water and another with cold water. Cover and connect each cup with a metal rod. Place a thermometer in each cup and observe the temperature changes in each cup and the final temperature in each cup. Oceans also effect the temperature of an area by cloud formation. As evaporation takes place at the surface it rises, cools and forms clouds. These clouds block out radiation from the sun which in turn causes the oceans to cool off. After cloud formation is reduced, the oceans will again begin to absorb radiant energy from the sun and the warming trend will begin again.A way of observing the effects of blocking solar radiation is to check the effects of the oil fields burning in Kuwait. You will see that the temperature has decreased due to the smoke blocking out the radiation from the sun.Other activities that can be performed are the heating and cooling of sand and water, the heating and cooling of water in a shiny aluminum container and a black container to help the student realize how water, land and ice can effect temperature and heat.Air PressureAir pressure is affected by temperature, water vapor and elevation. We measure air pressure with an instrument called a barometer. This instruments indicates the condition of the atmosphere. As the air rises the pressure lessens causing the barometer to have a lower reading. If this air is saturated at ground level it will condense to a liquid at higher cooler elevations. The opposite happens for high pressure. Dry cool air descends causing the barometer to register a higher reading.Relative HumidityRelative humidity can be measured with a wet and dry bulb thermometer called a psychrometer. This gives an indication as to how much water vapor is in the air compared to how much it can hold at that temperature and pressure.CLOUDSClouds are formed when moisture in the air condenses around solid particles in the atmosphere. There are three basic cloud types and these three types combine with one another to form all the other cloud types. Each is associated with a certain type of weather. (see fig. 2)The three main types are:    1. Cumulus: Low level & puffy clouds    2. Stratus: Middle level & sheets    3. Cirrus: High level & thin I suggest that you give each group a chart showing the shapes, elevations and names of the various cloud types to help them with their identification.WINDWind is defined as air in motion. This movement is caused by warm air rising producing a low pressure area and cooler air replacing it from an area of higher pressure. The greater the difference in pressure between these two areas, the stronger the wind. Wind speed and direction can be found by using a wind vane and anemometer.A fun activity might be to heat a surface and close by place a container of ice. Place a pin wheel or an object that releases smoke between the two surfaces to see if air motion can be detected.DEW POINTDew point is the point at which water vapor in the air will condense to a liquid. We can find this temperature by placing some ice cubes in a glass of water to lower the temperature of the water. As the water temperature decreases record the temperature when moisture is first observed on the outside of the glass. This is called the dew point and if the temperature of the air reaches this point under the same conditions some form of precipitation will occur.PRECIPITATIONPrecipitation is water that falls to the earth in the form of rain, snow, sleet or hail. A precipitation gauge is used to measure the amount that has fallen. We should take time at the beginning of each period for about one week to measure these weather elements. Rotate the responsibilities of each group and check your results with the weather channel if possible. Use your bulletin board to post your information so each class can compare their results as each is taken at a different time during the day. You might want to use a chart similar to the one you will see on the next page.Assign each group a research activity of finding weather conditions over the past year. Each group could do about a two month record. You might also want them to do a gnomon measuring shadow lines at various times of the year to show the sun's elevation. This information can be found in the Interaction of Earth and Time text by Rand McNally.CLIMATE ZONES:There are three major climate regions on earth. Each is based on the average weather conditions of the area. (see fig. 3)They are:    Polar-60-90 degrees north or south of the equator. Polar zones are the coldest of the three zones. Polar zones not only do not receive as much radiation from the sun as other latitudes but they also include ice caps which reflect the sun's rays slowing down the warming process.    Temperate-30-60 degrees north or south of the equator. The temperate zone is affected by both tropical and polar air masses. If nearer the polar latitudes one generally gets snow during the winter season and rain if nearer the tropical latitudes. Generally weather conditions vary more between seasons in this latitude than with the other two.    Tropical-0-30 degrees north or south of the equator. This zone has the highest temperatures and as it receives the most solar radiation throughout the year. An important event in this latitude is the monsoon. This brings much needed rain into the area during the summer season and when winter arrives the winds reverse their direction to become dry and cool. Each region has it's special type of global wind pattern caused by this unequal heating which is influenced by mountains, direction of the prevailing wind, nearness to large bodies of water and the Coriolis effect which is the tendency for things in the northern hemisphere to turn to the right and just the opposite in the southern hemisphere because of earth rotation. (see fig. 4)CAUSE AND EVIDENCE OF CLIMACTIC CHANGEMan has not been on the earth since the beginning of time to measure and record the changes in the earth's climate. However, nature has done her part by leaving detectors that supply information about the early earth through:    1. Radioactive dating-oldest rock about 4.1 billion years old.    2. Tree rings-Accurate to about 10,000 years ago.    3. Fossils-Environment and evolution.    4. Ice Cores-Accurate to about 150.000 years ago.    5. Ocean floor samples-Accurate to about 160,000,000 million years ago.    6. Corals-Indication of changing sea level. Now the question is why have these changes taken place?1. Change of solar flux distribution on the earth.    A. Evidence now exists that the shape of the earths orbit changes from round to elliptical in 100,000 cycles.    B. The tilt of the axis of the earth changes at 40,000 year cycles.    C. Precession (wobbling)-operates on a 20,000 year cycle. These factors effect the amount and intensity of the solar radiation received by the earth causing it to become warmer or cooler. We are presently the farthest from the sun. 2. Continental Movement.It is now quite evident that the positions of the continents have changed over time. The fit of the landmasses if put together like a jig-saw puzzle, the location of fossils after connecting the landmasses, location of rocks in mt. ranges after fit, paleomagnetism and evidence of glaciers in areas now to warm to support this activity. These movements affect the heat exchange on the earth as we demonstrated earlier with the investigations with land, water, shiny and dark objects. If you look at fig. 5 you will notice that the landmasses are moving toward the northern hemisphere. This movement makes more land available near the poles for ice build up thus affecting sea level and temperature.3. EnvironmentalAs life evolved, the composition of the atmosphere changed. As carbon dioxide decreases in the atmosphere the earth becomes cooler, ice storage increases and sea level lowers. The opposite occurs when carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increased. Increasing the water vapor in the atmosphere might stimulate cloud formation blocking out radiation from the sun and cause the earth to cool down. As the earth cools down, there is less cloud formation and a warming trend may begin. This cycle probably keeps repeating itself.4. Changes in the Solar ConstantChanges in the solar constant or the output of light from the sun has increased with time. 30 million years ago we received 30% less heat from the sun.PLATE TECTONICS AND CONTINENTAL DRIFTTo me curiosity killed the cat but satisfaction brought him back can best describe why man has and continues to learn more about the world we live in. An example would be people not listening to the church teaching of the earth being about 6,000 years old and not changing. James Hutton was one such person. His observations of extinct volcanoes, igneous rock intrusion (prevailing belief at that time was all rocks were formed by deposition),rate of erosion of an ancient wall which was built in 200 AD that did not show effects of erosion made him realize that it would take millions of years for a mountain to erode and finally his observations of rock layers not all being horizontal gave more evidence of a dynamic earth. It was observed that fossils of the same organism on continents thousands of miles apart, glacial deposits in tropical latitudes, same rock structures in mountains separated by oceans, and the shape of the continents. Alfred Wegner put these continents together and called it Pangea which means all land. His idea did not get support because at that time no one could explain what forces could move these large masses of land.We now have the information to answer that question. We know the earth's surface consist of plates surrounded by mid-ocean ridges and trenches. These plates float on a layer of the mantle called the Asthenosphere. A way of showing how this operates is to place some wood blocks together in a pan containing corn syrup. Heat the corn syrup and have the student observe the motion of the wood blocks due to the convection movement within the corn syrup. The movement of plates result in their coming into contact with other plates. When this happen they may:    1. Diverge-drift apart    2. Convergent-come together    3. Transform-slide/grind past The above movements are important as they have an impact on the climate of an area. For example, mountain building has a bearing on the amount of moisture and area will receive, drifting apart changes their latitude which influences the amount of solar radiation and materials escaping into the atmosphere from these activities affect the atmospheric composition. Look at these fig. 5 showing the positions of the earth's landmasses in the past, present and future.THE EARLY CLIMATEThe lack of a rock record makes it difficult to study the early earth. Due to the movements of the earth's lithosphere the rocks have been recycled destroying any evidence that might have existed. The early atmosphere probably contained a plentiful amount of carbon dioxide for the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect was important as the sun's energy output was much less at this time. The earth's interior was warmer at this time and probably a great deal of volcanic activity was taking place. Theses eruptions are believed to have put water vapor into the atmosphere to form clouds blocking even more radiation from the sun cooling the earth thus starting the first rains.Degassing of earth's interior furnished the water for ocean development. The oceans then stored heat and evaporation took place to supply the atmosphere with more water vapor for cloud formation and the cycle kept repeating itself.There was no free oxygen in the atmosphere at this time so ozone could not be formed to filter the ultraviolet radiation which is harmful to living things. The climate was warm, humid and rainy when early life forms first appeared about 3.8 billion years ago. These primitive life forms probably added oxygen to the atmosphere which helped to start the ozone layer.Around 1.4 billion years ago, enter the eukaryotic cell. This is the greatest single leap in evolution as sexual reproduction allowed for a wider variety of organism to evolve. Increased oxygen production was also taking place.PRESENT CLIMATEOur present atmosphere consists mainly of nitrogen and oxygen but carbon dioxide, water vapor and pollutants play an important part in climate production. Although the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is small the effects are great. This gas is needed by organisms for photosynthesis,the process by which some organisms make their own food. This gas also plays an important part in the greenhouse effect. Water vapor varies from place to place in the atmosphere. Two main reason for this are the temperature of the air and the nearness of large bodies of water. As water vapor absorbs energy from the sun we can see it as an important climate factor. Pollutants are constantly being added to our atmosphere naturally or by man. These pollutants may effect the amount of solar radiation reaching the earth, increase the greenhouse effect and/or destroy the ozone layer. More information must be gathered about the past before we can truly tell their effects.As for our present climate conditions, the polar zones average temperatures are below 10 degrees celsius. Little precipitation falls in this zone. Most areas of Alaska are in this zone.The temperate zone has temperatures ranging from 10 to 18 degrees celsius and receives precipitation in the form of snow and rain. The continental United States are in this zone. The tropical zone has the highest temperatures and also very humid. It stays above 18 degrees celsius. Most areas of Hawaii are in this zone.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.surf2000.de/user/f-heeke/article1.html<TEXT>A fluid in a glass rotates, when eccentrically shaken. My hypothesis: Such "shaker effects" play an important role in celestial mechanics, driving and controlling the rotation of sun and planets.  The assumed mechanism of  interaction is described in following chapters. "Shaker effects" are probably of influence also on our weather and climate.1. Shaker-Effects - Definition and ExplanationThe phenomenon of a rotating fluid in a shaken glass is well-known.  The fluid derives its spin angular momentum from the eccentric motion, the axis of rotation stands upright to the plane of shaking. There is, to my knowledge, no technical term for this phenomenon, so the term "shaker effects" is being used here. A spinning plate on an artists rod follows the same law of physics, likewise a weight, which is being swung around on a string. The angular momentum transfer in "shaker effects" depends on the pattern of shaking, and the eccentricity  of the shaken mass. Masses at different radii react differently to a particular pattern of shaking and swinging. That is easily noticed, when swinging around masses on strings of different length. It is also easily noticed, that "shaker effects" occur only in case of eccentric shaking. There are no "shaker effects" in case of a circular motion.General ideas about shaker motions in celestial mechanics are not new.  Galilei Galileo studied water movements in a shaken vase about 400 years ago.  He tried, to explain the phenomenon of the tides with his experiments. Galileo pointed out, that the rotation of earth, in combination with its motion around sun, leads to an acceleration and deceleration of earth's surface every 12 hours, Refs - (01). Galileo's theory of the tides was rejected later, but nevertheless may be partly correct, if earth's swinging motion about the barycentre of the Earth-Moon system is being taken into account.As a mechanical engineer and amateur astronomer I have done some research into shaker effects for more than 20 years, stimulated by a paper of  Paul D. Jose (1965):  "Sun's motion and sunspots" - Refs  - (02).  As is known, most central celestial bodies are being shaken around eccentrically by their satellite(s). This produces, according to my theory,  spin angular momentum in these central bodies, if they are gaseous, liquid, or to a certain extent elastic.  The axis of rotation then tends to stand upright to the plane of shaking, which is the mean orbital plane of the satellite(s).  Gaseous central bodies will show a differential rotation, since their masses at different radii react differently to a particular shaking and swinging motion.I cannot prove my theory as yet. It requires mathematical modeling and testing.  The outlined ideas may be wrong in details, but I am confident, that the underlying basic assumptions are correct. Some suggestions for testing my theory are outlined in chapter 6. 2. Sun's Motion and Sunspots2.1 Sun's MotionPaul D Jose calculated and analyzed sun's motion about the center of mass of the solar system for the years from 1843 to 2013.  He  compared his research results  with the then available sunspot curves. Finding a correlation between sun's motion and solar activity, he concluded:  "The relationships set forth here imply, that certain dynamic forces exerted on the sun by the motion of the planets, are the cause of the sunspot activity", .and furthermore:  "Similar preliminary studies for the earth and moon indicate, that weather conditions may be dependent on such forces".Sun's motions, as calculated by Jose, are partly shown in - Figure-1 . It occurred to me, that the mentioned "certain dynamic forces" are producing the described "shaker effects". This leads, in my opinion, to following basic explanation of solar activities:2.2 SunspotsShaker effects are driving and controlling the rotation of our sun, thereby producing a differential rotation, since  masses at different radii are reacting differently to sun's eccentric motion. Frictions between differentially rotating masses then produce the turbulences and whirls, which we observe as sunspots and solar activities. The intensity of solar activities varies according to changes in sun's motion, and sunspot polarities reverse, whenever the pattern of shaking changes.Our sun is moving about the center of mass of the solar system alternately along larger and smaller eccentric loops, as shown in  Figure-1. Sun's motion along each one of those loops corresponds in principle with the duration of one solar cycle, as marked.  Whenever sun travels from one loop towards or into the next one, there is a basic change in sun's velocity and in the curvature of its motion. The pattern of shaking thus changes, and with it the differential rotation. Masses, which are pushing ahead, when sun is being shaken along a large loop, are falling back, when sun is travelling along a small loop, and vice versa. This causes a reversal in energy- transfer,  which we observe as a reversal in sunspot polarities.Variations in the general and  differential rotation of our sun, in relation to solar cycles, are described in several research papers - Refs - (03)-(06).  This appears to support my explanation. Variations in sun's general rotation  are also quite plausible in this connection: The mechanical energy, which goes into the whirls of sunspots, is being diverted from sun's rotational energy. Sun's rotation thus is slowing down with the appearance of sunspots. Our sun rotates  faster, whenever there are no or only few sunspots. A comparison with earth's rotation lies at hand: The length of a day on earth (LOD) varies from day to day by milliseconds. This is being explained by turbulences in our atmosphere,  Ref. - (10). 3. Rotation of Sun and Planets3.1 Rotation of Central BodiesShaker effects are driving and controlling the rotation of sun and planets, but this does not mean, that all their spin angular momentum must have been produced in this way. Some of it may have been derived from the formation process. However, the satellites, planets and moons, carry the bulk of their system's total angular momentum, and with this they have a controlling influence on the rotational period of their central mass. They also control the position of its axis of rotation, which tends to stand upright to the mean orbital plane of the satellites.Publications  Refs   (25) and (26)  are describing in mathematical terms a correlation between the rotational period of a central mass, and the masses and orbital periods of its satellites. This indicates, that an exchange of angular momentum takes place between satellites and their central mass. However, transfer of angular momentum in celestial systems is not one- sided, towards the central mass only. Some transfer and balancing may occur also from a central mass towards its satellite(s), and between the satellites themselves within a system. As is known, the orbit of Mars- moon Phobos is contracting, meaning a transfer of angular momentum towards the spin of Mars. On the other hand, our moon's orbit is slowly expanding, meaning a transfer of angular momentum from earth to moon. Earth's rotation is slowing down.  Textbooks say, these phenomena are because of "tidal drag" and "tidal friction", Refs - (14). My view is, that "shaker effects" are also involved in this.The controlling influence of satellites on the axis of rotation of their central mass is being confirmed in several research reports,  for instance -  Refs ( 07) : "...Because of the gravitational pull exerted by their masses, planets make their star wobble....."  However, here again "shaker effects" are probably more involved than gravitational forces. The controlling influence of our moon on earth's axis of rotation is being described in - Ref (09).3.2 Planetary RingsMy assumption is, that the spinning of a planet can be accelerated by "shaker-effects" up to the point of disintegration. Planetary matter then may escape at the planet's equator, forming planetary rings. This possibly under combined influence of centrifugal-, eruptive- and other forces. The escaped matter, once in orbit, then may mix up with matter captured from outside (meteoritic material etc).Figure-2  shows, roughly calculated, the eccentric motion of planets Jupiter and Saturn about the center of mass of their planetary system. Their motions are naturally much narrower and faster than those of the sun. Both planets are being shaken along one complete loop in less than 20 days. As a result, a rapid rotation of Jupiter and Saturn can be expected.Planetary rings exist, as far as we know, only around the rapidly spinning planets Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, here mentioned in order of size of their ring system. These planets show, in the same order, a rather favourable ratio of equatorial velocity to escape- or orbital velocity ( Figure-2  / Table 2).  This appears to be a strong argument in support of my thesis.As may be seen, there is a remarkable difference in the shaking- pattern of Jupiter and Saturn (Figure 2). The eccentric motion of Saturn is rather smooth, that of Jupiter more turbulent. This should show up in the surface structure of these planets. It seems indeed to be reflected in Jupiter's more turbulent surface (Red Spot, differential rotation etc).3.3 Mean Density of Planets and SunCelestial bodies have a natural tendency to contract under influence of self-gravity. This process is opposed by centrifugal forces in case of a rotating body. The rapidly spinning giant planets, as a consequence, can be expected to have a rather low mean density. Data in  Table 2  suggest, that for planets a distinct relationship exists between equatorial velocity, escape- or orbital velocity (mass), mean density, and ellipticity. The faster a planet rotates, the lower is its mean density.The assumed relationship can be expected to prevail in principle also in case of sun and other stars. This then means, that sun's diameter and mean density are changing, whenever sun's rotation is speeding up or slowing down in the course of solar cycles. 4.  Origin and Structure of the Solar SystemNew ideas about the origin and structure of our solar system will come up, once it can be proven, that the planets are indeed driving and controlling the rotation of our sun:Our solar system, according to most prevailing theories, was formed out of a rotating nebular disk. Sun, planets and moons are supposed to have been formed from the same nebular material, coming into being at about the same time. However, these theories have problems with explaining the distribution of angular momentum. Our sun holds more than 99 % of the total mass, but only about 2 % of solar system's total angular momentum (Ref 14). This implies under prevailing theories,  that sun must have lost most of its initial angular momentum to the outer members of  the system. How this could have happened, is difficult to explain.The distribution of solar system's angular momentum explains itself, should my theory be proven true. Likewise the position of sun's axis of rotation and equator level, which are being forced into their present  position by the planets.With this it becomes conceivable and more likely, that at least some of the bodies in our solar system formed separately and independently from our sun. Some planets, moons and other bodies may have been captured, coming from distant regions of the universe, assembling around sun gradually over time.We know, that man made satellites can leave our solar system, ending up perhaps in another star system. In a similar way also larger natural celestial bodies might travel from one star system to another. Mass loss of a star, for instance, may reduce its gravitational attraction to an extent, that outer planets or moons can leave the system, wandering around in universe till joining another system.If there is an exchange of angular momentum within the solar system as described, one may expect a distinct tendency in it. The planets possibly are arranging themselves in a way, that perturbations are minimized, and an optimum of orbit-stability is being achieved. This then might be reflected in the Titius-Bode law. 5. Shaker Effects and Climate VariationsThere are following main mechanism, by which shaker effects may influence our weather and climate:- Variations in rotation of sun: Our sun is, at times,  apparently rotating faster or slower,  Refs - (04)-(06). This is, in my opinion, because of shaker effects, as described.  Faster or slower rotations then are going along with variations in solar radius,  Refs - (16)-(18), which means changes in sun's density. These probably cause variations in sun's energy output (solar constant - Ref - (15).- Movements of sun's poles: Planets make their star wobble, Refs - (17). This is also because of shaker effects, according to my theory (axis of rotation tends to stand upright to plane of shaking). Wobbling of our sun then may cause variations in the direction of sun's radiation (solar wind etc)..- Shaking and wobbling of earth: The same type of dynamic forces, which are the cause of solar activities, are to be expected also in the earth-moon system, as Jose, Refs (02) already suggested,  This means, "shaker effects",  produced by the moon, may cause turbulences in earth's atmosphere, variations in its period of rotation, and in its wobbling of poles. As a result, global circulation systems in the atmosphere and oceans (El Nino etc) will be affected.  6. Areas of ResearchThere are certainly many ways of testing the outlined ideas. I expect, that especially research in following areas will show, whether my theory is tenable or not:6.1  Laboratory Tests"Shaker effects" apparently can be studied in practical laboratory tests. The experiments should show, that my assumptions are correct with regards to the emergence of a differential rotation, and the positioning of the axis of rotation - upright to plane of shaking.6.2 Computer - Simulations"Shaker effects" probably can be studied also in computer simulations.  Preliminary work of the well-known mathematician Riemann may be useful in developing the mathematical models required for such simulations.  Refs (23).6.3 Updating of Jose - StudyUpdating and adjusting of Jose's study, using now available more accurate data, may yield interesting results. His paper, Refs  (02), does not mention, to what extent data of the Inner Planets went into his calculations. The Inner Planets contribute little to sun's overall motion, as shown in  Figure 1. However, they probably have an important impact on sun's rotational motion.Jacques Bouet published a paper in 1984, saying  "A rule-of-thumb relation has been observed between mass and frequency of revolution of satellites, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the mass and frequency of rotation of the planet around which they gravitate." (Ref. 25).  Bouet used the cube of the frequency of revolution of the satellites in his equations. That means, that satellites close to the primary  have a much stronger impact on the rotation of the primary than those on distant orbits. A comparison of planets Mars and Earth may serve as an example: Mars, with two mini-moons very close to their primary, shows about the same period of rotation as Earth, with its massive moon on a distant orbit.Jacques Bouet's "rule-of-thumb" is being supported by an equation, which was  developed more recently by  Samy Esmael (Cairo) - Refs - (26). Both equations might be taken into consideration in updating of Jose's study.6.4 Planetary - ResearchData of Table 2 ( Figure-2 ) suggest, that a correlation exists between the ratio of equatorial velocity to escape velocity (mass) on one hand, and density and ellipticity of planets on the other hand. Planetary researchers may have to look into these data one day. New aspects will come up regarding several astronomical problems, if the indicated correlation exists on a general base.6.5 Solar activitiesThere is, in my view,  following chain of causes and reactions in connection with solar activities:- The curvature of sun's motion (  Figure-1  ) is at times rather circular, not eccentric. There are nor "shaker effects" in such periods. This reduces sun's differential rotation, leading to a sunspot minimum - with some time lag because of the moment of inertia.- Sun's speed of rotation increases during a sunspot minimum, since no mechanical energy is being diverted from sun's rotational motion to the whirling motion of spots during this time.- Sun's diameter blows up to some extent, when its rotation is faster. This reduces sun's mean density, which then causes a variation in the solar constant.- Variations in the solar constant are of influence on our weather and climate on earth.Future research results may support this point of view. Some of the outlined correlations are described already in research reports, for instance - Refs (15) (16) (17) (18) . 6.6 Maunder MinimumFrom about 1645 to 1715 there was a prolonged sunspot minimum (Maunder minimum). It seemingly came along with an anomalous solar rotation, and a period of cooler climate in Europe,  - Ref. (06)(17).The suspected causes for and consequences of sunspot minima are outlined in aforegoing chapter. Sun's motion (Figure-1) must have been rather circular during the Maunder minimum. This should show up, whenJose's study is being updated and extended to the period in question. There would be no transfer of angular momentum, no differential rotation of our sun, and no sunspots at all, if sun was swinging about the centre of mass in a perfect circle. An example of a swinging motion with little eccentricity is offered by planet Saturn   Figure-2 . Saturn shows, as is known, a rather smooth surface.A favourable position of sun's axis of rotation (minimum of wobbling) may have contributed to the prolonged sunspot minimum in the 17th century. Updating of Jose's study might show, whether this is true, and an extension of it into the future might give some warning, when to expect the next "Maunder Minimum" .6.7 The Titius-Bode LawAs has been suggested, planets are possibly arranging themselves in a way, that an optimum of orbit-stability is being achieved (chapter 4). This might be reflected in the Titius-Bode Law.  Computer simulations may show, whether this assumption is correct or not.It may be expected, that re-arrangements of orbits are taking place also in Planet-Moon systems. Especially the Jupiter - moon system may offer opportunities for relevant research, because of Jupiter's erratic motion (Figure 2).6.8 Climate ResearchThere are numerous scientific reports available on suspected or proven correlations between solar activities and climate variations on earth. Many of these reports might gain in plausibility, if investigated under viewpoint of the described chain of causes and reactions (chapter 6.5). Of special interest may be the question, whether it will be possible, to predict the timing of the next  "Maunder Minimum". A prolonged sunspot minimum, coming along with a cooler period, might offset to some extent the much discussed greenhouse effect.6.9 Geophysical ResearchEarth's rotation apparently was faster than at present during earlier periods of our solar system,  Ref. - (24), and its equator then was in a different position. This means, if the assumptions in aforegoing chapters are correct, that- earth's diameter was larger, its shape more elliptical, and its mean density lower than at present, and- moon's revolution period was shorter, moon's orbit at a different angle.Some research reports support this statement to a certain extent. More investigations might be of interest. The periodical growth in coral fossils, for instance, permits conclusions with regards to the number of days per month and per year many million years ago, Ref - (24). One might attempt, to calculate, whether data  of such research are in agreement with the equations given in Ref (25) and (26).</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://edmall.gsfc.nasa.gov/inv99Project.Site/Pages/science-briefs/ed-stickler/sun-earth.html<TEXT>BACKGROUNDThe Sun-Earth Connection program is one of the four principal science themes of NASA's Office of Space Sciences. This program is a partnership between NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center and UC Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory. Numerous ground based observatories and organizations contribute to studying Sun-Earth Connection topics. The mission of the program is to increase science literacy and steward Sun-Earth Connection science resources. While the major focus of the Sun-Earth Connection program is investigating the physical processes that link the Sun and the Earth, the program can be divided into science content areas for educational purposes. (Sun-Earth Connection Program Overview).TEACHERSThis program encompasses a large variety of science topics that cover a broad spectrum of science disciplines. The science content of the entire program matches most completely with Earth & Space Science or Environmental Science courses. Earth & Space Science and Environmental Science teachers could use program information and data to teach Astronomy or Sun-Earth interaction units.Individual portions of the Sun-Earth Connections program are excellent practical examples of Physics and Chemistry topics. Physics and Chemistry teachers could use the Sun-Earth Connection project to provide real life connections and increase student interest in their units on:    * Electromagnetic Radiation    * Energy Transfer    * Atmospheric Chemistry MagnetismThere is a variety of background information and suggested activities currently available on the internet. The Sun-Earth Connections project takes Sun-Earth topics that are currently taught in your classroom and adds current studies on these topics.SCIENCE CONTENT AREAS1.

Atmospheric divisions:Troposphere: surface to 5 or 10 miles high; 95% of total gas in atmosphere at this level. Most weather processes occur in this layer. Temperature drops with increasing altitude.Stratosphere: extends above troposphere to 30 miles. Protective ozone shield occurs in this layer. Temperature remains essentially constant with increasing elevation. III. Solar Radiation and the Atmosphere:Light is electromagnetic radiation which occurs at wavelengths we can perceive (the visable spectrum). However, this radiation can have much lower (radio and infrared radiation) or higher (ultraviolet, x-rays) wavelengths. The bulk of the sun's energy emissions occur from infrared through ultraviolet wavelengths.Solar radation interacts with the atmosphere by:Absorption, in which it is absorbed by the atmosphere or land, increasing its temperature.Reflection, in which it is bounced back into space off of earth or clouds or snow . The amount of radiation reflected off of earth is termed albedo.Scattered, in which it is dispersed by atmospheric molecules in all directions. This creates blue color of sky.The amount of energy absorbed by atmosphere is influenced by the chemicals in the atmosphere. Some atmospheric gasses allow solar energy in visable wavelengths to pass through, while blocking infrared wavelengths. This is important, as most of the energy reflected away from Earth is in the infrared wavelengths. This process allows solar energy to become trapped in the atmosphere, keeping it warm. IV. Variations in solar energy inputsGlobal solar radiation budget:31% reflected or scattered back into space23% absorbed by atmosphere46% absorbed by earth surfaceChanges with altitude: As most of solar energy is absorbed by Earth, air temperature will increase as it gets closer to EarthChanges with location: Because sun is more directly overhead, and becasue the light passess through less atmosphere before striking the Earth, equatorial areas receive more solar radiation than the poles, making them warmer.Changes over time:In summer, northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, making it more overhead, increasing solar radation input.In winter, northern Hemisphere is tilted away from sun, decreasing solar radation input.  V. Global circulation patterns.Weather is created by these differences in solar energy inputs.Here's how it works: Air will rise at the equator as it is warmer thereAir will sink at the poles as it is colder there.The sinking air will create a vacuum, which is replaced by air moving up from the equator. Thus, in a simple world warm and cold air should continually cycle from equator to pole.But, world not simple. For instance, by constantly spinning on its axis, the Earth breaks up this simple convection cell into three smaller ones, with these touching at 30? (latitude of Gulf Coast) and 60o (southern Alaska and Hudson's Bay).At 30? N and at poles, air is sinking from both sides. As cool air holds less water vapor, this air will be dry when it reaches the ground. Most of the deserts on the Earth (Mohave, Sahara, Atacama, Australian, Polar) occur at either 30? N or 30? S or at poles.At equator and 60? N, air is rising from both sides. As this warmer air cools, it creates clouds and precipitation. This is why the equator and boreal forests are wet places.The location of these junctions change over a year, moving poleward in summer, and equator-ward in winter.These cells are responsible for westerly flow of winds in mid-latitudes, and easterly flow of winds in equatorial latitudes V. Climate change.The climate changes over all scales of observation (from days to millions of years)A number of factors can alter the Earth's climate: (1) Intensity of solar emissions(2) Transparency of atmosphere If less energy can pass through air (due to volcanic ash, dust and smoke clouds), the planet will coolIf transparency to infrared changes (from increased CO2, CH4, etc.), the planet will warm (3) Changes in the Earth's orbit. This first proposed by Serbian mathematician Milutin Milankovitch. There are three main ways in which the Earth's orbit changes in relation to the sun: Whether Earth is closest to sun in Northern Hemisphere summer or winter (23,000 year cycle)How tilted the Earth's orbit is on its axis (41,000 year cycle)How eccentric the Earth's Orbit is (100,000 year cycle)Ice ages occur when: Earth is closest to sun in Northern Hemisphere summer, when the tilt is greatest, and when the orbit is most eccentricInterglacials occur when Earth is closest to sun in Northern Hemisphere winter, when tilt is least, and when orbit is most circular.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.icr.org/article/390/<TEXT>In the 1980's and 90's, considerable emphasis has been placed upon climate and environmental issues in the United States. Much air pollution legislation has been put into force. Long-range climate trends have been observed and predicted. Dire scenarios of dramatic warming with attendant droughts and coastal flooding have been predicted. At the same time, devastating displacements of population centers and agricultural consequences due to a possible new "Ice Age" have been presented to the public by other experts.It seems that the scientific establishment and news media have reached a level of hyperactivity, or even paranoia. Why has this recent flurry of concern developed in the environmental sciences? This article will attempt to show that one underlying reason has been the interpretation of climate history by uniformitarian processes over millions of years, rather than by catastrophic processes over thousands of years. An explanation of climatic phenomena by uniformitarian processes requires inherent instabilities in the earth/atmosphere system which are thought to be triggered by small, initial impulses. Fear of triggering such an instability has led to an unreasonable regulation of possible pollutants.THE ASTRONOMICAL THEORYThe current most popular explanation for the "Ice Ages" is based on a refinement of a theory first proposed by Milankovitch.[1] This explanation suggests that the slight changes in orientation and distance from the sun, which the earth experiences in its orbit, result in small variations in heating of the earth's atmosphere. When the heating is reduced, an "Ice Age" occurs, and when it is increased, the excess ice melts and an "interglacial period" results.Figure 1 shows the earth in orbit around the sun. Everyone is familiar with the dramatic changes in heating by the sun as the earth rotates daily on its axis, causing daytime heating and night-time cooling. Not quite as well understood by many is the annual change in seasons as the earth revolves around the sun. Because the earth's axis of rotation is tilted by 23.5 degrees from the normal to the plane of its path around the sun, the northern hemisphere is inclined toward the sun during its summer and away from the sun during its winter. This causes greater heating and warmer temperatures in summer than winter. The southern hemisphere experiences the same effect but is six months out of phase with the northern hemisphere. The period of the earth's rotation on its axis is approximately 24 hours, and the period of Earth's revolution around the sun is approximately one year.Other harmonic variations occur in the orbit of the earth around the sun which are familiar to only a few specialists. The earth experiences a slight wobble as it rotates on its axis. This wobble, caused by the gravitational attraction between a slightly non-spherical Earth and the sun, moon, and planets, has a period of about 20,000 years. By this it is meant that the small, episodic changes measurable today imply a cycle of 20,000 years from maximum to maximum. In addition, the precession of the equinoxes (the migration of the positions of the axes of the elliptic path of the earth around the sun) also has a period of about 20,000 years. The angle of the earth's axial tilt varies between 22 and 24 degrees with a period of about 40,000 years. Another fluctuation is a 100,000 year periodic change in the eccentricity of the annual orbit from circular to elliptic and back again. Each of these small periodic changes, if allowed to experience a full cycle, would cause a small change in heating of the earth's atmosphere.When the periods of these orbital parameters were compared to the fluctuations in ice sheets and sea-floor sediment, thought to have been deposited over millions of years, a correlation was found. Spectral analysis of about a dozen sea-floor sediment cores in the equatorial Pacific Ocean found peaks at 19,000, 23,000, 41,000, and 100,000 years. The first three peaks matched the periods for wobble, precession, and tilt which most strongly affect solar heating. However, the strongest cycle in the sediment record occurred at 100,000 years which corresponds to the period of the eccentricity, the weakest influence on solar heating. Because of this correlation, many paleoclimatologists believe the Astronomical Theory has been proven. Nevertheless, several major weaknesses in the theory remain.PROBLEMS WITH THE ASTRONOMICAL THEORYThe long-period elements of the earth's orbit-wobble, precession, tilt, and eccentricity-influence the solar radiation received, particularly in its geographical distribution. However, the total heating due to solar radiation, integrated over the entire globe annually, only varies significantly with eccentricity. Since the total heating due to eccentricity varies by less than 0.2%, a major task therefore has been to show that this small change in heating (in fact, the smallest periodic fluctuation in solar heating) could lead to cyclic glaciation of the earth on the order of 100,000 years.The climatic state of the earth is not a simple function of total solar heating. It also appears to be dependent on the distribution by latitude. The earth modulates solar heating by reflection, retention, and redistribution of received energy. A complete theory for the interaction of these effects has not been developed.Because confidence is so high in the statistical basis of the Astronomical Theory as an explanation for the "Ice Ages," the problems of a small amount of heating due to changes in eccentricity and a lack of a complete physical explanation for climate change has not led to abandonment of the theory. Instead, an assumed secondary feedback mechanism of some type has been hypothesized for "Ice Age" initiation. In other words, a small cooling pulse due to a periodic decrease in solar heating from changes in the orbital parameters triggers some unknown physical mechanism in the earth-atmosphere system which leads to an "Ice Age."The implication of this approach is that the earth-atmosphere system is inherently unstable, and a small perturbation can create massive changes in the climate. Investigators have attempted to show evidence for past climate instabilities using recent ice core results from the Greenland Ice Core Project (GRIP), but later data from the Greenland Ice Sheet Project (GISP) invalidated this interpretation.[3] [4] Extreme temperature fluctuations before the last "Ice Age" found in the GRIP ice core were not present in the GISP ice core. Evidence for climate instability continues to elude researchers.THE EXISTENCE OF A CLIMATE TRIGGERThe connection between climate and fluctuations in solar heating due to orbital variations is an assumption, not a proven mechanism and has led to the wild speculations seen frequently in both technical and popular literature. If a trigger for "Ice Ages" truly exists in our earth-atmosphere system, then we should obviously be very careful not to do anything which could release the trigger. An inadvertent release of such a trigger could lead to possible chaotic weather conditions, flooding, and drought. Under such conditions we should obviously restrict the release of pollutants into the atmosphere like smokes and particulates which are known to produce cooling. However, the assumption of a trigger does not necessarily mean that one exists. In fact, much evidence suggests that the atmosphere is a very stable system,[5] and catastrophic events are required to cause climatic changes as massive as an "Ice Age."I believe the assumption of a trigger is the result of unjustified confidence in the Astronomical Theory which, in turn, is based on uniformitarian processes over millions of years. The current research which is being conducted at ICR [6] is beginning to demonstrate that the events of the Genesis Flood would naturally produce an "Ice Age." The residual heat remaining in the oceans after the Flood would release tremendous quantities of moisture and fall as snow in the polar regions and on mountains for several hundred years after the Flood. If ice sheets and layers of sea-floor sediments were not laid down slowly over long periods of time, but rapidly over the last few thousand years following the global Flood described in Genesis, then the Astronomical Theory is completely wrong. If the Astronomical Theory is wrong, there is no need for a trigger, and the concern for a fragile, unstable atmosphere which can suddenly revert to a new "Ice Age" is unjustified. </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://earthsci.org/processes/weather/fundam/fundam.html<TEXT>TemperatureAs shown in the relationship at left, temperature is related to the motion of molecules. Molecules in a gas travel faster at higher temperature. Relationships like the one above define temperature on the Kelvin (K) scale. At a temperature of 0 K there is no molecular motion and temperatures less than 0 K are undefined. The Kelvin scale must be used when calculating with equations like the one above.The Fahrenheit scale (F) was devised in 1753. On this scale at 1 atmosphere pressure, pure water melts from ice at 32 F and boils at 212F.The Celsius scale (C) was devised in 1850 as part of the metric system. At 1 atmosphere pressure pure water melts from ice at 0 C and boils at 100 C. The Celsius scale is preferred for scientific measurement and is used to report air temperature in most of the world -- except USA. Centigrade is an obsolete name for the Celsius scale.The Celsius and Kelvin scales use the same size degree. A change of 1 C is the same as a change of 1 K. 0 C is the same temperature as 273.15 K.Conversion between F and o C is complicated by the fact that the scales differ both in degree size and in the zero point. On neither of these scales does it make much sense to say 60 o is twice as hot as 30  . (The two scales give the same reading at - 40  .)HeatHeat is a form of energy. The amount of heat depends on mass, on temperature, and on the nature of the substance involved.# A 1-liter jar of water at 20  C contains the same amount of heat as another 1-liter jar of water at 20  C# A 2-liter jar of water at 20  C contains twice as much heat as a 1-liter jar of water at 20  C# A 1-liter jar of water at 20  C contains over 1000 times more heat than a 1-liter jar of dry air at 20  C. 1 liter of water has a mass of 1,000g while 1 liter of dry air has a mass of 1.2g.# A 1-liter jar of water at 40  C does not contain twice as much heat as a 1-liter jar of water at 20  C. 1 cal of heat is needed to warm 1g of water by 1  C. This is called water's specific heat. 20,000cal are needed to warm 1 liter (1,000g) of water by 20  C.1 liter of water at 0  C contains 136,500cal of heat -- not 0 cal. (The notes do not show you how to calculate this number.) 1 liter of water at 20  C thus contains 156,500cal and 1 liter of water at 40  C con-tains 176,500cal.top...Specific heats for various substances are given below: ( cal / g  C )  Liquid water has an unusually high specific heat. (This has a number of consequences in discussing weather. For now, just keep this in mind.)Latent HeatHeat 1 liter of water. For every 1,000cal of heat absorbed the temperature rises by 1  C. But when the temperature reaches 100  C the temperature stops rising even though more heat is applied. Each 540 cal of heat absorbed by liquid water at 100  C produces 1g of steam at 100  C. The 540 cal/g is called the heat of vaporization because it goes into converting liquid to vapor rather than raising the temperature.top...# The 540 cal/g is not lost. It is returned in exact amount when the steam condenses back to water at 100  C. This is an example of latent heat.Much latent heat is used to evaporate water in the tropics and released when the vapor is carried towards the poles and re-precipitated. This allows large amounts of heat to be moved very efficiently. # Liquid water can be converted to vapor at any temperature; it does not have to be heated to 100  C. At 0  C 595 cal/g will convert liquid water to vapor at 0  C.#   80 cal/g of heat, called the (latent) heat of fusion is involved in the conversion between ice and liquid water. The heat is absorbed to melt the ice and recovered when the water freezes.Heat TransferHeat can be transferred by conduction, by convection, and by radiation. The heat always moves from high temperature towards lower temperature.ConductionIn conduction vibration or thermal motion of molecules in a hot region is transferred to nearby molecules in a cooler region. There is no bulk movement of material.Materials which favor this process -- including most metals -- are good conductors. Materials which retard conduction of heat are called insulators. Rock, soil, glass, and most ceramics are good insulators. Dry air -- confined so that it doesn't flow -- is an excellent insulator.A thin layer of air is heated or cooled by conduction in contact with the ground.ConvectionMaterials expand and lose density when heated. A heated fluid (liquid or gas) becomes less dense and can rise upwards, displacing cooler fluid which then sinks. This vertical motion carrying heat is called convection. If the motion is mostly horizontal the transfer is called advection. Both processes are very important in the atmosphere.RadiationObjects can be heated by absorbing electromagnetic waves and they can be cooled by emitting electromagnetic waves. Either process is called radiation. Radiation is the only process that can move heat across empty Space.Earth's surface and atmosphere are heated by radiation from the Sun. Earth's surface and atmosphere also radiate heat back into Space -- maintaining an equilibrium temperature.A hot body radiates energy (E) much more efficiently than a cooler body. Ideally the relationship is given by the Stefan-Boltzman Law: As Earth warms from solar heating it radiates heat back into space more efficiently. Eventually it radiates back as much energy as it receives and the temperature stops changing. The figure at right shows that a heated object radiates energy (E) across a broad spectrum of wavelengths ( lambda). Emission drops sharply towards the short wavelengths but spreads broadly through the longer wavelengths. A simple equation called Wien's Law describes the position of lambda max , the wavelength at which the most energy is radiatedAs shown by Wien's Law, a hot body radiates energy at shorter wavelengths than does a cooler body. This can be very important.Earth's atmosphere is transparent to the short waves that transmit the majority of the Sun's energy. These rays strike and warm the ground surface. The heated ground radiates energy back into Space, but at longer wavelengths because the ground is much cooler than the Sun. These longer, infrared rays are absorbed by H 2 O, CO 2 , and CH 4 in the atmosphere. This greenhouse effect warms the atmosphere by about 33  C (60  F).Heat SourcesAs indicated by volcanoes, etc., Earth is hot inside. Some of this heat leaks out through the surface and is available for heating the atmosphere. This leakage of heat from inside the Earth amounts to 0.0143 cal through a square meter each second. If it were the only source of heat, Earth's surface would have a temperature about -440 o F.Put a 1 square meter solar panel in orbit above Earth's atmosphere and face it squarely towards the Sun. Each second it will intercept 327 cal of heat (22,000 times more than the heat from leakage of Earth's internal heat). Conclusion: Earth's surface and atmosphere are heated by the Sun.top...(Earth's internal heat does have one effect on weather. Because heat always flows from hot towards cold, the solar heat penetrates only a few feet inside the Earth.)Daily Temperature CycleConsider the Earth's surface on a calm, clear day. On this day the Sun rises at 6AM (6h), peaks at Noon (12h), and sets at 6PM (18h).As shown by the heavy dashed, solar heating curve, the Sun immediately begins heating the surface. The greatest amount of solar heat is delivered at noon and the amount declines during the afternoon. After the Sun sets, no heat is delivered until the next dawn.Not surprisingly, the surface temperature rises immediately but note that the highest temperature occurs sometime in mid-afternoon rather than at Noon when the solar heating is most intense. Why?According to the Stefan-Boltzman Lawthe surface radiates energy to space as long as it has a temperature above 0 o K ( - 460  F). As heat radiates away at night the surface cools steadily becoming coolest just at dawn. This is shown by the light-dashed, radiation loss curve. The energy for this radiation comes from heat stored in the surface rock, soil, and water and in the air.The heat that was "borrowed" overnight is "repaid" next morning. The shaded area between the two radiation curves represents solar heat that is going back into storage rather than heating the surface. Sometime in the afternoon as the solar heating declines, the heating and radiation-loss curves become equal. This marks the moment of highest surface temperature. For the rest of the day and night temperature must drop as stored energy is tapped.The figure at right shows how the daily solar heating cycle affects the air in clear weather with little wind.Dry air cools 10  C as it rises 1000m; this is called the dry adiabatic lapse rate. Note also that still air is a good insulator -- a poor conductor of heat.By day the ground surface absorbs solar radiation. Rock and soil are good insulators so the heat stays very close to the surface and the temperature rises. Very slowly this heat is conducted into the air near the ground but the higher air is only slightly warmed (temperature profile on right, above).On a calm, clear night the ground cools by radiating heat back into Space. The air near the cold ground cools slowly by conduction but the higher air cools only slightly. Eventually this can produce an inversion -- a region where temperature increases with altitude (profile on left, above).top...Latitude and LongitudeA meridian is a circle on the Earth that passes through both poles and any third point of your choice. Latitude is measured along any meridian as shown at right. The Equator is a circle drawn at right angles to the meridians at Latitude 0 o . Longitude is measured around the Equator west and east from a Prime Meridian ( = Greenwich Meridian) passing through London England.NU Husky Statue lat 42.3410 0.0005  N long 71.089  WDeclination  Earth's Equator can be projected outwards to make a Celestial Equator. Declination is a measure of angular distance of celestial objects north or south of the Celestial Equator. Each star has a fixed, constant declination. During the course of each year, the Sun's declination varies between +23.4   (N) to -23.4   (S). These extremes of declination mark the two Solstices. In-between are two Equinoxes when the Sun crosses the Celestial Equator. These four positions of the Sun mark the beginning of the Astronomical Seasons. They can be calculated precisely. In 1999 the Sun crossed the Vernal Equinox (Spring begins) on 20 March at 8:46PM EST.The Seasons Earth's orbit is slightly elliptical. At perihelion (closest to Sun) the distance from Earth to Sun is 147,000,000km. At aphelion (furthest from Sun) the distance is 152,000,000km. The difference is enough to change temperature on earth by up to 7 o FBut note that Earth is at perihelion each year on 3 January and at aphelion about 4 July. Evidently distance to the Sun is not what causes Earth's seasons.If Earth's axis of daily rotation were perpendicular to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, then every place would have 12 hours of sunlight each day of the year. It would be cool at the poles and warm at the Equator but there would be no seasonal change during the year.top...Earth's axis of daily rotation is tipped 23.4 o from perpendicular to the plane of our orbit around the Sun. This is the underlying cause of the seasonal changes in our weather. It causes the Sun's declination (see box above) to change from +23.4   at the June Solstice to - 23.4   at the December Solstice with values of 0   at the two equinoxes.On flat ground two factors affect the amount of solar heating:1) the number of hours of sunlight, and2) the Sun's elevation -- its height in degrees measured up from the horizon -- especially its elevation at noontime.top...Both change at different latitudes on Earth and both change as the Sun's declination changes during the year. Both can be calculated with the equation belowResults of such calculation are shown in the table. The rows show five latitudes from the Equator to the North Pole. The columns show five positions of the Sun from the June Solstice to the December Solstice. Each square shows the calculated hours of sunlight (top), the noon elevation of the Sun (middle), and the relative amount of solar heating (bottom).Equator (lat. 0   )The noon sun is straight overhead at the two equinoxes and is high in the sky all year -- this promotes strong heating but each day of the year gets the same 12 hours of sunlight. During a year the amount of heating varies by only about 10%. There may be a wet season and a dry season but there is little variation in temperature during a year. In fact, the difference in day and night temperature is greater than the seasonal variation.Tropic of Cancer (lat. 23.4  )The noon Sun is straight overhead on the day of the June Solstice and as low as 43 o at the December Solstice. The longest day is only 1 1/2 hours longer than 12 hours and the shortest day only 1 1/2 hours less. The warmest day gets almost twice the heating of the coolest day but this is not a large variation. This is still a hot climate; heat for the whole year is only 10% less than at the Equator. Going south towards the Equator the seasonal variation is even less.Latitude 45  top...(Boston at lat. 42   N has seasons like this.) The seasonal variation is pronounced.The longest day is twice as long as the shortest day. On the longest day the noon sun delivers twice as much heat as on the shortest day. The combined effect is a 4x variation in daily solar heating over the year. During the warmest three months this latitude is heated more than the Equator at the same time. Over a year this latitude gets 75% as much heat as the Equator.Arctic Circle (lat. 67 o )On 21 June this latitude gets 24 hours of daylight (but then there is 21 December when the Sun fails to rise at all). During June the Sun is low in the northern sky most of the night and on the 21st it doesn't set -- grazing the horizon due north at midnight. At noon on the 21st of June the Sun is 47   above the southern horizon (about the same as Boston in late March). The long hours of daylight in Summer add up and during the warmest three months this latitude gets about 90% as much heat as the Equator. (But watch out for the coldest three months.) Over the course of a year this latitude gets about half as much solar heating as the Equator.Going north there are more days getting 24 hours of Summer daylight (balanced by the same number of Winter days with no Sun).North Pole (lat. 90  N)top...In mid-March the Sun pokes above the horizon and circles 360   each day. Each day the Sun is slightly higher until on 21 June it circles 360   at 23   above the horizon. Note that the Sun doesn't rise and set each day -- it just circles at a constant elevation. In late September the Sun sinks below the horizon. At best, on 21 June the noon Sun is only 24   above the horizon (about the same as Boston in late December). That's a weak angle for solar heating but the long working hours make up and for a few weeks there is more heating here than at the Equator! But watch out for the long winters.(At low Sun angles, less than about 15   , the light must travel long distances through the lower atmosphere with the possibility of heat being absorbed or reflected by clouds and haze. The actual heating of the Arctic ground is accordingly somewhat less than the results calculated above.)Global EffectsYear-round the tropics maintain an average monthly temperature (see below) around 80   F.In Summer the entire northern hemisphere is strongly heated by the Sun and even the high Arctic reaches an average July temperature of 40  . The temperature gradient (drop) from Equator to North Pole is only 40  F and the isotherms are broadly spaced.In Winter the northern hemisphere receives little to no solar heating. January mean temperature at the North Pole drops to -30 to -40  F (-50  F in Siberia). The temperature gradient from Equator to North Pole is very steep and the isotherms are closely spaced.In the next Chapter we will see that these global temperature gradients are directly related to global wind circulation.Solar heating varies with latitude and the temperature isotherms in the main follow the parallels of latitude. Where they deviate, they do so because of# land vs water (The oceans heat or cool slowly)# ocean currents# elevationThe 60% of Earth's surface from 37  N through the Equator and down to 37  S receives a surplus of Solar heating. The 40% of the surface lying closer to the poles experiences a deficit. To keep long term temperatures stable, there must be an efficient transfer of heat from the regions with surplus heat to the regions with deficit. This global heat transfer is the cause of most of our weather. The work is divided about evenly between:# advection, the lateral movement of warm or cool air masses# the absorption of latent heat as water evaporates in the tropics and its release as the water precipitates in cooler regions# warm and cold ocean currents transfer much heat because of water's high specific heat.Temperature Statistics For each 24-hour day the maximum and minimum temperatures are measured to the nearest degree and recorded.The daily average is the arithmetic mean (average) of the daily maximum and minimum. The number is rounded down to the nearest integer (75.5 is recorded as 75   ).The monthly average is the arithmetic mean of the daily averages.The yearly average is the arithmetic mean of the twelve monthly averages.Normal is defined as the average of a reading over the past 30 years.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/whysolar.shtml<TEXT>The Climate ConnectionThe Sun is a source of light and heat for life on Earth. Our ancestors realized that their lives depended upon the Sun and they held the Sun in reverent awe. We still recognize the importance of the Sun and find the Sun to be awe inspiring. In addition we seek to understand how it works, why it changes, and how these changes influence us here on planet Earth. The Sun was much dimmer in its youth and yet the Earth was not frozen. The quantity and quality of light from the Sun varies on time scales from milliseconds to billions of years. During recent sunspot cycles the total solar irradiance has changed by about 0.1% with the sun being brighter at sunspot maximum. Some of these variations most certainly affect our climate but in uncertain ways.Click on image for larger version.Space WeatherThe Sun is the source of the solar wind; a flow of gases from the Sun that streams past the Earth at speeds of more than 500 km per second (a million miles per hour). Disturbances in the solar wind shake the Earth's magnetic field and pump energy into the radiation belts. Regions on the surface of the Sun often flare and give off ultraviolet light and x-rays that heat up the Earth's upper atmosphere. This "Space Weather" can change the orbits of satellites and shorten mission lifetimes. The excess radiation can physically damage satellites and pose a threat to astronauts. Shaking the Earth's magnetic field can also cause current surges in power lines that destroy equipment and knock out power over large areas. As we become more dependent upon satellites in space we will increasingly feel the effects of space weather and need to predict it.The Sun as a StarThe Sun also serves an important role in helping us to understand the rest of the astronomical universe. It is the only star close enough to us to reveal details about its surface. Without the Sun we would not have easily guessed that other stars also have spots and hot outer atmospheres. The Sun is the key to understanding other stars. We know the Sun's age, radius, mass, and luminosity (brightness) and we have also learned detailed information about its interior and atmosphere. This information is crucial for our understanding of other stars and how they evolve. Many physical processes that occur elsewhere in the universe can be examined in detail on the Sun. In this way solar astronomy teaches us much about stars, planetary systems, galaxies, and the universe itself.The Sun as a Physical LaboratoryThe Sun produces its energy by nuclear fusion - four hydrogen nuclei are fused to form single helium nuclei deep within the Sun's core. We have worked for decades to reproduce this process (in a controlled manner) here on Earth. Most of these efforts involve extremely hot plasmas  in strong magnetic fields. (This plasma is not the blood product but rather a mixture of ions and electrons produced at high temperatures.) Much of solar astronomy involves observing and understanding plasmas under similar conditions. There continues to be much interaction between solar astronomers and scientific researchers in this and many other areas.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.uwgb.edu/DutchS/pseudosc/flipaxis.htm<TEXT>Conservation of MomentumThe idea of the Earth's orbit or rotation being disturbed is a common catastrophe theme, exploited in movies such as The Day the Earth Caught Fire, not to mention the theories of Velikovsky. In The Day the Earth Caught Fire, nuclear explosions send Earth spiraling toward the Sun, and only a last-ditch counter-explosion saves the world. The movie features one of the best scripts of any science-fiction film, but the story line is impossible. Unless mass were expelled from the Earth, or some force were applied from outside the Earth, it would be impossible to change the Earth's orbit or rotation. To see this, sit in a swivel chair equipped with casters. Now, without touching the floor or anything outside the chair, try to get the chair rotating. Try to move it across the floor. Its just about impossible (that you can do it at all is due to a small amount of friction between the chair and the floor.) The principle here is called conservation of momentum. While in the chair, you are an isolated system. You had zero rotational momentum to begin with, and zero linear momentum, and regardless of what you do, zero they stay. What little motion you impart to the chair results from there being some friction in the casters and swivel, so that you do interact very slightly with the floor. An astronaut floating free in space without a safety line or propulsion would be utterly helpless to reach safety even a few feet away. He would have no way to acquire momentum. Nothing acting solely from on or within the Earth could change its orbit or seriously alter its rotation.The operative word there is "seriously." Internal processes can and do affect the earth's rotation slightly.Planets are Pretty BigOne way to move an object is to throw mass in the opposite direction, the way jets or rockets do. The mass and the object move in opposite directions, but the center of mass of the whole system at each instant tends to stay fixed. If our astronaut had a wrench he could throw it and move himself. He might also vent off some excess oxygen to propel himself. But expelling enough mass to affect the gigantic bulk of the Earth is a stupendous task. No nuclear blast from any bomb now in existence would blast material free of the earth at all. The largest spacecraft have far less effect on the Earth than a flea jumping off an elephant. If we think really big and imagine blasting a chunk out of the Earth as big as North America and 100 miles thick so that its final speed, after escape, with respect to the Earth is 25,000 miles an hour, we will have expelled only 1/500 of the total mass of the Earth. The Earth would move in the opposite direction 1/500 as fast or 50 miles an hour. The speed of the Earth in its orbit is about 67,000 miles an hour. We will not change the orbit of the Earth very much--if we apply the impulse to speed up the earth in its orbit we would put the Earth into a new orbit with its most distant point about 70,000 miles further from the Sun than now--and the Earth's distance from the Sun varies now by three million miles over the course of a year! Exactly the same arguments apply to changing the orbit of the Earth through the impact of a large asteroid. The largest asteroid, Ceres, about 600 miles in diameter, is only about as massive as our hypothetical chunk of Earth above. Changing the orbit of a planet is a tall order. An impact big enough to have even a tiny effect on the Earth's orbit or rotation would almost certainly destroy all life on Earth as well.Can the Earth's Axis Flip?Yet another common catastrophist theme has to do with causing the Earth's axis to shift somehow. When I mention continental drift to non-scientists, I often am asked if having the continents all together as they were 200 million years ago might have unbalanced the Earth. Surprisingly, the Earth's continents are closely bunched now. If you look down on Paris on a globe, you will see a hemisphere containing most of the Earth's land. If you look down on the opposite point on the globe (southeast of New Zealand), you will see a hemisphere almost entirely covered by ocean. The Earth is very asymmetrical, but a second surprising point is that the distribution of continents and oceans has almost no effect on the balance of the Earth. First of all, the crust is only 1/300 of the Earth's mass, and second, recall that the crust 'floats' on the plastic mantle. Continental crust is thick and high, but it's light. Oceanic crust is thin and low, but it's dense. This buoyant effect, called isostasy, in effect makes the Earth self-balancing. The plasticity of the Earth's interior has another important side effect. The centrifugal force resulting from the Earth's rotation causes the Earth to bulge at the Equator by about 14 miles. Changing the rotation of a sphere is hard, changing the rotation of an ellipsoid like the Earth is harder yet. The Earth has a lot of extra mass where it counts most. Finally, recall your attempt to get your swivel chair rotating; the Earth cannot cause its own rotation to change significantly.Some people think of the Earth's axis "flipping over," like a top falling on its side or perhaps like one of the novelty tops that spontaneously flips over. But tops change their motion because they are balanced on a firm surface and because gravity is pulling them downward. Under zero gravity conditions, like in a spacecraft, both types of tops would spin until they slowed due to air resistance. In space, with no air, they would spin forever, and not flip or fall over. The Earth is spinning like a top, but like one spinning in space.The amount of energy contained in the earth's rotation is pretty large: 2.1 x 1029 joules. You'd have to supply an appreciable fraction of that to change the earth's rotation in any major way. To put this number in perspective, a megaton is 4 x 1015 joules. You'd have to supply about 5 x 1014  megatons, or about 100 million times the total nuclear arsenal of the Earth. So we can see that the science fiction theme of a nuclear blast affecting the earth's rotation is just plain impossible. The kinetic energy of the earth in its orbit is about 2.7 x 1033 joules or about 10,000 times its rotational energy, so the entire earth's nuclear arsenal could hardly affect the earth in its orbit even if we could somehow deliver the energy effectively.Another way to look at this is that it takes 400,000 joules to melt a kilogram of rock, so to change the earth's rotation, you'd liberate enough energy to melt 5 x 1023 kilograms of rock or almost 10 per cent of the earth.Some Examples in Popular LiteratureCatastrophes of this sort crop up in the strangest places. David Graham's novel Down to a Sunless Sea starts out as a fairly engrossing story of transoceanic airliners trying to reach safety in the midst of a nuclear war. To escape fallout, which is worst in the Northern Hemisphere, two airliners head for Antarctica. So far so good, from a literary standpoint, that is. But after the planes reach McMurdo Station, Graham introduces a preposterous deus ex machina ending; one of the scientist passengers discovers that the nuclear bombardment has tilted the Earth's axis and Antarctica will eventually end up astride the equator!Now hold it a minute. Apart from the inability of nuclear weapons to affect the Earth's rotation, there's a fatal flaw in the story. The reason for going to Antarctica is to escape fallout, which is being spread by the wind, but the Earth's wind belts are governed by the Earth's rotation. If the Earth's rotation changes, any guarantees Antarctica may have enjoyed against fallout become null and void. Graham's characters don't even get the inclination of the Earth's axis right. "About nineteen degrees?" asks one. "Nineteen and a half" corrects the "expert." The actual value is 23 1/2 degrees. All in all, it's about as amateurish a way to end a story as concluding with "then I fell out of bed and woke up."Charles Berlitz, best known for his books on the Bermuda Triangle, also branched out into catastrophes with a 1981 book entitled Doomsday 1999 A.D., a tour de force that combined many favorite catastrophist themes. One of his arguments is that the concentration of ice near the South Pole could cause the Earth to wobble. He advocates getting rid of the ice by melting it (perhaps anticipating the global warming debate?). All the arguments against changing the Earth's rotation that apply to the continents apply in spades here. The Antarctic ice cap is only 1/100,000 of the Earth's mass, and isostasy has balanced the load of the ice by causing the crust to sink--slowly. The plastic mantle had ample time to flow out of the way. Finally, if you want to balance or unbalance a wheel, where do you put the weight--on the axle or on the rim? The Earth's rotation axis passes through the poles, and a massive ice cap near the poles can hardly affect the Earth's rotation. And because of its equatorial bulge, the Earth does have a lot of extra mass where it does count for stability.Wandering Poles ?Apparent Polar WanderOne scientific term that has added to public confusion on this point is "wandering poles." When rocks cool from the molten state, magnetic minerals in them become magnetized by the Earth's magnetic field. If the rocks have not been too badly disturbed we can figure out where the magnetic pole was when the rocks formed. The north magnetic pole is now in northern Canada, the southern in Antarctica, both about a thousand miles from the geographic poles. If we plot the apparent location of the magnetic poles through geologic time as seen from any given continent, the poles appear to have wandered widely across the Earth. In the days before continental drift became accepted, some scientists thought that the magnetic poles actually had moved, but we now believe, on both theoretical and observational grounds, that the magnetic poles are always close to the geographic poles. Most planets that are known to have magnetic fields have their magnetic axes close to their rotation axes. Geologists are now convinced that the continents, rather than the poles, have wandered, and the accepted term now for the apparent motion of the magnetic poles is "apparent polar wander."True Polar WanderIn addition to apparent polar wander, however, there is a real polar wander. The crust of the earth can slide over its plastic interior in response to mass imbalances. The rotation axis of the Earth stays fixed, but the crust as a whole can move relative to the poles. The term is still a misnomer - it's the crust that moves, not the poles.How Planets' Rotations Can ChangeImpactSimulations of the evolution of the early solar system don't end up with nine large regularly-spaced planets. Instead, they end up with hundreds of small planets that merge by collision, and collisions between similar-sized planets could certainly radically change their rotations. Some planetary geologists have suggested the slow rotation of Venus and the extreme axial tilt of Uranus may have resulted from early collisions.Rotating objects have momentum, called angular momentum. For the Earth, that amounts to about 5.9 x 1033 kg-m2/sec. Now imagine an asteroid hitting the earth a grazing blow right on the equator. That would be the most effective way an asteroid could change the earth's rotation, either speeding it up or slowing it down. The asteroid has angular momentum relative to the center of the earth, equal to its mass times its velocity times the distance to the center of the earth. Typical impacts in the inner solar system involve velocities of about 30 kilometers per second, and for a grazing impact the distance from the center of the earth will be 6400 kilometers. In meters, those figures are 30,000 and 6,400,000, respectively. So to have angular momentum comparable to earth's we have mass x 30,000 x 6,400,000 = 5.9 x 1033, or mass = 3 x 1022 kilograms. Since the earth itself has a mass of 6 x 1024 kilograms, we're talking about something with 5 per cent of the mass of the earth, or about 4.5 times the mass of the moon. This is way bigger than any known asteroid.How would this affect the earth? The asteroid has kinetic energy = 1/2(mass)(velocity)2. =  1.3 x 1031 joules. Let's assume the asteroid stops the earth's rotation cold. That means that 2.1 x 1029 joules of its energy goes into stopping the earth's rotation, leaving about 98 per cent expressed in other forms, like heat. It takes 400,000 joules to melt a kilogram of rock, so there's enough energy left over to melt 3 x 1025 kilograms of rock. That's about five times the mass of the earth. Even allowing for a lot of energy radiating to space or being blasted off as ejecta, this puppy will melt most if not all of the earth. So don't sweat the long-term environmental effects. If the earth is ever hit hard enough to affect its rotation, nobody will be around to tell about it. On the other hand, an asteroid 10 kilometers in diameter, comparable to the one that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, would have a mass of 1.5 x 1015 kilograms. If it hit the earth a grazing blow on the equator, its angular momentum would be 1.5 x 1015 x 30,000 x 6,400,000 = 3 x 1026 kg-m2/sec. That's about 1/20,000,000 of the earth's angular momentum, meaning it could change the earth's rotation by about 1/20,000,000, or change the length of the day by about .004 seconds. This is pretty tiny, but still several thousand times the effect of the great 2004 Indonesian earthquake. Even an impact big enough to cause a global catastrophe would still have only a tiny effect on the earth's rotation.PrecessionNothing could seem simpler than a spinning top or a revolving wheel, but the rotation of real objects is a remarkably complex business. If objects are not perfectly symmetrical around their rotation axis, they naturally wobble around their rotation axis. The Earth, which is not perfectly spherical, wobbles observably. Even movements of weather systems modify the wobbles.Forces from outside can affect the rotation of planets. We have already discussed impact, which could not have a serious effect on the Earth's rotation barring something big enough to extinguish all life on Earth. Another process is precession - a rotating object's axis oscillates if a sideways force is applied to it. The Earth's axis precesses over a period of 26,000 years because of the attraction of the Sun and Moon and, to a lesser extent, the planets. Superimposed on the Earth's normal precession is a slow oscillation of the Earth's axial tilt over a period of 41,000 years. Right now the tilt is decreasing. The tropics are moving toward the equator at about 15 meters a year. Actually, it's not the axis that changes in tilt but the plane of the earth's orbit.The Moon actually acts to keep the earth's axis tilt within moderate limits. Planets like Mars that lack moons can precess greatly due to the gravitational pull of other planets. Some planetary geologists believe precession has played a role in changing the climate of Mars, but precession is slow.Tidal BrakingAnother process that can change the rotation of a planet is tidal braking. Tides create friction, and this friction can slow the rotation of a planet. Lest anyone think this is a possible way to accomplish some of Velikovsky's catastrophes, it is not. A close brush with Venus or Mars would not last long enough nor generate enough friction to stop the Earth and re-start it as Velikovsky claims happened. Nevertheless, the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth, and Mercury's rotation is locked to its revolution around the Sun because of tidal braking. Perhaps most spectacular, tidal stresses in Jupiter's innermost moon, Io, probably generate enough heat through friction to keep Io's interior hot and cause it to be volcanically active. Tidal braking of the Earth by the Moon has slowed the Earth's rotation from 400 revolutions per year to the present 365 over the last half-billion years. Neither tidal braking nor precession, however, can be used to explain the sorts of catastrophes that pseudoscientists insist happened.Enter Chaos TheoryIt's only a matter of time before catastrophists point to chaos theory to show that orbits can wander all over the place. In it's simplest terms, a system is chaotic if a tiny difference in conditions at one time amplifies to huge differences later on. Almost any complex system is chaotic. What chaos means is that you can't predict the behavior of systems accurately in the very long term. We will probably never be able to predict weather in detail a year in advance. Chaos does not mean systems have no limits or are unstable. Weather is chaotic because tiny variations in local conditions eventually cause predictions to become unreliable, but that does not mean we are likely to see temperatures of +200 or -200 degrees or that it will snow in July in Florida.The Solar System is chaotic. Tiny inaccuracies in measurements of the planets now would add up to very large differences in a million years. We cannot say with any accuracy where the planets were in the sky 100 million years ago. And in the very long term planets can modify each others' orbits. The discovery of extra-solar planets has led to a lot of fresh discoveries about orbital evolution. Solar Systems with lots of giant planets like Jupiter or bigger either fling planets out of the solar system, merge them in collisions, or, if they're lucky, settle down into stable orbits. In our solar system, Jupiter is a stabilizing influence. It keeps the other planets nearly in the same orbital plane and keeps orbits from getting too eccentric. Many planetary scientists argue that life on Earth requires a planet like Jupiter to maintain stability and sweep up potential impacting objects. Morals:    * Scientists are perfectly willing to believe in changes in orbit, axial tilt, planetary collisions, and so on, provided there is evidence for them.     * The Solar System is chaotic (not exactly predictable on a very long time scale) but not wildly unstable. There's not a shred of evidence for gross changes in historic times.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~blackman/ast104/seasons.htm<TEXT>The Spin Axis of the Earth and importance of its 23.5 degree tiltThe Earth rotates along the plane of the equator, meaning that the Earth spins in a circle represented by the equator, or any latitude line, for that matter. (It precesses a little with respect to its orbit plane, once every 26,000 years at a time. More on this later.) If you stood out in space so that you could look down over the North Pole, you would notice that the Earth spins counterclockwise, which makes sense if you consider that the sun rises in the East and sets in the West.The figures show the suns rays as they impinge on the Earth.North Polar and Equatorial views of Earth and Solar BeamsEarth's axis tilt and equatorial plane compared with its plane of orbit      The basic reason for the seasons is: Because the plane of the ecliptic (the plane of the Sun's apparent path on the sky) is titled with respect to the celestial equator (the plane perpendicular to the earths spin axis), the respective hemispheres receive more direct or less direct sunlight at different times in the earths orbit around the Sun. This is easy to see in a picture.      In the northern hemisphere note that the sun in the summer solstice rises in the northeast, moves high across the sky and settles in the northwest.      In the northern hemisphere in the winter solstice the sun rises in southeast, scoots low across the sky and sets in the south west.      There are two important issues here:    * Summer sun is above horizon for more hours a day than for winter sun. Summer days are long and winter days are short Thus we receive more energy per day.    * Summer sunlight is more direct. More energy per unit area is received by sun. Thing of the longer shadows cast in winter. Also think of the beam of a flashlight illuminating a spot on a table: Direct illumination provides maximum light per unit area. Tilting the flashlight means that the beam is spread over more area but its is giving of the same energy per unit time. Thus the energy per unit time per area is smaller in the tilted case, and similarly as applies to the sun in the winter. More on the SeasonsEquinox    * A time at which the days and nights are the same length around the world.    * Occurs around March 21 and September 21 (but not necessarily on those dates).    * Occurs when the Sun is directly over the equator.      The vernal equinox marks the beginning of the spring, when the Sun passes northward through the equatorial plane (Mar 21)      The autumnal equinox marks the beginning of fall, when the Sun passes southward through the equatorial plane (Sept 21)Solstice    * A time at which either day or night is the longest it will be during the year.    * Occurs around June 21 and December 20 (but not necessarily on those dates).    * Called simply summer or winter solstice and mark the beginning of those seasons.    * Occurs when the sun is directly above 23.5 N latitude (Summer Solstice) or 23.5 S latitude (Winter Solstice).    * Will allow one pole to have 24 hours of daylight, while the other pole has a 24 hour night. Note that the temperature does not become warm immediately after spring begins. This is because the ground and water are still cool from winter and take time to heat up. Same is true in reverse at the beginning of winter--the surface of the Earth takes time to cool.KEY POINT: The seasons are not the result of a changing Earth-sun distance. The distance actually does vary a little, and the orbit is slightly elliptical but this is a small effect. Note that the closest approach between objects in an orbit is called the perihelion and the farthest point is the aphelion.The aphelion occurs around July 4 and the perihelion occurs around January 4. Clearly this has very little to do with the seasons.PrecessionThe Earth's spin axis precesses (= wobbles) with a period of 26,000 years due to the fact that the Earth is not completely spherical. It has a bulge. Without getting into details, the sun and the moon pull on this bulge (tidal torques) and the net effect is to try to twist the earth upright during its orbit. The result is the conical precession.The effect is very small on day to day, and we don't notice it in our lifetime. However, since the celestial poles and equator are defined with respect to thisThe signs of the Zodiac represent the constellations that lie in the plane of the ecliptic. If we could turn off the sun in its fixed position, then the constellation behind it determines the particular Zodiac "sign" of that time of year.But because of the precession, the original system developed by the Babylonians 2000 years ago is now outdated, though it is still the common one that is used in popular culture and by astrology types.For example Aries, which represented the sign of the spring equinox then, is not longer an equinox sign. Now it is Aquarius ("the age of Aquarius").Astronomical Effects on Earth's Climate?There were some effects I briefly mentioned that I said were small: the precession of Earth's spin axis, the slight ellipticity of the Earth's orbit. Is there any sense in which these effects are important? Possibly:CLIMATE describes the average weather over decades and centuries. (Weather is what happens on a day to day basis.) It is possible that these slight effects have an influence on the Earth's climate.Earth has gone through ice ages when worldwide climate was cooler and thick ice covered northern latitudes. Earliest was 5.7 x 10^8 years ago, then 2.8 x 10^8 years ago and then 3 x 10^6 years ago. The effect is somewhat periodic (2.5 x 10^8 year cycles). Cycles of glacial formation within ice ages have cycles of about 4 x 10^4 years. We are now living in a warm period which began 20,000 years ago.MILANKOVITCH's HYPOTHESIS (1920) suggests that the slight changes in the earth's shape, orbits, precession etc. affect the climate and trigger ice ages.For example the elliptical shape of the earth's orbit varies over 10^5 years. If the Earth's orbit became more elliptical and approached the sun more closely in the northern winters (winter solstice) then the northern winters would be warmer. Most of the land mass in where ice can accumulate is in the northern hemisphere. Thus we have a possible effect.The precession of Earth's spin axis also affects when the winters occur with respect to the Earth-sun distance. Again a small effect, but perhaps subtly relevant over 26,000 years.The inclination of Earth's spin axis to its orbital plane also varies over 40,000 years by about 1 degree. This would make the seasons more severe.It is, at some level possible to test this. Depth studies of geological concentrations of various elements and gas concentrations in earth's ocean floors are sensitive to the temperature at the period at which the material was deposited. As it builds up in time, one gets a time history of the temperature through subtle differences in concentrations. In short the evidence is uncertain but possible and still being investigated.Note that all this ignores the fact that the Sun's luminosity changes by a fraction of a percent over various cycles and periods of evolution so it is hard to say what is happening. Same applies for global warming and the greenhouse effect.This is how science works however. Many effects are considered, and some are ruled out eventually, but extensive testing and modeling is required.Note the hierarchy of time scales that are playing a role in this business, and their relation to our daily time scales, and that of the universe at large.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.mhhe.com/earthsci/geology/mcconnell/earths_climate/intro.htm<TEXT>*  Weather is the state of the atmosphere at a given time and place    * Climate represents average weather conditions for a place over a long time period (years)    * The distribution of solar radiation regulates the seasons    * The tilt of Earth's axis is the principal reason for variations in incoming solar radiation    * The intensity of incoming solar radiation decreases from the equator toward the poles    * The Sun is directly over the Tropic of Cancer during Summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and it lies above the Tropic of Capricorn during WinterWeather represents the state of the atmosphere at a given time and place. Characterizing weather requires that we measure conditions such as temperature, precipitation, air pressure, wind speed and direction, humidity. In contrast, climate is the average weather conditions for a site measured over a long time period (years). We must review weather data for several decades to thoroughly characterize a region's climate. Maximum temperatures across the continental U.S. on January 1, 1996.  High temperatures ranged from the high 80's (Florida) to freezing (northern Maine). The daily temperatures represent weather conditions but the overall temperature distribution (cold in the north, warm in the south) reflects regional climate patterns.  Weather and climate are the result of a complex series of interactions between all elements of the earth system (hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, solid earth) but are largely controlled by the interaction between the Earth and Sun. The distribution of solar radiation on the Earth's surface regulates the length and order of the seasons (more solar radiation in summer, less in winter) and drives many of the processes that contribute to weather (e.g. evaporation). We are all aware that temperatures are lower in winter and warmer in summer but few people know why. (What is your answer?)Surely, there are few more basic scientific questions than: Why is it colder in winter than in summer? Yet even graduating seniors at a prestigious eastern University were unable to answer the question correctly (more than 90% got the it wrong). The most common explanation given was that Earth was closer to the Sun in summer and further away in winter - unfortunately, the exact opposite is true. Earth's orbit is a little uneven and the planet comes closest to the Sun during winter in the Northern Hemisphere (January 3) and is farthest away during Summer (July 4).Earth is farthest from the Sun at its aphelion and closest during its perihelion.The Sun is overhead at the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 and at the Tropic of Capricorn on December 21. It is overhead at the equator during the Spring and Fall equinoxes.The principal reason for the seasonal differences in climate around the globe is the tilt of Earth's axis. Earth rotates around an axis that is tilted 23.5 degrees to vertical. The Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn are located 23.5 degrees north and south of the equator respectively. Insolation is greatest when the Sun is directly above a location on Earth and decreases as the angle of the Sun's rays becomes more oblique. The axial tilt places the Sun directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere during the Summer solstice (June 21). Likewise, the Sun's rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more obliquely when the Sun lies over the Tropic of Cancer in the Southern Hemisphere during the Winter solstice (December 21). The Arctic and Antarctic Circles are located 66.5 degrees north and south of the equator (or 23.5 degrees south and north of the North and South Poles respectively).Day and night would each last exactly 12 hours everywhere on the globe if Earth's axis was vertical. In contrast, the hours of daylight change at each point in the Northern Hemisphere from a maximum during the Summer solstice to a minimum on December 21 when the Sun is directly overhead at the Tropic of Capricorn. Day and night are split equally during the equinoxes. The length of each day increases traveling northward during Summer in the Northern Hemisphere and decreases southward in the Southern Hemisphere. Perpetual daylight (24 hours) occurs at the North Pole, while the South Pole is in darkness. This pattern is reversed during the Winter solstice when the South Pole is illuminated for 24 hours and the North Pole is in darkness. The tilt of Earth's axis results in twenty-four hour daylight at the North Pole and almost complete daylight north of the Arctic Circle during summer in the Northern Hemisphere (left) and perpetual darkness during winter (right). The situation is reversed south of the Antarctic Circle.Solar radiation strikes the earth more directly at the equator and tropics than in polar regions. More heat is therefore transferred to the earth in the tropics than at the poles. Global atmospheric circulation patterns represent the planet's attempt to move warm air toward the poles and cold air toward the equatorial region. These patterns are complicated by Earth's rotation, dividing into three large convection cells in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres that control climate patterns. Global temperature and precipitation patterns are directly related to global atmospheric circulation patterns and differentiate climate regions across the globe.Areas with consistent climates are grouped together in climate regions. Climate regions are differentiated based upon monthly temperatures, monthly precipitation, and precipitation values. Archeological, historical and geological records indicate that climate has changed during Earth's history. These climate records give indirect evidence of past climate change over both the long-term (millions of years) and short-term (hundreds or thousands of years).The cause of long-term global climate changes (Causes of Climate Change) are processes that operate on a over intervals measured in millions of years. The most likely causes are associated with the changing locations of continents and oceans (plate tectonics) that in turn affect atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns. Short-term climate fluctuations occur on cycles lasting thousands of years are related to variations in the earth's orbit around the sun that cause the amount of insolation (incoming solar radiation) to vary with time.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/nicole/teaching/ASTR110/lectures/lecture07/slide04.html<TEXT>The Sun does not vary in brightness over the course of a year. Rather, the effective sunlight at any place on the surface of the Earth changes over the year. Because the axis of the Earth is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, different points on the surface of the Earth receive more, or less, sunlight at different times of the year.Here is a figure which shows what we mean by this. The small yellow dot shows the Sun (not drawn to scale, of course!) in the middle of the solar system. The black circle shows the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. This is a circular orbit; it appears elliptical in the figure because we are looking at the system edge-on (as if we were standing on Jupiter) rather than face-on (as if we stood above the Sun). The Earth has been drawn at two points along its orbit; you can see that the axis is tilted 23.5 degrees over from the vertical (straight up). These two points represent the peak of winter (December) and of summer (June), in the northern hemisphere.Let us consider first a simpler case than reality: what if the Earth's axis was not tilted? The Earth would no longer tilt to the right, as it does in the figure above. Instead, it would point straight up, and would rotate every day around that straight-up axis. What would the seasons be like?We would still have different weather conditions across the face of the Earth, but at any point on the surface the weather would always be the same (no more seasons!). The regions near the equator would enjoy a constant, steady level of sunlight, much as they do today. The regions at the poles, however, would receive practically no sunlight at any time of the year - eternal dusk, and eternal winter. The regions between the equator and the poles would be warmest close to the equator, and slowly cool off as we moved towards the poles, but individual places would no longer have seasons (why?). New Mexico would become a land of eternal summer, while the Hudson Bay in Canada would lose its summer and become a land of permanent autumn chill (would the Bay freeze over, year-round)?Examine the next figure, to understand why the equator would be warm and the poles would be cold. At the equator (left-hand part of figure) the Sun would be overhead, and the land would receive the maximum amount of sunlight per unit area. At the poles (right-hand part of figure) the Sun would barely rise above the horizon. The same amount of sunlight, as shown in the figure, would now cover a much larger surface area. This means that the amount of sunlight per unit area would have to drop accordingly, which would make it much colder. This is exactly the difference that we observe every day, between the brightness of the Sun at noon, and the dimness of the Sun in the early morning or early evening. We still see the Sun in the early morning and evening, as it remains entirely above the horizon, but the amount of light that it delivers per unit area is much lower than at noon.This third figure is identical to the second, except that it shows the difference between the sunlight at the equator and the sunlight at the poles in two dimensions rather than in one dimension. Can you see the similarities in the two figures? When we think about sunlight shining on the surface of the Earth, we know that the surface of the Earth is a two dimensional surface (is has width and length, like a square or a circle).Next, what if the Earth's axis was tilted by 90 degrees? The Earth would tilt all the way over in the figure above. In December, the northern hemisphere would be completely hidden from the Sun. All of North America and Eurasia would be as cold as the North pole in the winter -- and as the Sun would never rise, winter would be one six-month long night. At the same time, the southern hemisphere would be enjoying a six-month long summer season, an endless, baking day with no night. In June, the situation would reverse. The northern hemisphere would enjoy a six-month long day of summer, while the southern hemisphere would be plunged into six months of darkness and cold. What would the effect of this be on vegetation and animal life? Would life, as we know it, survive?In the spring and autumn seasons, the weather would appear more normal to us. It would be very similar to the spring and autumn in our first case, where the Earth's axis had no tilt. (Why is this?) All regions of the Earth would have 12 hours of sun and then 12 hours of darkness, every day. The equatorial regions would receive lots of sunlight, while the poles would be significantly cooler.Finally, our situation -- we are lucky that the Earth's axis is tilted a mere 23.5 degrees! This enables us to have seasons, but of enough moderation that life can easily survive. (Is there as much life at the north and south poles as there is at the equator?) We will explore all four of the seasons in the next figure. This figure is very similar to the first one up above, except that it has been switched right to left (December is now on the left, and June on the right) and we have added images of the Earth in spring and in autumn.In December, the northern hemisphere is tiled away from the Sun. There are two specific effects which contribute to cause the seasons. (1) The surface of the northern hemisphere is hidden in the Earth's shadow for more than 12 hours of the day, making the days shorter and the nights longer. (2) The Sun rises far in the south, and never moves high enough above the horizon to stand directly above us, even at noon. The surface of the Earth is thus quite inclined to the incoming sunlight, and so there is less sunlight to absorb per unit area and the climate is cooler. This is exactly the same as the poles receiving less light than the equator in our first case, as was shown in the second figure above (righthand side).At the same time, the southern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. The surface is lit up by the Sun for more than 12 hours per day, and so the days are longer. The Sun rises to the north, but not the far north, and is found overhead at noon. The surface of the Earth is inclined perpendicular to the sunlight (as in the lefthand side of figure 2), and so receives the maximum amount of sunlight per square area.    The situation is most extreme at the north and south poles. At the north pole, the season is one long,cold night which last for six months. At the south pole, the Sun never sets and it is warm for six months continuously. (The Sun is to the left in this figure.)    In March, the two hemispheres have 12 hour days and nights and receive roughly equal amounts of light. The Sun rises at the equator, and the closer to the equator that we stand the higher that it rises in the sky at midday. Notice that this even-handed state persists in all three of the three cases which we have considered (the Earth tilted by zero, 23.5, or 90 degrees) -- why is this?    In June, the situation is reversed from December. The northern hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, and enjoys longer days and more sunlight during the day. The southern hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, hidden in the shadow of the Earth for more than 12 hours every day, and when the Sun is shining it receives less sunlight per unit area.    September has weather very much like June. The two hemispheres have 12 hour days and nights and receive roughly equal amounts of light. The northern hemisphere has autumn weather because it is transitioning from summer to winter (the days start out long and get slowly shorter and cooler), while the southern hemisphere has spring weather because it is moving from winter to summer (the days start out short and get slowly longer and warmer).    The figure below shows the Earth at each of the four seasons, and the sunlight which falls upon it.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.astronomy.org/astronomy-survival/seasons.html<TEXT>Understanding the Seasons    The reason that the weather is warmer in summer and colder in winter for the northern hemisphere is not due to the fact that the earth is nearer to the sun in summer and farther from the sun in winter. In fact, just the opposite is true. The seasons are the result of the differing amounts of solar energy which are received at the earth's surface. This changing insolation is a result of the 23.5 inclination of the earth's axis to the perpendicular of the ecliptic, and the revolution of the earth around the sun. The earth's axis is the imaginary line about which the earth rotates. Expressed in another way, the ecliptic (path of the sun in the sky) is tilted to the plane of the celestial equator by 23.5 . This causes the sun to not only move eastward as the earth revolves around this star, but to also move northward or southward with respect to the celestial equator. This change in the declination of the sun results in three yearly cycles which can be readily observed as the seasons progress:   1. The altitude of the sun changes: The sun reaches its highest position above the horizon at local noon each day. In Allentown, when the sun is at its most northerly position, with respect to the celestial equator, its altitude at noon is at an extreme, 73.5 . This occurs on the first day of summer. On the first day of winter, the sun is as far south of the celestial equator as it can move and achieves its minimum altitude of 26.5  for noon as seen from Allentown.   2. The duration of daylight changes: The longest day of the year occurs for residents of the northern hemisphere when the sun is at its most northerly position with respect to the celestial equator. This marks the time when summer begins. In Allentown, the sun rises in the northeast taking approximately 15 hours before setting in the northwest. The path which the sun takes from rise to set is longest at summer solstice. Therefore the day must also be at its longest, because the earth rotates at a uniform rate. When the sun is at its greatest deviation south of the celestial equator, the day is the shortest. This marks the first day of winter. In Allentown, the sun rises in the southeast, and about nine hours later, it is setting in the southwest.   3. The positions of sunrise and sunset change: For observers in Allentown, the sun rises as far to the north of east and sets as far to the north of west when it is at its maximum declination north of the celestial equator. When the sun is as far to the south of the celestial equator as it can move, on the first day of winter, it rises as far to the south of east and sets as far to the south of west as it can for that location.    In winter, the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. The daily duration of sunshine is restricted, and the sun is lower at noon. The sun's energy strikes the ground at a shallower angle, and thus less energy is received per unit area. The temperature becomes colder. In summer, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun. Not only is the daily duration of sunshine longer, but the sun also climbs to a higher altitude, so that its energy strikes our location more directly, and we receive more energy per unit area. It's time to party in the warmer weather.    The fact that the weather is warmer in the northern hemisphere in summer and colder in winter is NOT because the sun is nearer to us in summer and farther from us in winter. In actuality, the summer sun is three million miles farther from the earth than its winter distance. The two factors which produce the seasonal effects are (1) the duration of sunlit hours experienced during each season and (2) how directly the sun's rays strike the earth's surface. These two factors are in essence due to a single factor, namely the inclination of the plane of earth's equator with the plane of its orbit around the sun. Put another way, the axis of the earth is inclined 23 1/2  from the perpendicular to its orbit.    In summer, the northern half of the earth's axis is tipped toward the sun. Not only is the duration of daylight longest at any place in the northern hemisphere, but the sun transits the meridian at a higher altitude, so that its rays are more nearly vertical and more concentrated. In winter, the northern hemisphere of the earth is tilted away from the sun. The duration of daylight is shorter and the sun transits the meridian at a lower altitude. The sun's rays strike the earth more obliquely and thus impart to the surface of earth less energy per unit area.    As a result of the earth's revolution around the sun, the sun appears to move eastward along the ecliptic approximately one degree per day. The 23.5  tilt of the earth's equator to the plane of its orbit causes this eastward motion to simultaneously have a northward or a southward component depending upon the season. This causes the sun to be north of the celestial equator for half of the year and south of the celestial equator for the other half. The sun's declination changes by 47  This yearly shift is twice the inclination of the celestial equator to the ecliptic. The variation in declination causes the sun's daily path across the sky to change. This creates a variation in the length of time that the sun is above the horizon. </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://hurri.kean.edu/~manfrino/Observing%20the%20Earth/Chapter%202%20Earth%20and%20Sun.htm<TEXT>Earth & Sun    * Nuclear fusion reactions in the Sun's core generate temperatures of millions of degrees and temperature decreases outward to the Sun's surface, the photosphere.    * The solar system is defined by the limits of the Sun's magnetic field, the heliosphere.    * The solar wind, derived from the Sun's magnetic field, can disrupt satellite communication and power systems on Earth.    * The distribution of solar radiation regulates the seasons and provides the energy to drive processes on Earth's surface.    * The tilt of Earth's axis is the principal reason for variations in incoming solar radiation.    * The intensity of incoming solar radiation decreases from the equator toward the poles.    * The Sun is directly over the Tropic of Cancer during summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and it lies above the Tropic of Capricorn during winter. The Sun is the centerpoint of our solar system but is just one of billions of similar stars throughout the universe. The Sun accounts for 99.8% of the mass of the solar system and dwarfs all its orbiting planets. Even mighty Jupiter has just a tenth of the radius of the Sun which has a diameter of 1,390,000 kilometers (870,000 miles). The Sun is a source of light and heat essential for life on Earth. This solar radiation drives the atmospheric circulation systems that provide our weather but the Sun's magnetic field yields a powerful solar wind that governs a much larger space weather system that extends throughout our solar system.Number of years of U.S. energy needs that could be supplied by just one second of the Sun's total energy output: 9,000,000Characteristics of the SunUnlike the terrestrial planets, the Sun is composed exclusively of gases, with hydrogen and helium making up over 99.9% of its mass. The source of the Sun's heat is the conversion of hydrogen atoms to helium by nuclear fusion reactions under the tremendous temperatures and pressures of the Sun's core. These reactions are steadily consuming the Sun's supply of hydrogen and reducing its mass, ensuring that our nearest star will eventually die out. In the meantime the Sun will get brighter and hotter resulting in higher temperatures on Earth, the loss of the almost all water, and the extinction of life well before the light fades. Thankfully, this grim scenario is still billions of years in the future.Figure 13. The interior of the Sun is composed of four principal layers. Temperatures decline outward from a toasty 15,000,000 C in the core to "just" 5,430 C in the photosphere. The relatively thin interface layer is thought to be the source of the Sun's magnetic field. We see the surface of the Sun, the photosphere.Heat is transferred from the core to the outermost layers of the Sun by a combination of radiation and convection (Fig. 13). Radiation transfers heat from an object to its immediate neighbor. Convection occurs when warm and cold materials cycle through a body redistributing heat until the mixture is at equilibrium. For example, when a metal saucepan of water is heated, the warmest water at the bottom of the pan expands and rises and the cooler water at the top sinks forming a rotating convection cell. Heat is distributed throughout the pot as the process continues. In contrast, the heat from the stove passes through the base of the pan and upward through the metal into the handle of the pan by radiation. Radiation transfers heat from the core outward through the radiative zone. Convection cells in the convective zone redistribute heat from the Sun's interior toward its outer surface.Figure 14. Dark blotches on the photosphere are sun spots. Image courtesy of NASA.The interface layer marks the boundary between zones of convection and radiation in the Sun's interior and is thought to be the source of the heliosphere, the Sun's magnetic field. The magnetosphere extends beyond the orbit of Pluto and defines the boundary of the solar system. The Sun rotates about a near-vertical axis about once a month. However, this big ball of gas experiences differential rotation, that is, its equator rotates more rapidly than its polar regions. Equatorial regions of the Sun make a complete rotation every 25 days while the poles may take 36 days. Differential rotation causes twisting of the Sun's outer layers, causing disruptions in the magnetic field that generate sun spots and flares, visible features in the photosphere and chromosphere. The photosphere is the thin outermost layer of the Sun, the surface of the Sun we see through telescopes.Sun spots have been recognized on the surface of the Sun for several centuries and their apparent movement across the Sun's face can be used to measure the periodicity of the Sun's rotation. Sun spots (Fig. 14) represent cooler areas of the photosphere (3,530 C) where intense lines of magnetic force emanate outward. Individual sun spots may be as large as 50,000 km (31,000 miles) in diameter, the approximate size of Neptune. The number of sun spots varies over an eleven year cycle (Fig. 15). We passed through a peak, known as a solar maximum, in the sun spot cycle in the early months of 2001 and are expected to reach the minimum of the cycle in late 2006. There is an intriguing correlation between the period of sun spot inactivity between 1645-1715 known as the Maunder Minimum and the Little Ice Age, an interval of colder-than-average years in the Northern Hemisphere. Flares, intense pulses of X rays, ultraviolet radiation, are often associated with sun spots. Flares and other solar eruptions extend into the chromosphere, an irregular layer above the photosphere (Fig. 16). The solar corona extends for millions of kilometers beyond the chromosphere but is only visible during total eclipses.Figure 16. Solar eruptions take several forms including prominences (left) that project far above the Sun's surface. The bright light of the solar corona (right) is only visible during solar eclipses.Space weather is influenced by flares, sun spots, and coronal emissions but these activities are overprinted on the solar wind, a constant stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun's corona. These particles travel at average speeds of 450 km/sec (1 million miles per hour) and can cause disruptions in Earth's magnetic field and spectacular effects such as the aurora borealis in the upper atmosphere.Earth's magnetic field deflects the solar wind around our planet (Fig. 17), protecting our atmosphere. Where it not for the presence of the magnetic field our atmosphere would have been steadily stripped away, just like the envelope of gases that once surrounded Mars. The red planet lost its protective magnetic field as the smaller planet cooled down more rapidly than Earth, losing its hot liquid core. Mars retains just isolated remnants of its atmosphere where pockets of relict magnetism remain.Figure 17. Earth's magnetic field deflects the solar wind.Although our planet's magnetic field protects us from the erosion of our atmosphere, we are still subject to the harmful effects of occasional solar eruptions that hurl more intense pulses of X rays, ultraviolet radiation, and charged particles toward Earth. Living on the planet's surface we are at little risk of direct harm from these emissions but they pose a threat to astronauts and spacecraft and have the potential to cause disruption of our communication and power supply systems. We depend on over six hundred operational satellites to provide information for a host of needs on Earth, including communications, navigation, and weather forecasting. Many of these satellites would be debilitated by streams of solar radiation. Intense streams of charged particles can disrupt Earth's magnetic field, generating electrical currents that result in power surges leading to blackout conditions as electrical systems shut down. Over six million people in eastern Canada and the northeastern U.S. lost power for nine hours in March 1989 because of a powerful solar storm that coincided with a solar maximum. The economic costs of power outages are measured in hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. Satellites such as SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) monitor activity in the Sun's photosphere and chromosphere and can provide notice of potentially damaging bursts of solar energy heading for Earth (Fig. 18). Such warnings will be vital to future space exploration that will expose astronauts to deadly radiation emissions. Construction of the international space station will imperil the lives of space-walking astronauts unless solar storms can be accurately forecast and sufficient warning given.Figure 18. Three views of the Sun taken by the SOHO satellite showing increasing solar activity (more sun spots, solar flares, prominences, and coronal mass ejections) approaching a solar maximum, a peak in the sun spot cycle. Dates of images are 1997 (left), 1998 (center), and 1999 (right).  The Earth-Sun SystemWeather and climate are the result of a complex series of interactions between all elements of the earth system (hydrosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, solid earth) but are largely controlled by the interaction between the Earth and Sun. The distribution of solar radiation on Earth's surface regulates the order of the seasons and divides day and night. The Northern Hemisphere receives more solar radiation in summer and less in winter. Surely, there are few more basic scientific questions than: Why is it colder in winter than in summer? (What is your answer?) Yet even graduating seniors at a prestigious eastern university were unable to answer the question correctly (almost all got it wrong). The most common explanation given was that Earth was closer to the Sun in summer and further away in winter - unfortunately, the exact opposite is true (Fig. 19). Earth's orbit is a little uneven and the planet comes closest to the Sun during winter in the Northern Hemisphere (January 3) and is farthest away during Summer (July 4).Figure 19. Earth is farthest from the Sun at its aphelion and closest during its perihelion.Figure 20. The Sun is overhead at the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 and at the Tropic of Capricorn on December 21. It is overhead at the equator during the Spring and Fall equinoxes.The principal reason for the seasonal differences in climate around the globe is the tilt of Earth's axis (Fig. 20). Earth rotates around an axis that is tilted 23.5 degrees to vertical. The Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn are located 23.5 degrees north and south of the equator, respectively (Fig. 21). Insolation, the amount of solar radiation received by Earth, is greatest when the Sun is directly above a location on Earth and decreases as the angle of the Sun's rays becomes more oblique. The axial tilt places the Sun directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer solstice (June 21). Likewise, the Sun's rays strike the Northern Hemisphere more obliquely when the Sun lies over the Tropic of Cancer in the Southern Hemisphere during the winter solstice (December 21).Figure 21. Relative positions of the equator and tropics. The Arctic and Antarctic Circles are located 66.5 degrees north and south of the equator (or 23.5 degrees south and north of the North and South Poles, respectively).Day and night would each last exactly 12 hours everywhere on the globe if Earth's axis were vertical. In contrast, the hours of daylight change at each point in the Northern Hemisphere from a maximum during the summer solstice to a minimum on December 21 when the Sun is directly overhead at the Tropic of Capricorn. Day and night are split equally during the equinoxes. The length of each day increases traveling northward during summer in the Northern Hemisphere and decreases southward in the Southern Hemisphere. Perpetual daylight (24 hours) occurs at the North Pole, while the South Pole is in darkness. This pattern is reversed during the winter solstice when the South Pole is illuminated for 24 hours and the North Pole is in darkness (Fig 22).Figure 22. The tilt of Earth's axis results in 24-hour daylight at the North Pole and almost complete daylight north of the Arctic Circle during summer in the Northern Hemisphere (left) and perpetual darkness during winter (right). The situation is reversed south of the Antarctic Circle. Think about it . . .   1. How would climate differ if Earth's axis were vertical instead of tilted?   2. Which of the statements found here would be most likely to be true if Earth's axis were vertical?  External Energy and the Earth SystemA fraction of the Sun's energy reaches the earth as solar radiation, the process by which heat passes through a gas, liquid, or vacuum. Most solar radiation reaching Earth is absorbed by the land or oceans. Air masses are warmed or cooled by the land or ocean below. Warm tropical air rises over the equatorial oceans. As the air rises it gradually cools and releases moisture as rain. Cooler air eventually sinks, returning to the surface to repeat the cyclical journey that represents convection, the movement within materials driven by different temperature conditions (Fig. 23).Figure 23. Atmospheric convection cells generated by contrasts in solar radiation on a rotating Earth.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.mbgnet.net/sets/temp/seasons.htm<TEXT>The temperate deciduous forest has four changing seasons. These forests have hot summers and cold winters. As the seasons change, so do the colors of the leaves of the deciduous trees. Deciduous means that these plants lose their leaves every year and grow them back. Reasons for Seasons The four seasons happen because of the tilt of the Earth's axis. At different times of the year, the sun's rays hit different parts of the globe more directly. The angle of the Earth's axis tilts the Northern Hemisphere towards the sun during the summer. Without the tilt of the earth's axis, we wouldn't have seasons. Instead, the areas around the equator would receive the most sun and the northern and southern hemispheres would be stuck in a gradual gradient of hot to cold. The seasons would not change, it would be about the same temperature year round and there would be no seasons.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://analyzer.depaul.edu/paperplate/Seasons.htm<TEXT>Background:  The cause of the seasons is due to the angle of the sunlight striking the ground.  When the sun is high overhead, the light is more concentrated (summer) and when the sun is low the light is more spread out (winter).  Measuring the sun's height at mid-day (See Altitude of Noon Sun or Altitude of Noon Sun II.) is a good exercise to prepare for this lesson.  Most students think the sun is closer in summer and farther away in winter.  The orbit of the earth is not a perfect circle, but the earth is closest in January.  The sun is lowest for us in the northern hemisphere in mid to late December.  The "lag-time" between the low sun and the coldest temperatures in January, is caused by the time it takes for the earth to cool off, just like the hottest time of day is late afternoon, not noon when the sun is highest (and the coldest daily temperature is many times after sunrise!) The cause of the sun being at different mid-day heights during the year is the tilt of the earth's axis.  If the earth did not have tilt, there would be no seasons.  To explain this to students, use the extreme.  Show the earth with no tilt, then with 90 degrees of tilt, then with 23.5 degrees tilt as it really is.  Most errors are made when students are moving the 'earth' around the 'sun', they want to point the axis toward the sun and keep it toward the sun as it orbits (when showing 90 degrees tilt).  This is why it is important to imagine a distant star much farther away than the sun to which the earth always is pointed.  For scale, Polaris is 820 light YEARS away while the sun is 8.5 light MINUTES away.  "First use 2 plates to make a paper plate sphere (See exercise below or variation shown in Core of the Matter).  Label the sphere with a north pole, south pole and equator.  Pretend the earth were not tilted.  The equator would then always be toward the sun (maximum heat due to the sun's energy coming straight down to the ground).  The poles would always be in twilight with the light coming from the horizon.  If you have trouble seeing this, cut out a small circle of paper (about the size of a penny).  Pretend you are standing in the middle of it and the edges are your horizon.  Place it at the equator and then at the poles.  Look at the light from the bulb hitting the paper. "Now pretend the sphere is tilted over 90 degrees.  As it moves around the sun, first one pole would be pointing toward the sun, then the equator, then the other pole, then the equator, and finally the first pole again.  Think about what the seasons would be like standing at different points on the sphere."  "The Earth is tilted over 23.5 degrees from the first exercise.  You can estimate this by thinking about half of 90 is 45, half of 45 is 22.5, which is within one degree of the way Earth is tilted.  Place your little circle of paper at different points on your sphere and describe the seasons."  Actual tilt of the objects in our solar system: Mercury              0.0  degrees Venus              177.0  degrees  making it spin backwards Earth                 23.4  degrees Moon                  6.7  degrees Mars                  25.2  degrees Jupiter                  3.2  degrees Saturn                 26.7  degrees Uranus                 97.9  degrees  similar to activity Neptune              28.8  degrees       Pluto                      94 degrees  similar to Uranus Paper Plate Exercise:  MAKING A SPHERE  You will need at least three paper plates and scissors.  You may want to use more plates depending on the degree of detail you want in your sphere.  Stack two plates and cut to the center from the edge.  This edge becomes the end.  (Fold in 4ths first if you want a line to follow and identify the center.)  Turn one plate half way around so the slots face each other.  Put them together and hold them so it makes an "X" when you look at them from the end.  The ends become the poles of the spheres.  Half way between the poles is the equator.  Mark the point on one plate and cut half way to the center.  Cut the third plate in half.  Start from the center and cut half way to the edge.  Place this 3rd plate slot to the slot marked for the sphere's equator and slide them together.  Label your sphere.  Mark one end "north", the opposite end "south", between them the "equator".  The outer edge of the plate making the equator can represent a latitude line and trying to add other latitude lines north and/or south of this will show students you need a smaller plate as you get near the poles until the latitude line becomes a dot at the poles.  The edge of the plates running from pole to pole represent the longitude lines.  You would use full size plates to add more lines and see they would be farther apart near the equator and closer together near the poles.  The sphere can represent a planet such as earth or any of the other planets.  The sphere can also represent the sky if you pretend the earth is a dot at the center of the sphere and then the latitude lines become declination lines and the longitude lines become right ascension lines.  If you add several plates and then cover the sphere with papermache, you could have students draw surface detail for any of the planets being studied, or draw stars for the celestial sphere appearing to surround us in space.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast161/Unit2/seasons.html<TEXT>The Earth's rotation axis is tilted relative to the plane of its orbit around the Sun: *   Tilt is about 23.5 degrees from perpendicular relative to the  Ecliptic Plane.The Earth's axis points towards the same direction in space as we orbit around the Sun: *   Currently points near Polaris. *  Changes slowly with time (as we'll see below)The Vernal & Autumnal EquinoxesIn March & September: *   Axis is at right angles to the Earth-Sun line. *  The Sun is seen on the Celestial Equator. *  Day and Night are equal length (12 hours).March: Vernal Equinox *   Northern Spring & Southern Autumn.September: Autumnal Equinox *   Northern Autumn & Southern Spring.Winter SolsticeIn December: *   The Earth's axis tilts away from the Sun. *  The Sun is at its maximum southern declinationNorthern Winter: *   The Sun is low in the sky. *  The day is shorter than the nightSouthern Summer: *   The Sun is high in the sky. *  The day is longer than the nightSummer SolsticeIn June: *   The Earth's axis tilts towards from the Sun. *  The Sun is at its maximum northern declinationNorthern Summer: *   The Sun is high in the sky. *  The day is longer than the nightSouthern Winter: *   The Sun is low in the sky. *  The day is shorter than the night The picture below summarizes the direction of the Sun at the four seasons:Insolation What matters for solar heating is how directly the rays of the sun hit the ground: Sun directly overhead (at Zenith): *   Maximum concentration of sunlight. *  Get ~1000 Watts/meter2 of heating.Sun 30  above the Horizon: *   Sunlight spreads out over 2 meter2 *  Get only 500 Watts/meter2 of heating.The Earth-Sun Distance The Earth's orbit is slightly elliptical, so that the Earth is closer to the Sun at some times, and farther away at others. Aphelion (greatest distance): *   Earth is 152.1 Million kilometers from the Sun *  Occurs in early July (e.g., 2005 July 5)Perihelion (closest approach): *   Earth is 147.1 Million kilometers from the Sun *  Occurs in early January (e.g., 2005 Jan 2)The difference in distances is about 5 Million kilometers.

It is also called obliquity.A planet whose rotation axis were perpendicular to the the plane on which a body is orbiting orbital plane would have an axial tilt of 0 . In our solar system, the orbital plane that contains the earth is known as the plane of the eclipticThe great circle representing the apparent annual path of the sun; the plane of the Earth's orbit around the sun; makes an angle of about 23 degrees with the ecliptic.Earth has an axial tilt of 23.5 . The Earth is tilted in the same direction throughout a year; however, as the Earth orbits theSun, the hemisphere tilted away from the Sun will gradually come to be tilted towards the Sun, whereas the hemisphere tilted towards the Sun will come to be tilted away from the Sun.Axial tilt is mainly responsible for the seasons. During part of the year one hemisphere (or the other) is tilted toward the Sun, resulting in longer days and shorter nights; during the rest of the year the hemisphere is tilted away from the sun. Not only does axial tilt cause the hours of sunlight to vary but it can also result in sunlight striking the ground at a more (summer) or less (winter)The Earth's axial tilt varies between 21.5  and 24.5  with a 41,000 year periodicity, while the direction of the tilt gradually undergoes precession, moving in a slow circle over a period of about 25,800 years. However, other factors may change the axial tilt of Earth (and of other planets).Through time, axial precession changes the position of the Earth in its orbit at which the seasons occur (Precession of the equinoxes). This has little effect on the amount of solar influx (insolation) during times when the orbit is circular, but can have large effects on the strength of the seasons when the Earth's orbit is highly elliptical (Milankovitch cycles). The effects of axial precession on seasons can be seen in the following chart.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.kstrom.net/isk/stars/starkno3.htm<TEXT>Pole StarThe brightest star in Ursa Minor; at the end of the handle of the little dipper; the northern axis of the earth points toward it.The earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23 degrees to this plane, as it revolves around the sun. So the earth tilts at different angles to the sun, as it revolves in orbit, shown here for the 4 seasons. When the earth's north polar axis is tilted most toward the sun, it's summer in the northern hemisphere, tilted furthest away, winter.Of course this tilt affects the sun's path across the sky -- furthest north in summer, south in winter, and the fixed stars in the night sky rise at different times and places, too.Whether they know this cause or not, all peoples who observe the skies know this relationship shown for the sun's path across the sky at 4 key days during the year -- days sacred to most indigenous peoples.Landmarks can be used if a people are always in the same place to mark the sunrise and sunset points of these four days. On a compass rose -- which looks very much like the traditional star quilt pattern -- the line between the northeast and northwest tips marks the summer solstice, when the sun is farthest north, and the line between southeast and southwest tips the winter solstice sunpath. The line across the middle -- from east to west -- is the line of both equinoxes.The Lakota were nomadic and didn't always camp at the same spots. The angle of direction and length of the sun's noon shadow can be determined, and provides a simple way to identify these 4 key days that mark the earth's seasons. There are painted hides usually identified in museums as "bonnet" or "circles". These resemble elaborate compass roses used by mariners, and would be handy and portable for making solar shadow time measurements, if a stick with a plumb-bob (an arrowhead, say) were placed upright in the center of the pattern.Of course there are stars in the sky in daytime; we can't see them because of the sun. This brings us to where we can explain timing of the start of the Lakota sacred spring ceremonial round. It begins, the elders say, when the sun enters the Lakota constellation Dried Willow. This includes Triangulum (which isn't too bright) and the brighter stars in Aries, the Ram. This was traditional in Western ancient astronomy too; spring, the vernal equinox, began when the sun was in Aries, and that was the start of the astronomical year for star-watchers. An easy way to tell when this has happened is by the first-magnitude star Antares ("the opposite of Aries"). Here's what happens when the sun is "in" Aries or Dried Willow:So early evening rising just south of the ecliptic (sunpath horizon point) of first magnitude Antares (I don't know its Lakota name) indicates the sun has entered the Dried Willow constellation. Some time ago, this happened around March 20-21, the spring equinox, and was the signal for the Pipe Ceremony at winter camps that heralded a ceremonial round in the Black Hills, ending with a Solstice Sun Dance at Devil's Tower, (Grey Buffalo Horn) when the sun entered the Bear's Tipi constellation (part of Gemini) that represents it.Now, though, everything in the skies happens about a month later than when these ancient observational calendars -- Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Chinese, as well as Lakota -- were drawn up. This happens because the earth's north-south axis revolves around the center of the earth, so the poles slowly sweep out 2 cones in the sky, joined at their tips in the earth's center. This cycle is called the precession of the equinoxes or precessional cycle. (Its cause is a gyroscopic effect of the moon's gravitational attraction to the earth's tidal bulge.) It takes about 26,000 years for one complete revolution to sweep out the double cone. During this time, the pole star changes, to whatever stars lie on the circle swept by the north-pointing end of the earth's axis. The Pole Star -- Wichahpi Owanjila, star that always stands in one place -- was Thuban (Alpha Draconis) in 3000 B.C. Around 7500 AD, Alpha Ceiphei will be the pole star, then Deneb, then bright Vega (14000 AD), then it'll swing around to Thuban again. For many centuries there has been and will be no bright star close enough to where the pole is to serve as pole star; the bright northern stars and constellations then seem to revolve through the night about an empty center.Now, the constellations are all displaced by about a month, a little more than 30 degrees, as regards when the sun enters them (i.e. where/when they rise). The sun is in Dried Willow (or Aries) now around April 23, instead of March 21; it gets to the Pleiades (Animal's head) about a month late, and it's about a month late entering Mato Tipila, for the Sun Dance at Devil's Tower. From this, we can date the most probable origin of this knowledge and these ceremonies. It takes 26,000 years for the poles to precess the big double-cone 360 degrees for the great Polar Sky Circle, so it takes about 72 years to precess one degree. Since the poles have precessed about 30 degrees, (30 x 72 = 2160) years ago the stars were in the right places at the right times to guide the ceremonies as Lakota elders still recall. Many Sun Dances have tended to be held quite late in the summer in recent years. Where these are guided by knowledgeable elders who make star observations, it seems likely those elders follow the stars, even though that puts them a month or more behind the sun.It's the same dilemma astrologers face. None of the constellations that represent animals of the monthly zodiac corresponds any longer to the birth month you see in those little horoscopes in many newspapers. The original observations are too old; the earth's poles have revolved too far. It will be more than 20,000 years before they come back around again, and the traditional constellations are once again in synch with key solar dates that determine the earth's seasonal round.Be aware that the dates for solstices and equinoxes are approximate. For example, in 1996, the vernal equinox is March 20, summer solstice is June 20, fall equinox is September 22, and winter solstice is December 21. So the dates on my diagrams are a "within 2 days" approximation.Details of the sun's path through the starry skies over a solar year, and a large chart of the major constellations, ends with a comparison of how the sun's current apparent path relates to the constellations at the time these astronomical observations were made, 2,000 years ago (still used for horoscope chartings in the discredited science of astrology).</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://avc.comm.nsdlib.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Seasons_In_The_Sun<TEXT>One of the least understood aspects of natural climate variability is what causes the seasonal changes of the annual cycle: the tilt of the earth's axis. This is very non-intuitive and difficult to convey to students.In the classic documentary film "A Private Universe", several students graduating from a prestigious university are interviewed about some basic science concepts. They are asked to explain the reason for the changing seasons. Many incorrectly state that the seasons change due to variations in distance between the Earth and the sun. Unfortunately, this misconception is shared by many adults and children. It would surely surprise them to learn that our sun is actually closer to the Earth during a northern hemisphere winter than during the summer!  By using both kinesthetic experiences and conceptual modeling, it is possible to overcome this common misconception.The Earth orbits the sun once every 365 1/4 days. While its orbit is slightly elliptical (not perfectly circular), variations in the distance between the Earth and the sun are not enough to cause the seasonal changes. Instead, the 23.5 degree fixed tilt of the Earth's axis is the primary reason for the changing seasons. When the northern hemisphere is tilted into the sun, those on this part of the Earth enjoy summer while those in the southern hemisphere experience winter. When the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, the opposite occurs - winter is celebrated north of the equator and summer south of the equator. It's only when the sun is positioned above the equatorial latitudes that both hemispheres experience the spring and autumn seasons (Fig. 3). Fig. 3 - The Earth's orbit and the seasons It may surprise your students to learn that every spot on Earth receives the same amount of daylight over the course of a year. Shorter winter days are balanced by longer summer days. However, not every part of the Earth receives the same intensity of sunlight. This is due to the curvature of the Earth. In latitudes near the equator, sunlight falls more intensely on a smaller area. The sunlight also travels through less atmosphere than at higher latitudes. The same amount of sunlight is spread over a wider area and passes through more of the atmosphere at the higher latitudes, thus giving less heat. During summer, the sun appears higher in the sky, its radiational heating is more intense, and daylight hours are longer. Winter brings shorter daylight hours, a lower position of the sun in the sky, and less intense radiational heating. 1. The students will learn that the tilt of the Earth is the primary cause for the changing of the seasons. 2. The students will demonstrate how the intensity of radiational heating varies due to the curvature of the Earth and the amount of atmosphere through which it must pass. Ask your students to describe visible signs of seasonal change. (Answers might include observing migrating birds, flowers blooming, and leaves changing color) Do they have a favorite season of the year? Ask them to explain the reasons for the changing seasons. (The fixed tilt of the Earth on its axis in relation to its orbital path around the sun) Be prepared for some surprise answers! Place a lamp fixture in a central location of your classroom. Secure the electric cord to the floor to keep students from tripping over it. Remove the lamp shade and place a large soft white variety bulb in the lamp. Turn on the lamp and turn off the classroom lights. Have a student volunteer hold an Earth globe and walk around the lamp (sun) modeling the orbital path of the Earth. If viewed from above, the student should be walking in a counterclockwise direction. Mark the classroom floor with the dates of the spring and fall equinox and the summer and winter solstice. Be sure the student does not change the orientation of the axis while orbiting the model sun. Point out changes in how the globe is illuminated by the lamp at different locations in its orbit. Ask the students to identify the positions in its orbit which represent the four seasons of the northern hemisphere. Next, turn off the lamp and turn on the flashlight which now represents the sun. Hold the globe 3 feet away from the flashlight and place the cardboard baffle with the one inch hole between them. Adjust the distances so as to shine a one inch beam of light on the equator. Have a student measure the size of the beam of light on the globe. Slowly tilt both the flashlight and cardboard to move the light beam away from the equator, being careful not to change their relative positions. Have students measure the size of the light beam as it moves north or south. While the new locations receive the same amount of light, what happens to the light's intensity at any one point? Where on the globe is the light beam most intense? While spring officially begins on the vernal equinox and fall on the autumnal equinox, signs of the changing seasons can be observed earlier or later based on latitude. Use the globe/lamp/flashlight models to demonstrate why signs of spring arrive earlier in the southern states and why deciduous leaves begin to fall earlier in northern parts of the country. After demonstrating the orbital path of the Earth around the Sun, select various objects located along the walls of the classroom (clock, bulletin board, posters, etc.) to represent stars and constellations in space. Have the student face away from the lamp while carrying the globe around the model Sun and call out the names of these objects as they come into his/her view. It should become clear why we see different stars and constellations along the horizon throughout the course of a year. Share some extreme state records for high and low temperatures. A listing of such data can be found in the back of the The Weather Book by USA Today, written by Jack Williams. If all locations on Earth receive the same amount of daylight over the course of a year, why do different parts of the country experience such a wide range in temperature? (The curvature of the Earth leads to variations in the angle of the sunlight, the length of daylight, and the amount of atmosphere through which the rays must pass)</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/students/iceage/iceage2.htm<TEXT>Research has shown that the amount of sunlight shining  on the polar region determines when ice ages occur. Less sunlight shining  on the northern polar region has been linked to the last four ice ages.  Interglacial  periods (time between glacial epochs) occur when the area receives more  sunlight. Why? I knew you were going to ask! The amount of sunlight changes  due to the orbit of Earth about the sun and the tilt of Earth (23.5 degrees)  on its imaginary axis. (It's important to remember these important factors  as you read on.) These orbit and tilt variations are due to interactions  between Earth, Sun, the moon, and other planets. Scientists refer to this as  astronomical forcing. It is the tilt of Earth's axial rotation that creates seasons. During the summer (warm) season in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted toward the sun and the sun is high in the sky at noon. This allows the sun's rays to come in more perpendicular to the ground on the Northern Hemisphere. During the winter (cold) season in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted away from the sun. The sun stays close to the horizon, and days are short. In the Southern hemisphere, the sun is high in the sky at noon, and days are longer. This is why the seasons are reverse in the two hemispheres. While those of us living in the Northern Hemisphere enjoy summer, our neighbors in the Southern Hemisphere are experiencing winter.Earth wobbles slightly on its axis of rotation, giving rise to a precession, or wobble, with a time period of about 23,000 to 26,000 years. Because Earth "wobbles" (like a spinning top) in space, its tilt changes between 22 and 25 degrees on a cycle of about 41,000 years. That's a long time just to get back to where you started! It's during the periods of less tilt (cooler summers) that scientist believe snow and ice in the high latitudes tend to last (without melting) from year to year. The build-up of this snow and ice from year to year creates massive ice sheets.Equinox  is another term you'll need to be familiar with before you can fully understand present theories on the occurrence of ice ages. An equinox is the time when the sun crosses the equator, making night and day of equal length in all parts of Earth. In the Northern Hemisphere, the vernal (spring) equinox occurs about March 21 and the autumnal (autumn) equinox occurs about September 22. It is during the vernal and autumnal equinoxes that the sun is overhead at the equator throughout the day. In other words, the angle of incidence of the sun's rays to Earth's surface at noon on the equator is 90 degrees. The sun's rays at the equator at noon are perpendicular to Earth's surface. The tilt of the Earth's rotational axis changes over a period of time.Changes in the degree of Earth's tilt can cause the seasons to become more or less severe. More tilt would result in colder winters and hotter summers, while less tilt would result in cooler summers and milder winters. Other processes are also important. During ice ages, snow and ice build up on the land close to the poles. Because of this build-up, more of Earth is covered with ice and snow giving it more albedo. In simpler terms, the whiteness of the snow and ice reflects the sun's energy back into space. Thus, more cooling takes place. As the ice sheets continue to grow, scientists also believe less carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere. This adds to the cooling process.  The above image shows how much the Earth's orbit can vary in shape.  This process in a slow one, taking roughly 100,000 to cycle. Earth's orbit (path around the sun) is slightly elliptical  (oval-shaped). This means that Earth is slightly closer to the sun during  some parts of its year-long orbit and further away at other times. The closest  approach of Earth to the sun is called  perihelion,  and it now occurs in January, making Northern Hemisphere winters slightly  warmer. Eleven thousand years ago, perihelion occurred in July, making the  summer slightly warmer in the Arctic. Periodic changes in the "roundness" of Earth's orbit varies in cycles of 100,000 to 400,000 years. This affects how important "timing of the perihelion" is to the strength of the seasons. The growth and retreat of ice sheets are thought to be controlled by the combination of: the tilt cycle which takes 41,000 years from onset to completion  the year precession cycle which is 26,000 years, and   the perhaps smaller effect of Earth's orbit  eccentricities  (non-circular and elliptical) cycle which can take 100,000 to 400,000  years for completion. This seems reasonable as each of these cycles has a definite effect on the severity of the summer and winter seasons. Ice  cores obtained by boring deep into Earth's ice sheets provide scientists  with information of Earth's paleoclimate.  Two ice cores through the Greenland ice sheet have provided a continuous  record of atmospheric conditions over Greenland from  abut 100,000 years ago to present time. The ice cores show remarkable temperature  variability (changes) over the past 100,000 years with rapid warming and  cooling  of the northern hemisphere, sometimes within decades (tens of years).</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.sciencenetlinks.com/sci_update.cfm?DocID=167<TEXT>What made Earth a Tilt-A-World? I'm Bob Hirshon and this is Science Update. Every 24 hours, the earth spins around once on its axis-an axis that's tilted 23 degrees with respect to earth's orbit. Vijay Thurimella of Denver, Colorado, wants to know how earth got that way.  We consulted Clark Wilson, a Geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin. He says earth's tilt came about early in the formation of the solar system, four and a half billion years ago. Back then, a lot of dust and rocks were floating around and crashing into each other. That debris eventually stuck together to form the planets.  Wilson:  That process is a little messy, and in the case of the earth, probably led to some big impacts that eventually tilted the axis to what it is, 23 degrees now. One of those big impacts, for example, ejected a lot of debris that eventually coalesced to form the moon.  But Wilson says earth doesn't get knocked around much anymore.  Wilson:  Most of those objects are gone, and we're left with sort of little pieces, asteroids and so on, that would not significantly change the earth's orbit or rotational axis direction now. If a science question's got you off-axis, call us at 1-800-Why-Isit. Or e-mail us from our website, www.scienceupdate.com. For the American Association for the Advancement of Science, I'm Bob Hirshon. Making Sense of the ResearchFirst of all, let's be sure we're clear on what the Earth's axis is. Basically it's an imaginary stick going through the center of the earth, if we define the center as "the point around which it rotates." In other words, picture the earth spinning like a top, straight up and down. Now picture a stick going right through the center of the earth. If the earth weren't tilted, it would rotate like that as it revolved around the sun, and we wouldn't have seasons-only areas that were colder (near the poles) and warmer (near the Equator).  But the earth is tilted, and that's why the seasons happen. When the Northern Hemisphere is pointed toward the sun, it gets more hours of sunlight. Temperatures rise, and you get summer in New York, while it's darker and cooler "down under" in Sydney. Six months later, the reverse is true, and it's the Southern Hemisphere that experiences summer. The 23-degree tilt also explains why changes in daylight during the seasons are very dramatic near the poles (which are flooded with sunlight all day long in summer and get virtually no light in mid-winter) but barely perceptible near the equator (where the sun shines more or less equally throughout the year).  Getting back to why the axis exists, it's mainly the result of the rough-and-tumble environment of the early solar system. Scientists believe that the sun and the nine planets formed by chunks of rock and debris that self-accumulated through gravity. In other words, objects collided and clumped together, which increased their gravitational pull, which in turn drew more objects in, which made the object even more gravitationally powerful, and so on until the solar system looks like a sun and nine fairly neat planets with not much stray junk flying around.  Of course, occasionally these forming objects happen to attract something that's big enough to knock it off-kilter. That's what probably happened to the earth, after it was already large enough to start rotating. Actually, Wilson says it probably took several substantial impacts to whack the earth into the position it's in today.  Incidentally, back in the "old days," the earth used to rotate a lot faster-once every 6 to 10 hours at the start of the solar system-and the moon's gravity has played a big role in slowing us down to 24. It's a good thing too, because a 6-hour day would certainly lead to an awfully hectic work week.  Now try and answer these questions: 1.    What does it mean to say the earth rotates on a 23 degree axis? 2.    How does this tilt create the seasons? Why are seasons more dramatic in some places than in others? 3.    What probably caused the axis to tilt the way it does? 4.    Leaving aside the question of the damage done by the impact, what would happen if today the Earth's axis were knocked back to 0 degrees? What if it were tilted 45 degrees? 90 degrees? How would life on earth change? Would all parts of the earth be habitable? Cite about specific places in the world and how their climate and daylight patterns would be affected.

The north end  of the axis points in the same direction almost directly to the North Star. On June 21 the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the  sun. This is when the Northern Hemisphere receives its maximum  radiation. Dec. 21 the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the  sun. The Northern Hemisphere receives its minimum radiation from  the sun. This is the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere  and the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere.  Activities1.Use a globe and a lamp without a  shade to demonstrate how the sun shines on the earth. Have one  student take the globe and slowly circle around the lamp, spinning  the globe slowly as he moves. Have the student stop at different  points during orbit. On each stop have the student tell which  portion of the earth would be warmer, which would be colder.  Explain that this is what causes the seasons. 2.

The most important reason is that the Earth's orbit or path around the sun is almost circular. The distance of the Earth from the sun does change, but it is so slight that it makes very little difference in the heat energy felt on the Earth. For example, if you were sitting 30 meters from the fireplace and moved 30 centimeters closer, you would not feel that much warmer than what you felt before. Therefore, it is not the Earth's distance from the sun that causes the change in our seasons. What causes the changes in the seasons on Earth? The two things that make an impact on the seasons are the angle of the Sun above the horizon and how long the sun stays in the sky at a given latitude (the amount of daylight). When the sun is most nearly overhead, the ground gets the hottest. At noon, the sun is at an angle that is most nearly vertical. At sunrise or sunset, the angle from the horizon is smaller so the ground is cooler. The angle above the horizon at noontime is important because it determines how much concentrated light and energy the Earth receives at a specific point. An area that receives more light more directly overhead, gets the hottest. Also, the longer the sun is above the horizon on a given day, the longer it will radiate light and energy. This factor is not nearly as important as the angle of the sun above the horizon. This lesson demonstrates how the angle of the sun above the horizon changes. What causes the Earth to be at a different angle from the sun at different times of the year? The tilt of the Earth's axis is what makes this difference. The angle of the Earth's axis from the plane of its orbit is about 66.5  above the plane, which is 23.5  from being perpendicular to the plane of the Earth's orbit (90  - 66.5  = 23.5  ). The seasons are caused because the Earth is not perpendicular (90  angle) to the Earth's orbit around the sun. If your students have either studied the celestial sphere or have done some observations of the sun then it will help them be more prepared for this activity. Students should be made aware that the sun moves across the sky always staying above the same latitude on a given day. </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/ast99/ast99578.htm<TEXT>Thanks for your question, Paul. It is true that Earth is closer to the sun than average during Northern Hemisphere winter and farther from the sun than average during Northern Hemisphere summer. The specific proximal (close) and distal (far) points along Earth's orbit around the sun are called "perihelion" and "aphelion," respectively, and will occur roughly on January 4 and July 4 of this year (these dates progressively change over time as a consequence of the planet's orbital path constantly changing shape.) The distances to the sun at perihelion and aphelion are approximately 147.5 million kilometers and 152.6 million kilometers, respectively. This change in distance can be explained by the ellipsoidal (non-circular or oval) shape of Earth's orbital path around the sun. Instead of the sun occupying a singular, unique center of that path, it occupies one of two points called "foci" which can be found slightly and equally offset to either side of what would be considered the true center of Earth's orbital path. Imagine a horizontally oriented oval-shaped face with two eyes at the center and one of those eyes winking at you, and you will have areasonably accurate depiction of what the Earth-Sun orbital system looks like when viewed from above or below the orbital plane.Although it may seem that Earth's relative distance to the sun would be a prominent factor in determining seasonal changes in temperature, it pales in comparison to the prominence of the planet's axial tilt with respect to controlling temperature, or more accurately, distribution of solar energy. It is the axial tilt (presently 23.45 degrees), in fact, which determines seasonality. During Northern Hemisphere summers, the north pole is oriented in such a way as to be pointing in the general direction of (not directly at) the sun; during Northern Hemisphere winters, the north pole is pointing away from the sun. I should clarify this by saying that the north pole points in essentially the same direction throughout the year (i.e. Polaris, the North Star), regardless of where it is in its orbital path.Incidentally, it is for just this reason that the polar regions are immersed in full to partial darkness during certain parts of the year(i.e. the north pole during northern winters.) When a region of the surface of Earth is more straightly facing the sun (like northern latitudes do during northern summers), the amount of sunlight falling on that surface is greater than when that surface is more obliquely facing the sun (like northern latitudes do during northern winters.) This seasonal change in the amount of incident solar radiation per unit area on the surface of Earth is ultimately what determines the seasonal changes in temperature. Any introductory astronomy text will have illustrations that depict what I have described  here, if the mental visualization is difficult (which it certainly can  be.)  I hope this explanation helps.Remember that it is only called "winter months" (December-March) - in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, these months are actually "summer months". This particular datum should suggest to you that it is not the relative closeness to the Sun that controls winter/summer, but rather the tilt of the Earth's axis away or towards the Sun and the relative exposures to the Sun of each hemisphere.The other way to think about this (although requiring a bit more Math) is to try to calculate how much more energy does the Earth get during perihelion and aphelion. You could, for example try to factor in how many more degrees of sunlight would be captured by the Earth as it gets closer (assuming that there is not much loss in sunlight energy over the different distances).What you say is true.  The earth is closer to the sun in the northern winter.The seasons are caused more by the tilt of the earth's axis with respectto the sun.  In summer, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward thesun.  It gets more direct solar radiation and the days are longer.The Earth's orbit about the Sun is almost circular -- but not quite. It isa bit closer to the Sun in winter (in the northern hemisphere), but thatis not the major cause of seasons. The major seasonal changes are causedby the tipping of the Earth's axis of rotation that alternately exposesthe northern and southern hemispheres toward the Sun. The following siteprovides details:The reason for it getting cold in the northern winter is to dowith the Earth's tilt on its axis of rotation (23? ) when the NorthPole is tilted away from the Sun; and likewise it is cold in theSouthern Hemisphere 6 months later, when the South Pole is tilted awayfrom the Sun.The coldness of winter (or the warmth of summer) is governed bythe amount of time the Sun is above the horizon. This helps seasonalwinds etc. to dominate in one season rather than the other.The difference of 5,000,000 km (3,000,000 miles) between theclosest point (perihelion) and furthest point (aphelion) from the Sunis so small (approximately 3%) that it has VERY LITTLE bearing on thematter, whereas, the amount of time (mentioned above) has a greatbearing.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://camillasenior.homestead.com/Part_2.Three_Short_Stories_and_activity.pdf<TEXT>  Maybe the summer season is your favorite time of year-school's out, the weather's warm-you might take a trip to the beach or hang out at your neighborhood pool. The fall season usually makes us think of leaves changing colors or the kick-off of a new football season. Then the winter months follow, bringing colder air and maybe snow for sledding or an icy pond for skating. Maybe spring is the season you look forward to the most! The blossoming trees and flowers can surely brighten things up after the drab, gray days of winter. All four of the seasons display their own unique characteristics, but what causes the change? 2     There are two things that cause the change in seasons: the earth's orbit (the path it travels around the sun), and the tilt of the earth's axis (which is at an angle of 23.5 degrees). 3     It takes the earth one year to make a single orbit (or revolution). At the same time the earth is revolving around the sun, it is also spinning (or rotating) on its axis. The earth completes one rotation every 24 hours. (Read about the earth's 24 time zones in "It's About Time.") 4     If you could stick a huge straight pin down through the North Pole and have it poke out through the South Pole, the pin would represent the earth's axis, but it would not be straight up and down. It would actually be slanted at an angle. The angle of the earth's axis is what causes different seasons. In summer, the earth is tipped toward the sun; in winter, it's tipped away. When it is summer in the northern hemisphere, it is winter in the southern.In summary, the reason for the seasons is the angle at which the sun's rays strike the earth, caused the by the tilt of the Earth on its axis. The tilt of the Earth also causes the change in the number of daylight hours experienced throughout the year.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.uen.org/Lessonplan/preview.cgi?LPid=2416<TEXT>Intended Learning Outcomes: *  Observe simple objects, patterns, and events, and report their observations. *   Plan and conduct simple experiments. *   Demonstrate a sense of curiosity about nature. *   Cite examples of how science affects life. Instructional Procedures: 1.   Take two round, hollow toilet paper tubes. 2.    Point one tube toward the sun at a 90  angle and the other tube at a 45  angle and allow the sunlight to strike the ground. 3.    Place a thermometer on the ground beneath each tube. 4.    Which ground will be hotter? The 90  angle tube will get more direct, concentrated heat and light energy. 5.    With the 45  angle tube, the light is spread out over a larger area, so the light and heat energy is not as concentrated. Extensions:Repeat the experiment with additional toilet paper tubes held at angles other than 90 and 45 degrees.Assessment Plan:Have students answer the question, "What is the relationship between the tilt of the Earth and the Earth's seasons? Assess their answers to check for understanding and possible misconceptions.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/env99/env212.htm<TEXT>The bottom line for the changes from season to season is the average daytime temperature. This depends on the amount of heating that the earth receives in a single day throughout the year, and this depends on how many hours the sun is above the horizon and exactly how long it spends at its highest elevation above the horizon. For every square meter on the surface of the earth, it will be heated by the sun at a rate that depends on the 'cosine' of the angle of the sun above the horizon.  The higher the sun gets, the less slanted the rays of light are that intercept each square meter, and so the efficiency with which these slanted rays can deliver energy to the surface gets better and better the higher up the sun gets. When you add up during the daylight hours just how much heating this surface gets, it receives most of its heating from those times during the day when the sun is the highest above the horizon. For a tilted earth, there will be some days during the year at a given latitude, where this heating rate is the highest and we call this summer. There will be other days when the sun never gets very high above the horizon and so its heating ability is very low, and we call this winter. The details of just how hot and cold we get, and the exact dates, depend also on whether we are near water, or in the interior of a continent.So, seasonal changes depend on the tilt of the earth's axis because they lead to changes in the amount of heat delivered to a square meter of surface, and the fact that there are a changing number of hours in the day when the sun is above the horizon and high enough up that it can efficiently heat the surface over the course of a typical day. The easiest way to visualize is to picture (or use a model of) the geometryof sun and earth, and pick a point on earth for different orientations ofthe axis and locations of the earth in its orbit around the sun.In the extreme case, imagine the case where the earth's axis was in thesame plane as the earth's orbit.  Once a year, the north pole woulddirectly face the sun, and 6 months later, the south pole would directlyface the sun.  At those times, the sun would stay almost exactly in thesame spot for the whole day for someone at the pole, and people in the>northern or southern hemisphere would see the sun travel in a circle at thesame height over the horizon.The effect on season would be most extreme at the poles- when facing thesun, that pole of earth would get direct sun continuously, about equal tobeing on the equator, but having no nighttime to cool off.  When facingaway from the sun, it would be similar to winters in the arctic orAntarctic circle, a continuous night.It would be catastrophic for life as we know it.  But not to fear, the typeof event that could change the axis that severely would be so catastrophicthat the change in seasons would be the least of our concerns. If the earthhad always had this different axis tilt, life on earth would be verydifferent, depending on where you lived.Catastrophic would be the word for it.  It is hard to guess what woulddevelop if the earth were to spin directly on its side.  One of the otherplanets - Uranus - does move like this.  Because its year is 84 earth yearslong, a point on Uranus has about 42 years of daylight and 42 years ofnight.  For the earth that would be about 180 of our present days for one"on-the-side" day.  It would likely mean the end of life on earth as we knowit.The earth is actually changing its inclination to the sun, but it is veryslight.  We say it is 23.5 degrees and that is pretty close.  There was atheory about 50 years ago that the earth would tip periodically and suddenlyto assume a new axis of rotation... but the new axis would be inclinedroughly 90 degrees.  I have heard nothing of this theory for many years.That is likely for failing under scientific scrutiny.Well, it WOULD make the weather quite unpleasant.  Just as now, the poleswould be in light for half the year and darkness for the other half.However, the intensity of the sunlight would vary much more dramaticallythan it does now.  At the solstice, the pole near the sun would experiencethe direct overhead rays of the sun, as the tropics do now.The rest of the planet would be both tropical and arctic;  tropical becausethe sun would appear to the north and to the south at different times of theyear, and arctic because the extreme periods of the year would involvecontinuous sunlight and continuous darkness, respectively.  At two timesduring the year, the sun would be directly overhead.  So the temperaturedifferences between summer and winter would be dramatic.  Every place wouldreceive intense sunlight when the sun is overhead.The most consistent location to be would be at the equator.  Things would beodd even here.  Only here would there be both day and night every day of theyear.  Day and night would be of equal length throughout the year, as it isnow.  At the equinoxes, the sun would be directly overhead.  At the twosolstices, the sun would be just at the horizon all day long, both day andnight.The best way to visualize this is with a globe.  You'll have to take it outof its stand, because globe stands typically are fixed at the natural angleof the earth's tilt.  Place the globe so that its polar axis is horizontalto the ground, and place a light source at the same height as the globe.The light shining on the globe will then model the sunlight illuminating theearth. As the earth rotates about its polar axis and revolves around thesun, you can see how the day/night pattern in various locations depends onthe time of year.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.anamp.org/nescp_curriculum/grade3_causes.html<TEXT>The seasons occur because the tilt of Earth's axis never changes while Earth orbits around the Sun. The north end of the axis always points in the same direction, almost directly to the North Star. On June 21, the North Pole is tilted toward the Sun and the Northern Hemisphere receives most of the sunlight. On or about December 21, the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun. At this time, the Northern Hemisphere receives the least amount of the sunlight. This is the start of winter in the Northern Hemisphere and the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. These times are called the summer and winter solstice.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.scienceu.com/observatory/articles/seasons/seasons.html<TEXT>Unless you live near the Earth's equator, you have no doubt noticed  that the weather changes during the year: it is hotter during the  Summer, colder in Winter, and somewhere in between during Spring and  Fall. These are the seasons, a regular change in  temperature, that repeat themselves every year, more or less regularly. What causes these changes? The Sun is our main source of heat, and  since these changes are the same every year, it surely has something  to do with the movement of the Earth around the Sun. If we get  closer to a fire, we get hotter. Could it be then that the Earth  gets closer to the Sun during Summer, and farther during Winter?   This idea seems at  first to have some merit, until we remember that the seasons get  reversed when we cross the equator: when it is Summer in the  northern hemisphere, it is Winter in the southern one, and vice versa. And surely Argentina is at the same distance from the Sun as the USA! Besides, that the Earth's orbit is an ellipse, not a circle, so that at some times the Earth is closer to the Sun than at others; but this ellipse is very nearly a circle, and the relatively small differences in distance to the Sun cannot account for the changes in temperature. And to make things worse, the Earth is closer to the Sun during the northern hemisphere Winter! What, then, is, the cause of the seasons? In the above animation, you can see the Earth during one full year (the animation then starts over again), as you would if you looked straight at it from the Sun. As you can see, the part of the Earth that is directly facing the sun changes with the time of the year. It is the northern half for a while, then moves south of the equator, only to move back to the north again. What causes this? The Earth rotates around an imaginary line passing through the poles, called the axis. This line forms an angle (called the tilt) of 23.4  with the perpendicular to the orbit of the Earth around the Sun. As the Earth moves around the Sun, this axis stays always pointing in the same direction. This means that, during part of the year, the northern part of the Earth will lean more directly against the sun, and during other parts the southern part will.  What has this to do with  temperature? Well, when the northern hemisphere is leaning away from  the sun, the rays coming from it hit this part of the Earth at a  smaller angle than on other parts of the world. This means that the  same amount of light is distributed over a larger surface, and  therefore these places receive less heat than the others. The  southern hemisphere is experiencing Summer, the northern hemisphere  Winter. In half a year, the situation reverses, and it is now Winter  in the southern hemisphere since that part of the earth is now  leaning away from the sun. The seasons are then the result of this tilt of the Earth's  axis. If the tilt of the Earth's axis was 0  there would be no difference in how the rays from the sun hit its different regions, and there would be no seasons. Not all planets have the same kind of tilt as the Earth has:  Uranus, for example, has a tilt of almost 98 . Its axis, then,  lies almost on the plane of its orbit, and a day there lasts about  as much as one year on Uranus: about 84 Earth-years.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/astronomy/planets/earth/Seasons.shtml<TEXT>The Earth's seasons are not caused by the differences in the distance from the Sun throughout the year (these differences are extremely small). The seasons are the result of the tilt of the Earth's axis. The Earth's axis is tilted from perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic by 23.45 . This tilting is what gives us the four seasons of the year, Summer, Spring, Winter and Autumn. Since the axis is tilted, different parts of the globe are oriented towards the Sun at different times of the year. Summer is warmer than winter (in each hemisphere) because the Sun's rays hit the Earth at a more direct angle during summer than during winter and also because the days are much longer than the nights during the summer. During the winter, the Sun's rays hit the Earth at an extreme angle, and the days are very short. These effects are due to the tilt of the Earth's axis.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.all-science-fair-projects.com/science_fair_projects/7/69/e2d2f603d72ece018b1025cf894b840d.html<TEXT>Lesson: The SeasonsObjectives: Demonstrate that seasons exist because of the tilt of the earth and its impact on the intensity of the sunlight at a given location. Introduction: Ask: "What are the different seasons? What are some differences and/or similarities between the seasons? Why are there seasons? What is the weather like during the different seasons? When you go to bed in the summer is it light or dark outside? When you go to bed in the winter is it light or dark outside?" Write the sequence of the seasons on the chalkboard for reference after the class answers the first question (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn). Body: 1.Ask for one volunteer to hold the globe and play the part of the earth (Atlas). Ask another volunteer to hold the flashlight and play the part of the sun (Helios, the god of the sun). The rest of the class should sit to one side so that they can clearly see Atlas and Helios at the same time. Have Atlas hold the earth straight up and down (teacher may assist). Now ask two more volunteers to tape the purple and pink person to the globe. The purple person should be taped midway between the equator and the pole. The pink person should be taped midway between the equator and the south pole. The teacher explains how the earth goes around the sun while Atlas and Helios demonstrate. Atlas walks around Helios while Helios keeps the flashlight pointed straight at the earth. The two should stand no further than 5-7 feet apart. Have Atlas stop when the purple person can see the sun. Ask Atlas if he/she can tilt the earth so that the sun is directly overhead of the purple person in the north. The rest of the class can help Atlas. Ask: "Is the sun bright or more direct for the purple person or the pink person? Do you think it is hotter for the purple person or the pink person?" Refer to Direct/Diffuse Light Lesson if needed. Now ask Atlas to tilt the earth so that the sun is directly overhead of the pink person. Ask: "Is the sun brighter or more direct for the purple person or the pink person? Do you think it is hotter for the purple or the pink person?" While Atlas has the sun over the pink persons head, the teacher helps the class find the point to which the north pole points in the classroom (wall, ceiling, etc.). Teacher tapes the black circle on the wall or ceiling as a reference point. Ask Atlas to orbit the sun (walk around the flashlight) keeping the north pole pointing at the black circle. Remember to have Helios keep his light pointed at the earth. Have the rest of the class help make sure Atlas doesn't change the tilt of the earth. Have Atlas stop after one-half of an orbit so that he is opposite of where he started. As the earth is orbiting the teacher explains that the earth is tilted one way and stays tilted the same way all the time. Ask a volunteer to come up and make it daytime for the pink and purple people. It should be night for them if Atlas has orbited correctly so the volunteer will have to spin the earth. Ask: "Is the sun more direct on the purple person or on the pink person? Is it hotter for the purple person or the pink person? Is it summer time or winter time for that person? (summer for the purple person) Is it summer or winter for the pink person?" Now have Atlas orbit the sun halfway around again making sure to keep the north pole pointed at the black circle. Ask a volunteer to make it daytime for the purple and pink people. Ask: "Is the sun more direct on the purple or the pink person? Is it hotter for the purple or the pink person? Who is it summertime for? Wintertime? How do you know that? Is the sun brighter or more concentrated for the person who is in summer or the person who is in winter?" At this point it is a good idea to point out that the seasons are opposite for people on the top (north) of the earth and on the bottom (south) of the earth. Ask: "When it is winter on the top (north) of the earth, what season is it on the bottom (south) of the earth? When it is winter on the bottom (south) of the earth, what season is it on the top (north) of the earth?" Teacher should repeat the orbit model as often as necessary, giving other volunteers the earth/sun responsibilities. Remove the pink person. Ask the students: "When is Autumn?" (refer to the sequence of seasons on the chalkboard; in between summer and winter) Have the class help position the earth so that it is summertime for the purple person, remembering to keep the north pole pointed at the reference point. Ask Atlas to orbit slowly toward the winter position. (Teacher and class can help.) Ask the class to help Atlas stop when it is autumn, halfway between summer and winter. Ask a volunteer to point on the globe where the sun is most direct. (equator) Have Atlas continue orbiting to the winter position. Ask the students: "When is Spring?" (refer to the sequence of seasons on the chalkboard; in between winter and summer). Ask Atlas to orbit slowly toward the summer position for purple person. Have the class help Atlas stop when it is spring for the purple person, halfway between winter and summer. Ask a volunteer to point on the globe where the sun is most direct (equator). Teacher should repeat this model as often as necessary giving other volunteers the chance to be Atlas and Helios.2. Before teaching this part of the lesson the teacher should prepare the Styrofoam ball earth model as follows: Insert a pencil through each of the Styrofoam balls so the pencil passes as close to the center of the ball as possible. The point that the pencil enters and leaves the Styrofoam ball is supposed to represent the north and south poles. Draw an equator around each earth model with a black magic marker. Divide the class into four groups. Pass out one earth model, one thumbtack and one flashlight to each group. If there are not enough flashlights available, then one group member can hold a yellow colored Styrofoam ball which will represent the sun. Have a member of each group push the thumbtack midway between the equator and a pole. Explain that the thumbtack represents a person. Have the groups practice modeling the different seasons. Allow enough time for each group to practice so that they will be able to model the different seasons for the rest of the class. Conclusion: Have each group model for the class the different seasons using their earth/sun models. The class can help correct any confused groups. This will also help the teacher assess how well the students understand the mechanisms which produce the seasons. Vocabulary Words: orbit north pole south pole equator Evaluation:1.

These changes are thought to affect the development of ice sheets. Although the idea that variation in the Earth's orbit causes glacial-interglacial cycles originated in the mid 1800s, Milutin Milankovitch first popularized it in about 1920. Although Milankovitch's hypothesis was not widely accepted at first; data collected during the 1970's have generated broad support for it. Three orbital parameters are especially important in causing ice sheet waxing and waning: Changes in the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit Changes in the tilt of the Earth's axis The precession of the equinoxes In combination these factors influence the amount and distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth. Changes vary with both latitude and season. Because of the different periodicities of variation for the three factors, the composite variations in solar radiation are very complex. Although the connections are not obvious and direct, changes in the amount of solar radiation are thought to drive the growth and melting of major ice sheets. Over the last 750,000 years ice sheets have expanded into the Midwestern United States at least 8 major times. The timing of some of these advances is not well known. The last glaciation of the Midwestern United States had its maximum extent approximately 20,000 years ago. The animals and plants discussed in this exhibit are the ones that were living in the Midwestern U.S. during and just following that glaciation. Eccentricity The Earth's orbit around the sun is not a circle, but rather it is an ellipse. The shape of the elliptical orbit, which is measured by its eccentricity, varies from between one and five percent through time. The eccentricity affects the difference in the amounts of radiation the Earth's surface receives at aphelion and at perihelion. The effect of the radiation variation is to change the seasonal contrast in the northern and southern hemispheres. For example, when the orbit is highly elliptical, one hemisphere will have hot summers and cold winters; the other hemisphere will have warm summers and cool winters. When the orbit is nearly circular, both hemispheres will have similar seasonal contrasts in temperature. Although the amount of change in radiation is very small (less than 0.2%), it is apparently extremely important in the expansion and melting of ice sheets. The eccentricity of the Earth's orbit varies in a periodic manner. The primary periodicity is approximately 100,000 years. Tilt The Earth's axis is tilted with respect to its orbit around the sun. Today the tilt is approximately 23.5 degrees. The tilt varies from between 21.6 and 24.5 degrees in a periodic manner. A graph of the tilt over the last 750,000 years shows that the dominant period of this variation is approximately 41,000 years. Changes in the tilt of the Earth's axis cause large changes in the seasonal distribution of radiation at high latitudes and in the length of the winter dark period at the poles. Changes in tilt have very little effect on low latitudes. The effects of tilt on the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth are closely linked to the effects of precession. Variation in these two factors cause radiation changes of up to 15% at high latitude. Radiation variation of this magnitude greatly influences the growth and melting of ice sheets. This graph shows the variation in the tilt of the Earth's axis over the last 750,000 years. The blue line traces the tilt. The orange line shows today's value for comparison. Precession of the equinoxes Twice a year, the equinoxes, the sun is positioned directly over the equator. Currently the equinoxes occur on approximately March 21 and September 21. However, because the Earth's axis of rotation "wobbles" (like a spinning top), the timing of the equinoxes changes . The change in the timing of the equinoxes is known as precession. Although the timing of the equinoxes is not in itself important in determining climate, the timing of the Earth's aphelion and perihelion also changes. Like the timing of the equinoxes, the timing of the aphelion and perihelion is also affected by the wobble of the axis of rotation. The changing aphelion and perihelion is important for climate because it affects the seasonal balance of radiation. For example, when perihelion falls in January the northern hemisphere winter and southern hemisphere summer are slightly warmer than the corresponding seasons in the opposite hemispheres. The aphelion and perihelion change position on the orbit through a cycle of 360 degrees. The cycle has two periods of approximately 19,000 and 23,000 years. Together these combine to produce a generalized periodicity of about 22,000 years. The effects of precession on the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth are closely linked to the effects of tilt. Variation in these two factors cause radiation changes of up to 15% at high latitude. Radiation variation of this magnitude greatly influences the growth and melting of ice sheets. The Last Ice Age The last Ice Age started about 70,000 years ago and ended about 10,000 years ago (during the Pleistocene epoch). The Earth was much colder than it is now; snow accumulated on much of the land, glaciers and ice sheets extended over large areas and the sea levels were lower. These phenomena changed the surface of the earth, forming lakes, changing the paths of rivers, eroding land, and depositing sand, gravel, and rocks along the glaciers' paths. Land at the Poles Antarctica has been located near the South Pole for about the last 300 million years! Regardless of temperatures, Earth's poles always have been colder than other locations on the globe. And they always have been subject to seasonal fluctuations in light and radiation. When a land mass lies in a polar position it forms an ideal spot to start an ice sheet, if the global temperatures are cool enough to support ice at the pole. What has added to the glaciation of Antarctica is the isolation of the continent from other land masses. The most recent phase of glaciation on Antarctica began about 40 million years ago as the other continents slowly separated from Antarctica. This allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to flow undeflected around Antarctica, isolating it from warmer water masses. Shift of the plates away from Antarctica (modified from Lawver et al., 1992). During the Cretaceous (110 million years ago). During the Oligocene (30 million years ago). Through time, Antarctica has been left behind at the South Pole and the ocean currents around the Southern Continent have strengthened to keep warmer waters from intruding. This has helped to maintain ice sheets on the continent for the last 40 million years. Tectonic Events Tectonic changes can cause changes in atmospheric circulation and oceanic circulation. These changes take place on time scales of millions of years. A tectonic shift is believed to have happened about 3.5 million years ago, when the Isthmus of Panama formed. The Isthmus cut off east-west ocean current circulation. This strengthened the Gulf Stream, which then delivered warmer water to the Northern Hemisphere. This warm water source increased precipitation over the North Pole region, resulting in the initiation of ice sheets in that region. Change in circulation. Before the formation of the Isthmus of Panama there was an east-west component of circulation, and the Gulf Stream was not as strong. Following formation of the Isthmus the Gulf Stream became stronger and carried warmer water closer to the pole. This caused an increase in precipitation. Earth's Orbit The Antarctic Ice Sheet has been in place for the last 40 million years, but it has grown and diminished in size several times since it's initiation. Likewise, the ice sheets of the Northern Hemisphere have grown and dispersed several times in the last 3.5 million years. Reorganization of Earth's surface components and location of the continents can set the stage for ice sheets. But what has caused the fluctuations of ice in the Northern Hemisphere and Antarctica? Many researchers believe that fluctuations in the volume of ice on Earth are caused by slight changes in the path of Earth around the sun. This causes a redistribution of solar radiation striking Earth's surface. The amount of incoming radiation has not changed. The changes in Earth's path can be broken into three components: Orbital Eccentricity - the path of Earth around the sun changes from being nearly circular, with the perihelion and aphelion being equal distance, to being more elliptical, with a difference in the perihelion and aphelion. These changes take place on a time scale of about 100,000 years, and probably are cause by the gravitational pull of Earth by other planets. Inclination - the tilt of Earth's axis changes through time. If the tilt is increased, there is an increase in the duration of winter darkness at the poles. The time scale for changes in tilt is about 41,000 years. Changes in axial tilt are most important at the poles. Precession of the Equinoxes - as Earth moves around the sun, it's path wobbles slightly because of the pull of the sun and the moon. This means that the poles are tilted toward the sun at different positions in the orbit. The Northern Hemisphere winter has not always occurred at aphelion, when Earth is farthest in its orbit from the sun. At times in the past, the Northern Hemisphere has tilted toward the sun at perihelion. Changes in Earth's orbit: orbital eccentricity, inclination or tilt, precession of the equinoxes (modified from Dawson, 1991). These slight changes in Earth's journey around the sun combine to cause changes in the distribution of solar radiation on Earth's surface. During times of the most elliptical path of Earth around the sun, the difference in winter and summer in the Northern Hemisphere are increased and the extremes in the seasons in the Southern Hemisphere are decreased. This could trigger the development of ice sheets close to the North Pole. When tilt of Earth's axis is greatest, there is an increase in the north-south atmospheric circulation, which causes an increase in the delivery of precipitation toward both poles. The predictable changes in Earth's orbit may act in concert with tectonic changes and the distribution of land over the globe. These shorter-time scale changes in orbit, which cause changes in the distribution of solar radiation across the globe, may help us understand why ice sheets have fluctuated in size in Antarctica during the last 40 million years, and why ice sheets have grown and decayed so many times in the Northern Hemisphere in the last 3.5 million years! Why were there four long, generally cool periods during which continent-sized glaciers advanced and retreated? Although scientists cannot answer this question with certainty, they know that a number of factors interact to produce conditions favoring the formation of ice sheets. Some of these factors include changing continental positions uplift of continental blocks reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere changes in the Earth's orbit Long ice age intervals did not just suddenly occur. Instead, they seem to have been the culmination of even longer periods of worldwide climatic cooling. This cooling took place for tens of millions of years before the beginning of glaciation. Once ice sheets start to grow, they probably contribute to their own further development. This positive feedback occurs because ice sheets reflect more sunlight back into space than does ground not covered by ice. The reflected sunlight would otherwise warm the Earth's surface. Consequently, the presence of ice sheets may lead to more cooling and continued development of ice sheets. Changing continental positions Plate tectonics is an important process influencing when ice ages occur, and the position of the continents is probably one of the most important factors controlling long periods of multiple glaciations. The presence of large land masses at high latitude appears to be a prerequisite for the development of extensive ice sheets, because the large accumulations of ice associated with ice sheets cannot form over the ocean. During the current ice age, which began slightly less than 3 million years ago, several large land masses have been at high latitude. These include Antarctica, much of North America and much of Eurasia. This continental configuration led to extensive glaciation of both North America and Eurasia. During the ice age that occurred in the Pennsylvanian and Permian, the southern portion of the supercontinent Pangaea was at the south pole. The result was extensive glaciation of what is now Africa, South America, India, Antarctica, Australia, and the Arabian peninsula. The position of the continents during the Late Proterozoic glaciation (around 700 million years ago) is not well-known. Evidence of glaciers exists from North America, Australia, and Africa. Uplift of continental blocks Plate tectonics probably contributes to the development of long periods with many glaciations in a second, more subtle way. Plate movements sometimes cause uplift of large continental blocks. Major uplift can cause profound changes in the global oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns. Changing circulation patterns cause climate change. Some scientists hypothesize that climatic changes cause by uplift are critical to the development of ice ages. Over the past 15 million years, the continents have risen about 600 meters (2000 feet) on average. The uplift of the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau probably contributed to the initiation of the current cool period. Similar tectonic uplift appears to have been involved in the three other long, ice age intervals. Reduction of CO2 in the atmosphere A general reduction in amount of CO2 in the atmosphere may contribute to the development of ice ages. Carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas. Decreases in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere may lead to global cooling. Many processes can cause a long-term decrease in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. These processes include many complex interactions among organisms, ocean currents, erosion, and volcanism. Important relationships exist between ice ages and the composition of the atmosphere; however, many scientists are unsure whether the changes in atmosphere cause cool periods or whether cool periods cause atmospheric changes. Also, many scientists are not sure the magnitude of past CO2 changes was large enough to initiate ice ages. Changes in the Earth's orbit The Earth's orbit varies through time. Important parameters that vary include the eccentricity of the orbit around the sun, the tilt of the Earth's axis, and the direction the north pole points. Variation in these three factors changes the amount and distribution of incoming solar radiation. Variations in the distribution of solar radiation affects and initiates glaciations. However, the variation of the orbital parameters seems to be on too short a time scale to explain the timing of the long, cool intervals with many glaciations. Variations in orbital factors are probably more important in controlling the advance and retreat of large glaciers during the four long, cool periods than they are for controlling the larger-scale patterns. 1) What causes the long-term changes leading to an ice age? Factors that are thought to play important roles in long-term changes in Earth's climate over millions or tens of millions of years are Changes in the positions of the continents Variations in the energy output of the sun Changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration Changes in volcanic activity Influence of the biosphere   2) What causes the glacial cycles within an ice age? During an ice age, the shorter-term cycles of advancing and retreating glaciers are thought to be driven by regular, predictable variations in Earth's orbit and orientation relative to the Sun. How do we know that ice ages occurred? The idea that an ice age had occurred in the past was first proposed by Louis Agassiz in the early 1800s. Agassiz noted that the slow action of mountain glaciers in Switzerland produced certain kinds of features in the surrounding landscape. These include glacial till and erratics, rock striations and loess. He also noted that these features sometimes occurred in areas far from the mountains, where no glaciers existed. Based on these observations, Agassiz came up with the idea that extensive glaciers had existed in the past. Scientific progress since the time of Agassiz has not only confirmed his idea, but has also begun to reveal a much more detailed picture of what conditions were like during the last ice age. To obtain a more detailed picture of the last ice age, scientists study natural recorders of climate change, such as fossil pollen, ancient coral reefs, ocean sediments and ice cores. If a planetary body was to come into contact with the orbital motion of earth or Mobius Ice ages happen for various reasons two being the orbit and tilt of the planet. But the question is if we came into contact with another planet would that bring about an ice age. This reason why I asked this is the planet Nibiru comes into orbits very close to ours and Mobius's orbit pattern ever 3600 years. But because of our collision with Orpheus millions of years ago and the splitting of the two planets and the reforming of both earth and the new planetary body Mobius our sister planet and the newly formed moon our orbit in slightly of from what in was in the days when Orpheus was our planetary neighbor how the big question is if Nibiru was to pass the earth or Mobius, would the pull of the planetary body be enough to tilt the earths or Mobius Axis the answer to this would be yes the drag would tilt the planetary body to what degree is not known at this time but a tilt of that magnitude would through the planetary body into a cataclysmic event that would because the next ice age on earth or Mobius. The image below show the possible affect of Nibiru passing closely by the Earth The same would apply for Mobius if it was to be near Nibiru when it entered into our orbitational flow other times in the cycle of Nibiru orbit around the sun neither planet would be near Nibiru as it passed through the inner planets as it made it way around the sun. The only question left is where is earth and Mobius in there orbitational cycles in relation to Nibiru orbitational cycle? </TEXT></DOC><DOC>??? can't source this<TEXT>Background: Earth's Tilt Causes the Seasons  Seasons are a result of Earth's tilt on its axis as it revolves around the sun. Because of its curved surface and tilt, different parts of Earth receive more direct sunlight during different parts of the year. As Earth makes its annual rotation around the sun, the sun's rays shine on Earth's surface in varying degrees and at different angles, causing the seasons to change. The sun's rays are more direct and intense near Earth's equator, and less direct and concentrated at its polar caps. This is why the Northern Hemisphere, the part of Earth's surface north of the equator, has winter while the Southern Hemisphere, the half of Earth's surface south of the equator, experiences summer. Seasons in the two hemispheres are opposite because while one hemisphere is directly facing the sun, the other is tilted away from it.  Opening Discussion: Seasonal Changes  To start students thinking about what causes the seasons to change, ask them what they know about seasons and how their lives are affected by seasonal changes. Discuss Earth's orbit and show that while Earth's distance from the sun varies at different times of the year, it is Earth's tilt on its axis that causes the seasons to change. Have students write down their answers for later use.  Activity: Flashlight Tag  Overview:  Explore the effects of light on a curved surface.  Materials: bright flashlight, large sheet of white paper attached to a box lid, globe, colored markers  What to do:  1.    With the room darkened, have a student shine the flashlight directly on the white paper. Ask a volunteer to trace the circle formed by the light with a colored marker. 2.    Without moving the flashlight, slightly tilt the box lid away from the light source. Have a student trace this area with a different colored marker. Compare the two shapes. Discuss which one represents summer, with more direct heat from the sun, and which one represents winter, with diffused heat. 3.    Ask students to design a similar demonstration using a tilted globe. Encourage them to locate their own community on the globe. 4.    Ask volunteers to demonstrate summer and winter in the Northern Hemisphere and explain how Earth's tilt relates to seasonal changes. Assessment  Review the answers students gave in the Now Boarding section. Have students note how accurate their initial explanations were. Confirm and build upon students' understanding of what causes the seasons to change by asking them to consider the following scenarios:  *   What if Earth were a flat surface? *   What if Earth were round but not tilted on its axis? *   What if Earth were stationary? *   What would happen if Earth circled the sun twice as often? *   What if Earth were tilted so the North Pole faced the sun? Answers should reflect the drastic seasonal changes that would occur in each situation. Students should understand that a combination of factors causes predictable seasonal changes to occur and that because the changes are predictable, we can plan activities and make necessary adjustments in our lives.  </TEXT></DOC><DOC>??Can't source this<TEXT>The Arts: Seasonal Images  Seasonal changes have a great impact on humans, and people have expressed an appreciation for these changes in many different ways. Poetry is one art form through which people have conveyed their feelings about seasonal changes. Have students explore books of poetry such as Poetry for Young People: Robert Frost, edited by Gary Schmidt, and Voices of the Wind, selected by David Booth, to see how the beauty of and an appreciation for the seasons are captured. Students may choose to create their own poems. In either case, have them determine whether the poems include a description of what causes seasonal changes (such as the effect of the sun and/or Earth's tilt and curve) and, if so, identify the description.Day and night lengths vary throughout the year because of the orientation of Earth's tilted spin axis in relationship to the Sun. Associated changes in solar energy input to each hemisphere cause seasons. In the northern hemisphere, summer begins at the summer solstice when the north pole is titled toward the Sun. Winter in the northern hemisphere begins when the north pole is oriented away from the Sun, around December 21. In both hemispheres, day and night lengths are equal on two days each year, the autumnal and vernal equinoxes.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.koshland-science-museum.org/exhibitgcc/causes08.jsp<TEXT>Slow changes in the Earth's orbit lead to small but climatically important changes in the strength of the seasons over tens of thousands of years. Climate feedbacks amplify these small changes, thereby producing ice ages. Eccentricity Earth's orbit oscillates very slightly between nearly circular and more elongated every 100,000 years. This cycle is evident in the glacial/interglacial cycles of roughly the same period. Orbital Eccentricity The Earth's orbital path varies in the degree to which it is circular. This change in its "eccentricity" varies between 0.00 and 0.06 on a 100,000 year cycle. When the eccentricity equals 0.00 the orbital path is circular and when it is 0.06 the orbital path is slightly elliptical. The current value is 0.0167. TiltThe Earth spins around an axis that is tilted from perpendicular to the plane in which the Earth orbits the Sun. This tilt causes the seasons. At the height of the Northern Hemisphere winter the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun, while in the summer it is tilted toward the Sun. The angle of the tilt varies between 22  and 24.5  on a cycle of 41,000 years. When the tilt angle is high, the polar regions receive less solar radiation than normal in winter and more in summer.Earth's Tilt The Earth is tilted from perpendicular in its orientation to the Sun. This tilt varies from 22  to 24.5  on a 41,000 year cycle. The current tilt is 23.3 . Wobble There is a slow wobble in the Earth's spin axis, which causes the peak of winter to occur at different points along the Earth's elliptical orbital path. This variation in the seasons occurs on an approximately 23,000-year cycle.Wobble of the Earth's Spin AxisThe Earth's axis of rotation wobbles like a top on a 23,000 year cycle. This causes the Earth's seasons to reach their maximum at different distances from the Sun due to the elliptical shape of the Earth's orbit. </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://physics.ship.edu/~mrc/astro/NASA_Space_Science/observe.arc.nasa.gov/nasa/education/teach_guide/seasons.html<TEXT>Plane of the Ecliptic Model This model will help students understand that the orbit of the Earth remains in a fixed plane as it revolves around the Sun. The objective of this investigation is to show students that the centers of the Earth and Sun remain in the same plane during the orbit. It is important that students understand how the combination of the plane of the ecliptic and the tilt of the Earth's axis produces seasons.Assemble the model in front of the class so they can get an understanding of the components involved. Ask a student from the class to help assemble the model. Have the student hold one end of the fishing line. Tie the other end to the paperclip and place the "hook" into the orange ball. Now you have your Sun. Next, use the pliers and twist the wire around the string just above the orange ball. The wire simulates the plane of the ecliptic. Twist the other end of the wire into a small circle. Place the second wire through the small circle and twist it 360 degrees. Insert the two ends of the wire into the blue Styrofoam ball at an angle close to 23.5 degrees. Now you have your axis. Make sure that the center of the Sun (orange ball) and the center of the Earth (blue ball) are in the same plane.Now it's time to use your model. Show the class how the centers of the Earth and the Sun remain in the same plane during the orbit (counterclockwise). You can have your helper make the Earth revolve around the Sun as you simulate the rotation of the Earth's axis (counterclockwise) during the orbit.The Sun, the Earth, and the Axis Using a globe and a small flashlight is a great way for students to learn about the relationship between the Sun, the Earth, and the 23.5 degree tilt of the Earth's axis. It's a good idea to use a  small flashlight so the light is more concentrated on the globe.Have the students gather around a central table and outline an orbit with the masking tape. Ask two students from the class to help with this experiment and turn out the lights. Have one of the students slowly trace the orbit with the globe as you keep the flashlight shining on it from a fixed position. Have the other student slowly rotate the globe about its axis (counterclockwise) as it continues on its orbit.From this model you should explain the difference between indirect and direct rays, pinpoint the equinoxes and solstices, and observe how the orbit impacts the North and South Poles.What causes Earth's seasons?  </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3077384/ (not exactly, but close)<TEXT>The tilt of our planet dictates the cycle of summer and winter Sept. 23 -  The seasons are a powerful force in our lives. They affect the activities we do, the foods we crave, the clothes we wear - and quite often, the moods we are in. On Tuesday, autumn fell upon the Northern Hemisphere, while spring has sprung in the Southern Hemisphere. What is it that causes the change in seasons?  Different hemispheres are exposed to different amounts of sunlight throughout the year.          THE ABILITY to predict the seasons - by tracking the rising and setting points of the sun throughout the year - was key to survival in ancient times. Babylonians, Mayans and other cultures developed complex systems for monitoring seasonal shifts. But it took centuries more to unravel the science behind the seasons.        Nicolai Copernicus (1473-1543) radically changed our understanding of astronomy when he proposed that the sun, not Earth, was the center of the solar system. This led to our modern understanding of the relationship between the sun and Earth. We now know that Earth orbits the sun elliptically and, at the same time, spins on an axis that is tilted relative to its plane of orbit. This means that different hemispheres are exposed to different amounts of sunlight throughout the year. Because the sun is our source of light, energy and heat, the changing intensity and concentration of its rays give rise to the seasons of winter, spring, summer and fall.        The seasons are marked by solstices and equinoxes - astronomical terms that relate to Earth's tilt.          The solstices mark the points at which the poles are tilted at their maximum toward or away from the sun. This is when the difference between the daylight hours and the nighttime hours is most acute. The solstices occur each year on June 20 or 21 and Dec. 21 or 22.        The vernal equinox and autumnal equinox herald the beginning of spring and fall. At these times of the year, the sun appears to be directly over Earth's equator, and the lengths of the day and the night are equal over most of the planet.        On March 20 or 21 of each year, the Northern Hemisphere is reaching the vernal equinox and enjoying the signs of spring. At the same time, the winds are turning cold in the Southern Hemisphere as the autumnal equinox sets in.        On Sept. 22 or 23 of each year, it's the other way around: Summer fades to fall in the north, and winter's chill starts giving way to spring in the south. This year, the September equinox occurred at 6:47 a.m. ET Sept. 23. That was the moment when the sun was precisely over the equator. Here's how the seasonal change affects the weather: Around the time of the June solstice, the North Pole is tilted toward the sun and the Northern Hemisphere is starting to enjoy summer. The sun's rays are strong because they are directly overhead. They are concentrated over a smaller surface area and traveling through a relatively small amount of energy-absorbing atmosphere before striking the earth.        At the same time that the Northern Hemisphere is entering summer, the South Pole is tilted away from the sun, and the Southern Hemisphere is starting to feel the cold of winter. The sun's rays are weak because they are spread over a greater surface area and must travel through more energy-absorbing atmosphere to before reaching the earth.        The situations are reversed in December, when it's the Southern Hemisphere that basks in the most direct rays of the sun, while the Northern Hemisphere receives the weakest rays.        Although the solstices represent the pinnacles of summer and winter with respect to the intensity of the sun's rays, they do not represent the warmest or coldest days. This is because temperature depends not only on the amount of heat the atmosphere receives from the sun, but also on the amount of heat it loses due to the absorption of this heat by the ground and ocean. It is not until the ground and oceans absorb enough heat to reach equilibrium with the temperature of the atmosphere that we feel the coldest days of winter or hottest days of summer.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>???<TEXT> First, the tilt of the axis means the sun is higher in the sky  in summer and lower in the sky in winter. This affects the angle of  the incident sunlight. Sunlight hitting the Earth at a smaller angle  spreads the same amount of energy over a larger area Figure 2: The angle at which sunlight strikes the ground tells us how  well it will heat the surface. Sunlight with a low angle (wintertime)  spreads the same amount of energy over a much larger area, so it is  not as efficient at heating the surface as when the Sun is higher in the sky. 2.   Second, during the summer months the days are longer, so there is more  time each day for the Sun to deliver heat. During the winter, the days  are short, and the sun delivers less heat to the surface.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/seasons.html<TEXT> How it works: This is one of the most pernicious types of ideas: one that sounds reasonable, and so it propagates easily. Unfortunately, it's wrong. Well, not completely wrong; certainly the Earth's distance from the Sun has something to do with the temperature, but it is a relatively minor effect. First, a sanity check: The Earth's orbit is an ellipse. The Earth reaches perihelion (the point in its orbit closest to the Sun) in January, and it reaches aphelion (farthest point from the Sun) some six months later. If that were all that governed weather, we'd have summer in January, and Winter in July! This may be true for our Southern Hemisphere friends, but not up in the North. Something else must be going on. We can check our qualitative conclusion above with some (simple!) math. The math involved in calculating a planet's gross temperature has been known for a long time. Basically, the temperature depends only weakly on distance changes; the temperature goes as the inverse square root of the distance of the planet to the Sun. What does that mean? In other words, if you double the distance of a planet from the Sun, the temperature will drop by the square root of 2, or about 1.4. Doubling the Earth's distance from the Sun will drop the mean temperature by about 80 degrees Celsius (Careful here! You cannot use Celsius units for the actual calculation. You have to use the Kelvin scale, which has the same units as Celsius, but starts at 0. In other words, 0K = -273 C. If you take the square root of the temperature using Celsius you'll get the wrong answer! However, since the units are the same, an 80 degree drop is the same in both scales). Specifically, the Earth's average temperature is about 280 degrees Kelvin (10 Celsius). 280/1.4=200, or a drop of 80 degrees.there was no tilt in the earth's axis we not only wouldn't have any seasons, but nearly every place on earth would receive the same amount of sunlight energy each day, for each year, for the rest of eternity.  Sounds boring.   However, let us rejoice, let in the jesters and bring me your finest meats and beverages, for there is a tilt of the earth's axis and life is good!       The earth receives varying amounts of solar energy due to this tilt in the earth's axis and the earth's orbit around the sun.  This variation in sunlight and thus varying seasons, is overwhelmingly due to the tilt in the earth compared to the distance of the earth from the sun.   The varying amount of solar energy is the key to our varying weather.  Since sunlight is the energy that drives our weather, heats our atmosphere, grows our food,  evaporates water, gives us nice tans and in some cases helps run our cars, the amount of sunlight energy reaching us will greatly affect not only our weather, but our economy and ultimately our lives.   Why do we have varying amounts of sunlight? Notice on the equinoxes the daylight is distributed evenly.  However, on the solstices the daylight is greater in one of the two hemispheres (northern or southern) due to the tilt.  You see, the earth is tilted from it's axis because it got hit by meteoroids and other stuff when the planets first formed (or at least that's what scientists think).  So, as the tilted earth orbits the sun, sometimes it is tilted toward the sun and sometimes away from the sun (remember northern hemisphere perspective).  The transition in between is the equinox and the earth is neither tilted toward nor away from the sun.      When the earth is tilted toward the sun, the northern hemisphere will receive more sunlight energy per unit of area. How does this work you say? If you hold  a flashlight close to a piece of paper, the light is bright and concentrated in a relatively small circle (figure 1). But when you tilt the paper (ahhh...like the earth is tilted) the light is less intense and not as bright, as it is spread out over a large area (figure 2).  So when earth is tilted towards the sun, it's like figure 1, we get more concentrated sun light energy. In figure 2 the same amount of light is there, but it has to be shared by the areas of the paper...it's spread out. That's like our winter, and it is caused because the earth is tilted away from the sun, just like the paper is tilted away from the flashlight.           Concentrated, more energy per unit area                 Diffuse and less energy per unit of area (Notice that in this analogy it was irrelevant how far the flashlight is from the paper. Similarly, the distance of the earth from the sun is irrelevant too, although it does have a small impact on the heating of the earth.) So the sunlight is more concentrated when the earth is tilted towards the sun (thus summer), but wait! Order now, operators are holding, and you will get this other reason!!!! Another side effect of the tilt is that our northern hemisphere stays in the daylight region for a longer period during the summer (see below). This is why summer days in Iowa for example, can have 12-15 hours of daylight compared to winter days of 9-12 hours of daylight. Thus, summer days being longer means there is more time for the sun to heat things up. This is why summer is hot and winter is cold...and remember...it all is caused by the fact that our earth has a tilt. Sometimes that tilt is towards the sun (summer) and sometimes the tilt is away from the sun (winter). Please remember, we are speaking in a northern hemisphere perspective here. Notice how much of the northern hemisphere is in the daylight in the summer figure compared to the winter figure  Summer = More Sunlight & More Concentrated                           Winter = Less Sunlight & less Concentrated At perihelion (nearest point) the Earth/Sun distance is about 147,000,000 km, and at aphelion (farthest point) it's about 152,000,000 km. The change in temperature is then     square root( 152,000,000 / 147,000,000 ) =1.017 or just less than 2 percent. This turns out to be only 5 degrees Celsius, which is quite a bit less than the temperature change we see between winter and summer. Obviously, something else must be going on. The largest contributor to the change in seasons is the tilt, or inclination, of the Earth's spin axis with respect to its orbital plane (the ecliptic). The usual explanation is as follows: take a flashlight and a piece of paper. Shine the light straight onto the paper, so you see an illuminated circle. All the light from the flashlight is in that circle. Now slowly tilt the paper, so the circle elongates into an ellipse. All the light is still in that ellipse, but the ellipse is spread out over more paper. The density of light drops. In other words, the amount of light per square centimeter drops (the number of square centimeters increases, however, so the total amount of light stays the same-- you expect that, as the light from the flashlight has not changed). The same is true on the Earth. When the Sun is overhead, the light is falling straight on you, and so more light (and more heat) hit each square centimeter of the ground. When the Sun is low, the light gets more spread out over the surface of the Earth, and less heat (per square centimeter!) can be absorbed. Since the Earth's axis is tilted, the Sun is higher when you are on the part of the Earth where the axis points towards the Sun, and lower on the part of the Earth where the axis points away from the Sun. For the Northern Hemisphere, the axis points most toward the Sun in June (specifically, around June 21), and away from the Sun on December 21. This corresponds to the Winter and Summer Solstices, or the midpoints of summer and winter. For the Southern Hemisphere, this is reversed.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.uen.org/Lessonplan/preview.cgi?LPid=626 (a partial repeat0<TEXT>Why isn't the Earth's distance a factor in explaining the causes of the changing seasons? The most important reason is that the Earth's orbit or path around the sun is almost circular. The distance of the Earth from the sun does change, but it is so slight that it makes very little difference in the heat energy felt on the Earth. For example, if you were sitting 30 meters from the fireplace and moved 30 centimeters closer, you would not feel that much warmer than what you felt before. Therefore, it is not the Earth's distance from the sun that causes the change in our seasons. What causes the changes in the seasons on Earth? The two things that make an impact on the seasons are the angle of the Sun above the horizon and how long the sun stays in the sky at a given latitude (the amount of daylight). When the sun is most nearly overhead, the ground gets the hottest. At noon, the sun is at an angle that is most nearly vertical. At sunrise or sunset, the angle from the horizon is smaller so the ground is cooler. When daylight lasts longer, there is more time for the sun to warm the ground each day. The angle above the horizon at noontime is important because it determines how much concentrated light and energy the Earth receives at a specific point. An area that receives more light more directly overhead, gets the hottest. Also, the longer the sun is above the horizon on a given day, the longer it will radiate light and energy. This factor is not nearly as important as the angle of the sun above the horizon. To help illustrate this idea, take two round, hollow toilet paper tubes. Point one tube toward the sun at a 90  angle and the other tube at a 45  angle and allow the sunlight to strike the ground. Which ground will be hotter? The 90  angle tube will get more direct, concentrated heat and light energy. With the 45  angle tube, the light is spread out over a larger area, so the light and heat energy is not as concentrated. This illustration demonstrates the sun's affect because of the Earth's tilt. </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.ecology.com/features/tiltingearth/index.html (close)<TEXT>On January 4, 2004, at 1:00 PM (Eastern Time), Earth will reach its closest distance to sun. At this time, the northern hemisphere experiences winter while the southern hemisphere experiences summer.  The Earth will travel to its farthest point from the sun on July 5, 2004, at about 6:00 AM (ET), when it will  be summer in the Northern Hemisphere and winter in the Southern Hemisphere. Earth travels around the Sun at about 18.4 miles per second while rotating on its axis at about 1,070 miles per hours. Pictured above is Earth during summer for the Northern Hemisphere where the North Pole (center of the Arctic Ice Cap) receives sunlight 24 hours a day. (Image: University of Toledo) Hurtling through space at an average speed of 18.4 miles per second, Earth is constantly changing its position with the sun. Not only is the Earth orbiting around the sun , but it also rotating  on its axis at 1,070 miles per hour (speed at the equator). It is, however, a common misconception that the Earth's distance from the sun determines how warm or cold the planet gets. While it is true that Earth does have a perihelion, or point at which it is closest to the sun, and an aphelion, its farthest point from the sun, the difference between these distances is too minimal as to have any significant impact on the Earth's seasons and climate. The average distance of the Earth from the sun is about 93 million miles (which is also referred to as one astronomical unit or AU). At its closest point, the Earth is about 91.1 million miles from the sun; conversely, the sun is about 94.8 million miles away when it is at aphelion. With these numbers it's easy to figure out that the Earth's orbit around the sun is not so much elliptical (oval) as it is circular, and that the Earth's distance from the sun remains relatively constant throughout its annual orbit.So what does the Earth's orbit around the sun have to do with our planet's constantly changing temperatures and changing seasons? The answer is... everything! Earlier we said that the Earth is constantly changing its position with the sun. That's because the Earth is tilted in relation to the sun. That is what creates the differences in the seasons and the annual warming and cooling cycles of the Earth's Northern and Southern Hemispheres.If the Earth was not Tilted....If the Earth's axis were parallel to the Sun and not tilted, the Sun would remain positioned exactly halfway between the North and South Poles, and there would be no seasonal changes on Earth. Each area on Earth would maintain the same relative climate and same amount of daylight throughout the entire year.  The Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees on its axis, a straight line through the planet from the North Pole to the South Pole. The Earth spins around, or rotates, on this axis as it orbits the sun. The key here is that as the Earth orbits the sun, different regions on Earth are tilted both towards and away from the sun depending on the region's respective hemisphere. This causes the sun's light and energy to hit the different regions of the Earth at different angles throughout the course of one orbit, or one full year. The SeasonsWhen the North Pole is tilted most toward the sun, the Northern Hemisphere experiences summer. This occurs when the Earth is farthest away from the sun, and begins on June 21-22. Astronomers refer to the arrival of this event as the Summer Solstice. The sun's energy is more concentrated on the Northern Hemisphere where its rays hit the Earth more directly and are thus more intense. At the same time, however, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun causing the sun's rays to hit the region more at an angle and with less intensity. This brings about winter in the Southern Hemisphere, the arrival of which is called the Winter Solstice.This diagram indicates the orbital position of the Earth as it reaches winter, spring, summer and fall. Note the tilt in relation to the Sun. (NOAA Image As the Earth continues along its path around the sun, its angle constantly shifts the North Pole away from the sun and the South Pole toward the sun. On December 21-22 -- called the Winter Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, the Earth's North Pole is tilted farthest from the sun and the South Pole is pointed the closest to the sun (or Summer Solstice in the Southern Hemisphere). This is also the time when Earth reaches its closest orbital distance to the sun, and winter arrives in the north and summer in the south.The EquinoxesNow, just to close the loop on the effects Earth's solar orbit has on its seasons and climates, here's what happens in-between the winter and summer solstices. Spring and Fall (or Autumn) occur midway on the Earth's journey from winter to summer and from summer to winter. These times occur when the sun appears to be directly over the Earth's equator, and the length of day and night are equal over most of the planet. On March 20 or 21 of each year, the Earth reaches the vernal equinox which marks the arrival of Spring in the north and Fall in the south. The autumnal equinox occurs on September 22-23 and marks the arrival of Fall in the north and Spring in the south.Putting It All TogetherSo, now, what do we know? Let's review. We now know that Earth rotates on its axis as it travels around the sun in an almost circular orbit. We also know that, because the Earth is tilted on its axis, its seasons change as it orbits the sun. When it is Summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is Winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and this has nothing to do with how close or far the Earth gets to or away from the Sun in its orbit. It's all because the Earth is tilted on its axis. (Now, just to make sure we don't mislead you, the Earth's overall orbit or distance from the sun would make a difference if it were located say where Mercury is or where Pluto is. As Dr. Jack Hall from ecology.com's Dr. Jack's Natural World says: "It's the three bears syndrome. We're not too close to the sun, and we're not too far away. We're j-u-u-u-u-st right!)Venus' surface (pictured) maintains an average temperature of about 882 F due to the extremely high concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in its atmosphere. CO2 is a greenhouse gas that also exists in Earth's atmosphere but at lower concentration levels that help maintain life-sustaining temperatures. (NASA photo) Good! But this does not explain why our planet maintains its relatively warm, life-sustaining temperatures and climates that can -- for the most part -- sustain life, does it? It also does not explain why life on Earth doesn't burn up. For Earth to maintain its average temperature of 61 F (16.1 C), it requires a very delicate balance within its atmosphere, oceans and solid Earth. Consider the planet Mercury, which is the planet closest to the Sun at a distance of only 36 million miles. But its temperatures range from minus 280 F to plus 800 F, depending on whether or not its surface is facing the Sun. Venus, on the other hand -- which is the second closest planet to the Sun at a distance of about 67 million miles, maintains an average surface temperature of about 882 F regardless of which part of the planet is facing the Sun. Neither planet is able to sustain life as we know it on Earth, nor is any other planet in our solar system.The Sahara Desert, pictured, records the hottest temperatures on Earth. Located in the northern part of Africa, the Sahara's highest temperatures average around 130 F. Earth's... coldest temperature averages about minus 60 F (-45 F to -97 F) and its hottest temperature averages about 130 F-plus. While these extremes make most life impossible to naturally exist or thrive, they occur only in remote areas of the planet, such as the Antarctic (coldest average temperatures) or the Sahara Desert (hottest). Still, these temperatures are relatively warm (or cool) compared to other planets. Earth's "Checks & Balances"Earth has a built-in, naturally-occurring "force field" around it that creates and helps maintain viable living conditions for its plant and animal inhabitants. The atmosphere contains greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide to keep the Earth warm, and an ozone layer to protect the Earth from harmful and incinerating (burning) radiation. The Earth also has other checks and balances that help it absorb and retain the sun's heat and energy (such as the oceans) as well as reflect its energy back into space (such as the polar ice caps). Wind and ocean currents also help distribute this heat around the globe, all within the Earth's protective atmosphere. The point is that Earth is unique in its ability to create and maintain sustainable living conditions because all of its systems and influences are connected to each other, from its atmosphere, oceans and land, to its seasons, its living inhabitants and the sun.Venus' extremely hot temperature exists because of the very high concentrations of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) in its atmosphere. In fact, Venus has the thickest atmosphere of all the planets. Heat gets in, but doesn't leave. Mercury, on the other hand, has no atmosphere and relies totally on direct sunlight for heat. But the side of Mercury facing away from the sun, which experiences extreme cold, loses all this heat because there is nothing there to hold it in. Earth's systems are j-u-u-u-u-st right! (Eric McLamb)Did you know....? *  The  hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth is 136 F in El Azizia, Libya, in Northern Africa on the northern fringe of the Sahara Desert. A close second is Death Valley in California's Mojave Desert which registered 134 F on July 10, 1913. (Source: The Physics Factbook) *  The coldest temperature ever recorded on the planet's surface did not occur at the South Pole but at Vostok, Antarctica, on July 31, 1983.  It was -128.6 F!!!

The frozen continent of Antarctica, the coldest place on Earth, is so dry that some scientists consider it a desert, too. *  Our solar system orbits around the center of the Milky Way, our home galaxy. It takes approximately 225 million years for the sun to make one revolution or trip around the Milky Way. (Source: US Department of Energy) *  The speed of the Earth is fastest when it is closest to the Sun, in January, and slowest when it is farthest away from the sun, in July. In other words, in January it will be moving faster than average, and in July it will be moving slower than average. *  Earth's solar system is located on the outer edge on the Milky Way, about 28,000 light years from the center of the galaxy. Most of the Milky Way's 200 billion other stars and their planets are clustered in the center. This leads many scientists to believe that if the solar system were located more toward the center of our giant galaxy, life on Earth would be impossible because of the overwhelming heat and energy emitting from those stars. *   Although most planets spin on their axis that are tilted only a few degrees, the third largest planet, Uranus, spins on an axis that is virtually perpendicular to the sun. Still, it is hotter at its equator than at its poles, the reasons for which are unknown. * All planets in the solar system orbit around the sun in the same plane, called the ecliptic. Only Pluto moves the most off of the ecliptic plane at a 17  angle, but Mercury also moves away from the ecliptic plane at a 7  angle.(Discovering the Universe, 5th ed., *1-4, *1-6)</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.opencourse.info/astronomy/introduction/03.motion_earth/<TEXT> *  We now know that the diurnal motion of the stars and the Sun is due to the Earth's rotation.   In addition, the movement of the Sun along the ecliptic is actually because of the Earth's revolution around the Sun.   *  Let's now consider the point of view where we are fixed with respect to the stars, located above (north of) the Earth, looking down on it and observing these motions.   *  First we notice that, looking down on the Earth's north pole, it is rotating counterclockwise. Such a rotation is essentially a definition of a "north pole".   *  The side of the Earth facing the Sun is in daylight, and the side away from the Sun is at night. Twelve noon would be halfway through the daylight portion, and twelve midnight would be on the opposite side of the Earth, halfway through the night portion.   *  The Sun sets around 6 P.M. as we are carried into the dark side, and rises around 6 A.M. as we are carried back into daylight.   *  Since the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west, these directions must be defined in terms of the rotation: east is in the direction of rotation and west is opposite to that direction, no matter where we stand on the surface of the Earth.   *  Continuing further "north", we are able to see the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The Earth's orbit is very nearly circular, and it defines a plane in space called the plane of the ecliptic. As the Earth moves around the orbit, we say that the Earth revolves around the Sun (to distinguish this motion from rotation). The Earth's revolution is in the same counterclockwise direction as its rotation.   *  Because of the revolution of the Earth, stars shift their position relative to the Sun. For example, in the picture at the right (representing the passage of about two months' time), a star which was overhead at midnight (i.e. directly opposite the Sun) is now overhead at a different time.Question: about what time is it in the second position? As a result of the Earth's revolution, from day to day a particular star will transit (or rise, or set) at earlier and earlier times. This is the same 4 min/day differentiating the sidereal day from the synodic day.3.2 The Tilt of the Earth's Axis(Discovering the Universe, 5th ed., 1-6) *  Moving from directly above the Earth's orbit down outside one edge of the orbit, we can get a perspective view. We then observe that, with respect to the perpendicular to the ecliptic plane (which points to orbital north), the Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of 23.5 :Equivalently, we can say that the Earth's equator is at an angle of 23.5  to the ecliptic plane.The tilt angle is fixed, so the Earth's axis maintains the same orientation with respect to the stars as the Earth revolves around the Sun.   *  When the Earth's north pole is tilted directly towards the Sun, the latter is highest in the sky (in the northern hemisphere), which is what we called the summer solstice. Here in Atlanta, the Sun is 33.4  - 23.5  = 10.2  away from the zenith at the summer solstice.   *  When the north pole is tilted directly away from the Sun, the latter is lowest in the sky (in the northern hemisphere), which is the winter solstice. Here in Atlanta, the Sun is 33.4  + 23.5  = 57.2  away from the zenith at the winter solstice.   *  As before, the intermediate positions are the vernal and autumnal equinoxes. Here in Atlanta, the Sun is 33.7  away from the zenith at the equinoxes.   *  Note that (in the northern hemisphere) daytime (the light part of the circle the person is standing on) is longest at the summer solstice, and it is shortest at the winter solstice.Question: what effect will this have on daily temperature? Daytime and nighttime have roughly equal length at the equinoxes, hence the name, which means "equal night". 3.3 Precession(Discovering the Universe, 5th ed., *1-7) *  The Earth is not a perfect sphere; instead, it is slightly oblate, i.e. it bulges in the middle along the equator. This bulge is due to its rotation and the fact that it is not completely rigid. As a result, the equatorial diameter is 43 Km greater than the polar diameter, a difference of 0.34%.   *  Because the force of gravity weakens with distance, the Sun and Moon have non-uniform gravitational forces on the Earth, pulling harder on the near side of the bulge than on the far side. This differential gravitational force is called a tidal force. Basically, the Sun and Moon try to "straighten" the rotation axis to bring it in line with the orbital axis.   *  However, instead of straightening, the Earth's rotation axis precesses, i.e. it exhibits a slow, conical motion around the orbital axis. Precession is the same effect you see with a top. As long as it is spinning, the top does not fall over, and likewise the Earth's axis won't straighten.   *  The Earth's precession is a very small effect; it takes 26,000 years for the axis to make one full circle! Currently the Earth's axis points within a degree of the star Polaris, and it will slowly get closer until around the year 2100, when it reaches a minimum separation of 27 minutes of arc. Almost 5000 years ago the Earth's axis pointed towards the star Thuban in the constellation of Draco, and this star was used by the ancient Egyptians as their pole star. In 6,000 years the Earth's axis will point towards the star Alderamin in Cepheus, and in 12,000 years it will be near Vega in Lyra.The Earth's precession can be easily observed by standing at the Earth's north pole, where the north celestial pole is at the zenith, and watching how that point changes over time (note the year in the lower-left corner):   *  The circle traced out by the north celestial pole can also be observed on the celestial sphere. Two different positions, now and 13,000 years in the future, are noted in the picture at the right.   *  As the precession of the axis occurs, the orientation of the celestial equator will also change, since it is necessarily perpendicular to the axis.   *  However, the ecliptic is fixed on the sphere. As a result, the intersections between the celestial equator and the ecliptic, the equinoxes, move along the ecliptic 50 arc sec (3.3 sec R.A.) per year. The vernal equinox moves in the direction shown. Currently, the vernal equinox is in Pisces; 2000 years ago it was in Aries; in another 1000 years, it will move into Aquarius.   *  This movement of the celestial equator relative to the ecliptic is called precession of the equinoxes. Obviously, this effect is so slow that it is only observable over many years. Precession was discovered by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who had access to several centuries of Greek and Babylonian records. 3.4 The Calendar(Discovering the Universe, 5th ed., *1-5) *  The sidereal year is defined to be the time for the Sun to return to the same position against the stars. The sidereal year is equal to 365.25 d + 9 min 10s.   *  The tropical year is the time for the Sun to return to the same position relative to the Earth's axis, e.g. summer solstice to summer solstice.Because of precession, the tropical year is 20 min 14 s shorter than the sidereal year, equal to 365.25 d - 11 min 14 s.   *  Neither of these is an integer number of days. The early Roman calendar (~300 B.C.) had 365 days per year, so it was short by roughly one day every four years. As a result, the date of the equinoxes and solstices moved forward on the calendar.   *  In the original Roman calendar the vernal equinox was on March 24. By 45 B.C. it had moved into late May, so the first Roman Emperor Julius Caesar subtracted 63 days from the calendar to bring the equinoxes back to their traditional dates (more than two months were therefore "redone").   *  To keep the equinoxes fixed, Caesar decreed that every four years an extra leap day would be added to the calendar, at the end of the year (February). A year with a leap day added is called a leap year, and this calendar is known as the Julian Calendar.   *  Then, the calendar was too long by 11 min 14 s /year. Even this small amount can build up with time, and the vernal equinox began to move backward on the calendar, about 1 day every 128 years.   *  By 325 A.D. the vernal equinox had moved three days to its current location on March 21. At this time the Roman Emperor Constantine I convened the Council of Nicaea, to establish dates for the Christian holidays. Easter, in particular, was based on the date of the vernal equinox.   *  The vernal equinox continued to move backward on the calendar. By 1582 the vernal equinox had moved another ten days. On the advice of astronomers, Pope Gregory established a new calendar system which accounted for the extra 11 min 14 s. In the Julian calendar, century years had always been leap years; in the new calendar, that would no longer be true, except in years divisible by 400:   *  This arrangement is known as the Gregorian Calendar. Since there is still not a perfect match with the tropical year, even further corrections will eventually be necessary.   *  Gregory also added ten days to the calendar to bring the vernal equinox back in alignment with the dates established by the Council of Nicaea. Ten days were therefore "lost" when October 5, 1582 was decreed to be October 15, 1582. Now the vernal equinox always occurs on or near March 21.   *  Despite its scientific merit, the Gregorian Calendar was widely distrusted in northern Europe, which had only recently broken away from the Catholic church in the Reformation, and in the Eastern Orthodox countries of eastern Europe. So, it wasn't until 1752 that the Gregorian Calendar was finally adopted by England and its colonies. Most eastern European countries didn't adopt the Gregorian Calendar until the early 20th century!</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.uen.org/Lessonplan/preview.cgi?LPid=2416 (sort of)<TEXT>What causes the Earth to be at a different angle from the sun at different times of the year? The tilt of the Earth's axis is what makes this difference. The angle of the Earth's axis from the plane of its orbit is about 66.5  above the plane, which is 23.5  from being perpendicular to the plane of the Earth's orbit (90  - 66.5  = 23.5  ). The seasons are caused because the Earth is not perpendicular (90  angle) to the Earth's orbit around the sun.  Though the orbit of the Earth, from this diagram, looks very elliptical, this is due to the nature of the angle of view portrayed. The Earth's orbit is nearly circular. For instance, look at a paper plate from above. It looks like a circle. Hold the paper plate horizontal to the ground and slightly below eye level. From this view, the paper plate looks like a severe ellipse--as seen in this diagram. This difference is a source of many misconceptions. The sun moves across the sky always staying above the same latitude on a given day. In summary, the reason for the seasons is the angle at which the sun's rays strike the earth, caused the by the tilt of the Earth on its axis. The tilt of the Earth also causes the change in the number of daylight hours experienced throughout the year.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/6h.html<TEXT>Earth Rotation and RevolutionThe term Earth rotation refers to the spinning of the Earth on its axis. One rotation takes exactly twenty-four hours and is called a mean solar day. If you could look down at the Earth's North Pole from space you would notice that the direction of rotation is counterclockwise. The opposite is true if you viewed the Earth from the South Pole.The orbit of the Earth around the sun is called Earth revolution. This celestial motion takes 365 1/4 days to complete one cycle. Further, the Earth's orbit around the sun is not circular, but elliptical (see Figure 6h-1). An elliptical orbit causes the Earth's distance from the sun to vary annually. However, this phenomenon does not cause the seasons! This annual variation in the distance from the sun does influence the amount of solar radiation intercepted by the Earth by approximately 6 %. On January 3rd, perihelion, the Earth is closest to the sun (147.5 million kilometers). The Earth is farthest from the sun on July 4th, or aphelion. The average distance of the Earth from the sun over a one year period is 150 million kilometers.Figure 6h-1: Position of the equinoxes, solstices, aphelion, and perihelion on the Earth's orbit.Tilt of the Earth's AxisThe Earth's axis is not perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, but inclined at a fixed angle of 23.5 . Moreover, the northern end of the Earth's axis always points to the same place in space (North Star). The following link shows an animation of the Earth revolving around the sun: Earth Revolution Animation - Figure 6h-5. In this animation the Earth's axis is colored red. Note that the angle of the Earth's axis in relation to the plane of the ecliptic remains unchanged. However, the relative position of the Earth's axis to the sun does change during this cycle (Figure 6h-2). This circumstance is responsible for the annual changes in the height of the sun above the horizon. It also causes the seasons, by controlling the intensity and duration of sunlight received by locations on the Earth.On June 21 or 22, the summer solstice, the Earth is positioned in its orbit so that the North Pole is leaning 23.5  toward the sun (Figures 6h-2, 6h-3 and see animation - Figure 6h-6). During the summer solstice, all locations North of the equator have day lengths greater than twelve hours, while all locations South of the equator have day lengths less than twelve hours (see Table 6h-2). On December 21 or 22, the winter solstice, the Earth is positioned so that the South Pole is leaning 23.5  toward the sun (Figures 6h-2, 6h-3 and see animation - Figure 6h-7). During the winter solstice, all locations North of the equator have day lengths less than twelve hours, while all locations South of the equator have day lengths greater than twelve hours (see Table 6h-2).Figure 6h-2: Annual change in the position of the Earth in its revolution around the sun. In this graphic, we are viewing the Earth from a position in space that is above the North Pole (yellow dot) at the summer solstice, the winter solstice, and the two equinoxes. Note how the position of the North Pole on the Earth's surface does not change. However, its position relative to the sun does change and this shift is responsible for the seasons. The red circle on each of the Earths represents the Arctic Circle (66.5  N). During the summer solstice, the area above the Arctic Circle is experiencing 24 hours of daylight because the North Pole is tilted 23.5  toward the sun. The Arctic Circle experiences 24 hours of night when the North Pole is tilted 23.5  away from the sun in the winter solstice. During the two equinoxes, the circle of illumination cuts through the polar axis and all locations on the Earth experience 12 hours of day and night.Figure 6h-3: During the summer solstice the Earth's North Pole is tilted 23.5  towards the sun relative to the circle of illumination. This phenomenon keeps all places above a latitude of 66.5  N in 24 hours of sunlight, while locations below a latitude of 66.5  S are in darkness. The North Pole is tilted 23.5  away from the sun relative to the circle of illumination during the winter solstice. On this date, all places above a latitude of 66.5  N are now in darkness, while locations below a latitude of 66.5  S receive 24 hours of daylight.On September 22 or 23, the autumnal equinox, neither pole is tilted toward the sun (Figures 6h-2, 6h-4 and see animation - Figure 6h-8). March 20 or 21 marks the arrival of the spring or vernal equinox when once again the poles are not tilted toward the sun. Day lengths on both of these days, regardless of latitude, are exactly 12 hours.Figure 6h-4: During the equinoxes, the axis of the Earth is not tilted toward or away from the sun and the circle of illumination cuts through the poles. This situation does not suggest that the 23.5  tilt of the Earth no longer exists. The vantage point of this graphic shows that the Earth's axis is inclined 23.5  toward the viewer for both dates (see Figure 6h-2). The red circles shown in the graphic are the Arctic Circle. Axis Tilt and Solar Altitude The annual change in the relative position of the Earth's axis in relationship to the sun causes the height of the sun (solar altitude) to vary in our skies. The total variation in maximum solar altitude for any location on the Earth over a one year period is 47  (2 x 23.5 = 47). For example, at 50  North maximum solar altitude varies from 63.5  on the summer solstice to 16.5  on the winter solstice (Figure 6h-9). Maximum solar height at the equator goes from 66.5  above the northern end of the horizon during the summer solstice, to directly overhead on the fall equinox, and then down to 66.5  above the southern end of the horizon during the summer solstice (Figure 6h-10).Figure 6h-9: Variations in solar altitude at solar noon for 50  North during the summer solstice, equinox, and winter solstice. Figure 6h-10: Variations in solar altitude at solar noon for the equator during the summer solstice, equinox, and winter solstice. The location on the Earth where the sun is directly overhead at solar noon is known as the subsolar point. The subsolar point occurs on the equator during the equinoxes (Figure 6h-11). During the summer solstice, the subsolar point moves to the Tropic of Cancer because at this time the North Pole is tilted 23.5  toward the sun. The subsolar point is located at the Tropic of Capricorn on the winter solstice. On this date, the South Pole is now tilted toward the sun (Figures 6h-2 and 6h-3). Figure 6h-11: Relationship of maximum sun height to latitude for the equinox (left) and summer solstice (right). The red values on the right of the globes are maximum solar altitudes at solar noon. Black numbers on the left indicate the location of the Equator, Tropic of Cancer (23.5  N), Tropic of Capricorn (23.5  S), Arctic Circle (66.5  N), and the Antarctic Circle (66.5  S). The location of the North and South Poles are also identified. During the equinox, the equator is the location on the Earth with a sun angle of 90  for solar noon. Note how maximum sun height declines with latitude as you move away from the Equator. For each degree of latitude traveled maximum sun height decreases by the same amount. At equinox, you can also calculate the noon angle by subtracting the location's latitude from 90. During the summer solstice, the sun is now directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer. All locations above this location have maximum sun heights that are 23.5  higher from the equinox situation. Places above the Arctic Circle are in 24 hours of daylight. Below the Tropic of Cancer the noon angle of the sun drops one degree in height for each degree of latitude traveled. At the Antarctic Circle, maximum sun height becomes 0  and locations south of this point on the Earth are in 24 hours of darkness. The following table describes the changes in solar altitude at solar noon for the two solstices and equinoxes. All measurements are in degrees (horizon has 180 degrees from True North to True South) and are measured from either True North or True South (whatever is closer). Table 6h-1: Maximum sun altitudes for selected latitudes during the two solstices and equinoxes.The following links show graphical illustrations of the annual movements of the sun in our skies for selected latitudes. In these illustrations, solar angles are measured from both True North and True South for solar noon. Finally, the altitude of the sun at solar noon can also be calculated with the following simple equation:Altitude A = 90 - Latitude L +/- Declination DIn this equation, L is the latitude of the location in degrees and D is the declination. The equation is simplified to A = 90 - L if sun angle determinations are being made for either equinox date. If the sun angle determination is for a solstice date, declination (D) is added to latitude (L) if the location is experiencing summer (northern latitudes = summer solstice; southern latitudes = winter solstice) and subtracted from latitude (L) if the location is experiencing winter (northern latitudes = winter solstice; southern latitudes = summer solstice). All answers from this equation are given relative to True North for southern latitudes and True South for northern latitudes. For our purposes only the declinations of the two solstices and two equinoxes are important. These values are: Summer Solstice D=23.5, Winter Solstice D=23.5, Autumnal Equinox D=0, and Vernal Equinox D=0. When using the above equation in tropical latitudes, sun altitude values greater than 90  may occur for some calculations. When this occurs, the noonday sun is actually behind you when looking towards the equator. Under these circumstances, sun altitude should be recalculated as follows:Altitude A = 90 - (originally calculated Altitude A - 90) </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.msnucleus.org/membership/html/k-6/uc/earth/6/uce6_2a.html <TEXT>The seasons are caused by the positioning of the Earth with respect to the Sun as it revolves around the Sun, and by the tilt of its axis. This will cause different seasonal climates throughout the Earth. For example, during June 21, it will be the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, but in the southern hemisphere it will be the winter solstice.The varying distance of the Earth from the Sun is not an important factor in seasonal changes as much as is the intensity of solar energy that strikes the earth's surface. The intensity depends mostly on the angle at which it strikes the Earth's surface. The steeper the angle, the more it is concentrated. Solar energy is concentrated most on the Northern Hemisphere during its summer season when the north axis is titled toward the Sun. More hours of daylight also occur at this time (hence, summers are warmer than winter). Simultaneously, the Southern Hemisphere is experiencing winter. Six months later, when the Earth is on the opposite side of its orbit, the north end of the axis is tilted away from the Sun and it has its winter. Fall and spring occur in between these two extremes when the axis is tilted neither toward or away from the Sun.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.crh.noaa.gov/fsd/astro/season.php<TEXT>The seasons have nothing to do with how far the Earth is from the Sun.  If this were the case, it would be hotter in the northern hemisphere during January as opposed to July.  Instead, the seasons are caused by the Earth being tilted on its axis by an average of 23.5 degrees (Earth's tilt on its axis actually varies from near 22 degrees to 24.5 degrees).  Here's how it works:The Earth has an elliptical orbit around our Sun.  This being said, the Earth is at its closest point distance wise to the Sun in January (called the Perihelion) and the furthest in July (the Aphelion).  But this distance change is not great enough to cause any substantial difference in our climate.  This is why the Earth's 23.5 degree tilt is all important in changing our seasons.  Near June 21st, the summer solstice, the Earth is tilted such that the Sun is positioned directly over the Tropic of Cancer at 23.5 degrees north latitude.  This situates the northern hemisphere in a more direct path of the Sun's energy.  What this means is less sunlight gets scattered before reaching the ground because it has less distance to travel through the atmosphere.  In addition, the high sun angle produces long days.  The opposite is true in the southern hemisphere, where the low sun angle produces short days.  Furthermore, a large amount of the Sun's energy is scattered before reaching the ground because the energy has to travel through more of the atmosphere.  Therefore near June 21st, the southern hemisphere is having its winter solstice because it "leans" away from the Sun.Advancing 90 days, the Earth is at the autumnal equinox on or about September 21st.  As the Earth revolves around the Sun, it gets positioned such that the Sun is directly over the equator.   Basically, the Sun's energy is in balance between the northern and southern hemispheres.  The same holds true on the spring equinox near March 21st, as the Sun is once again directly over the equator. Lastly, on the winter solstice near December 21st, the Sun is positioned directly over the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5 degrees south latitude.  The southern hemisphere is therefore receiving the direct sunlight, with little scattering of the sun's rays and a high sun angle producing long days.  The northern hemisphere is tipped away from the Sun, producing short days and a low sun angle.What kind of effect does the earth's tilt and subsequent seasons have on our length of daylight (defined as sunrise to sunset). Over the equator, the answer is not much.  If you live on or very close to the equator, your daylight would be basically within a few minutes of 12 hours the year around.  Using the northern hemisphere as a reference, the daylight would lengthen/shorten during the summer/winter moving northward from the equator.  The daylight difference is subtle in the tropics, but becomes extremely large in the northern latitudes.  Where we live in the mid latitudes, daylight ranges from about 15 hours around the summer solstice to near nine hours close to the winter solstice.   Moving to the arctic circle at 66.5 degrees north latitude, the Sun never sets from early June to early July.  But around the winter solstice, the daylight only lasts slightly more than two hours.  There becomes a profound difference in the length of daylight heading north of the arctic circle.  Barrow, Alaska at slightly more than 71 degrees north latitude, lies just less than 300 nautical miles north of the arctic circle.  Barrow sees two months of total darkness, as the Sun never rises for about a month on each side of the winter solstice.  On the other hand, Barrow also has total light from mid May to early August.  And what about the north pole, or 90 degrees north latitude?  The Sun rises in the early evening near the spring equinox and never sets again until just after the autumnal equinox, or six months of light.  Conversely, after the Sun sets in the mid morning just after the autumnal equinox, it will not be seen again until the following spring equinox, equating to six months of darkness.  </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://ethomas.web.wesleyan.edu/ees123/milank.htm<TEXT>The Pacemaker of the Ice Ages: Milankovitch Cycles in ClimateDuring the last few millions of years there were many alternations of glacial and interglacial times, times of expansion and contraction of the polar ice caps. During this lecture we will not discuss how we measure past ice volume: we will get to that in the upcoming weeks. This week we will look at the pattern of fluctuations in ice volume. The changes in ice volume were cyclical, with a rather complex periodicity. Such a periodicity can be produced by adding up three wave functions, which a wavelength of about 100,000, 41,000 and 23,000-19,000 years (as in adding up the wave functions in biorhythm analysis). These waves represent increases and decreases in solar energy as seen at a specific location on Earth. The three periodicities are well-known to astronomers, because they describe irregularities in the pattern of the Earth's motion around the Sun (and are therefore called orbital parameters). These irregularities are caused by the gravitational effects of the other planets circling the Sun.Such irregularities cause fluctuations not in how much solar energy is received by the whole Earth, but in how much solar energy is received at a specific latitude on Earth, or in the distribution of solar energy by latitude and by season. The three periodicities are commonly called Milankovitch periodicities, after the Serbian mathematician who calculated them in the 1930s, and thought they might have caused ice ages, by causing small differences in the amount of solar energy (insolation) that reaches the Earth at the high latitudes where the ice sheets form. The idea behind this theory is that in order to form a large ice sheet much snow must accumulate in the winter, which cannot melt in the summer. If we thus have a fairly cool summer, but not too cold a winter, ice sheets can be expected to grow. Winter should not be too cold, because at very low temperatures the atmosphere can not contain much water vapor, so that no snow can fall.First, we have to know how the Earth moves around the Sun, in its elliptical orbit. The earth's axis is inclined and not at right angles with the plane through the orbit. This inclination (about 23.5) results in the seasons: the southern hemisphere is tiled towards the Sun during its summer which occurs during northern hemisphere winter, and the reverse. Days are longer, nights shorter on the hemisphere that is turned towards the Sun. Twice a year, in the equinoxes, day and night have the same length. During the northern hemisphere winter solstice, the shortest day occurs on the northern hemisphere and the longest day on the southern hemisphere; during the northern hemisphere summer solstice the day is longest on the northern hemisphere, shortest on the southern hemisphere. This regular patterns of motion, however, is changed because of the disturbance of gravity of the Earth by the presence of the other planets.  The three orbital parameters are: *  Variation in eccentricity,  or  ellipticity  of the Earth's orbit; periodicity about 100,000 years. The shape  of the Earth's orbit around the Sun varies, from an almost exact  circle (ellipticity 0) to a slightly elongated shape (eccentricity  0.06). The eccentricity influences seasonal differences: when the  earth is closest to the Sun, it gets more solar radiation. If that  occurs during the winter, the winter is less severe. If a  hemisphere has its summer while closest to the Sun, summers are  relatively warm. Nowadays, the Earth is closest to the Sun in the  northern hemisphere winter (causing relatively warm winters),  furthest from the Sun in northern hemisphere summer (causing  relatively cool summers). Note below that eccentricity and  precession both influence the character of the seasons. *   Variation in  obliquity,  i.e., the  tilt  of the Earth's axis away from the orbital plane. Periodicity  41,000 years. The tilt varies between 22 and 25, and  is on average about 23.5. Note that obliquity  describes the tilt of the Earth's axis, but not its direction of  tilt. At higher tilts, the seasonality at high latitudes becomes  more extreme; changes in tilt have little effect in the tropics,  maximum effect at the poles. *   Precession  of the equinoxes, periodicities of about 23,000 and 19,000 years.  Precession is a rather complex phenomenon, which is caused by two  factors: a wobble of the Earth's axis, and a turning-around of the  elliptical orbit of the Earth itself. Note that the precession  affects the direction of the earth's axis, not its tilt. The combined and complex wobbly motion of the Earth has the following  result: the equinoxes (days of equal length of night and day) do  not keep occurring during the same day of the calendar, but slowly  shift. Presently, the Earth is closest to the Sun in the northern  hemisphere winter, which makes the winter there less severe. In about 11,000 years in the future the Earth will be closest to the  Sun in the northern hemisphere summer, making northern hemisphere  summers warmer, winters colder. The precession effect thus causes  warm winters and cool summers in one hemisphere, while doing the  opposite across the equator.  The Milankovitch theory states that ice caps at the poles increased and decreased in size as a reflection of the solar energy received at fairly high latitudes; the insolation at 65oN is commonly used to look at the waxing and waning of ice sheets. For a nice computer visualization of how insolation changed over the northern hemispheric polar region, click here.We have now observed in very many different records that ice volume over the last few millions years indeed waxes and wanes on the time scales of irregularities in the Earth's orbit, and that the northern hemispheric insolation, not the insolation of the southern hemisphere, appears to drive the process. For instance, we now have relatively warm winters on the northern hemisphere (because these winters occur when the earth is close to the Sun), and our winters are colder because we are far away from the sun when our side of the planet is tilted away from the Sun.The fact that the history of ice volume occurred at these orbital frequencies implicates the differences in insolation in triggering ice ages, but very many questions remain. *  The orbital fluctuations can not be the whole  story: over large parts of Earth's history there were no ice  sheets, and the orbital character of the Earth fluctuated in the same way. We have indeed ample evidence of climate fluctuations on  Earth at times that the ice sheets were much smaller than today's  ice sheets, or even absent, at Milankovitch periodicities. Then why  did these fluctuations not cause ice ages during these earlier  periods of Earth history? *   There have been changes over time in which one  of the three orbital fluctuations had the dominant effect. For the  last 900 to 1200 thousand years the eccentricity has been  dominant, before that the 40 thousand year obliquity was dominant.  Why did this dominance change? *   From the climate theoretical point of view,  the differences in solar heat received are very small, much too  small to explain the large differences in climate. These differences largely relate to the distribution of energy over the  Earth, but we have evidence that global temperatures  changed during the ice ages. We therefore think that one or more  positive feedback mechanisms must have enhanced the Milankovitch  differences in temperature. *   One possible enhancer is the amount of  CO2 in the atmosphere, which fluctuated at the same  periodicity as the ice volume, and was less by about 90 ppm (parts per million) during glacial periods, as we will discuss next week.  But which was cause, which was effect? *  Other possibilities include the position of  the continents: since the last few million years the northern  hemispheric ice sheets grew and became smaller, and they had large  continents where they could spread out. But the Antarctic ice  sheet has covered the Antarctic continent and shallow seas, and  can not easily grow by much.  We are therefore not sure of the exact causes of the ice ages. Milankovitch differences in insolation were the trigger, but many other feedback mechanisms probably operated. Some simple ones are: 1.   positive feedback. When ice caps are  larger, a larger surface area of the earth is white, and reflect  back much heat from the sun into space, cooling down earth further, leading to enlarge ice caps, etc. 2.    positive feedback. When ocean water  cools, it can dissolved more CO2 (a gas), and thus  takes up more CO2, leading to more cooling,  etc. 3.   negative feedback. When sea level  drops, we get more land, less ocean surface. Vegetated land  reflects less solar heat into space than ocean, so lower sea  levels may lead to warming. When ice caps grow, sea level drops. 4.    negative feedback. When ocean waters  cool, less water evaporates; that means less precipitation world  wide, which means lesser ice caps (made up of snow), see further  point 1.The complexity of perceived climate change in glacial-interglacial times is increasing rapidly with more and more knowledge. A more detailed knowledge of the way in which the ocean-atmosphere system works, and of the role of the biosphere in shaping climate (by its effects on the carbon cycle) is needed before we can begin to understand even this latest, best-known part of Earth history.Measure of ice volume on Earth.

What would Charon look like from Pluto, or Pluto from Charon? Charon is about half of Pluto's size and located about 17 "Pluto radii" away. This means that the disk of Charon is about 3.5 degrees across when seen from Pluto, and Pluto is twice that size (7 degrees) when seen from Charon. This diagram shows one way to measure angles with your fingers. If you hold your arm out toward the sky, the width of a finger is about 1 degree. This means that from Pluto the disk of Charon is about 3 or 4 fingers across. Our Moon (and Sun, coincidentally) is about one-half of a degree across - the width of a skinny pinky finger. From Charon, the disk of Pluto is wider than an outstretched fist. Wouldn't that be an amazing sight in the sky!Cycle of PhasesWe are used to the Moon rising and setting every day, mainly due to Earth's daily spin. We also know how the Moon's appearance changes over a month. The 29 1/2-day lunar cycle of phases stems from the changing illumination by the Sun as the Moon orbits Earth. Because the Moon's spin period is the same as its orbital period around Earth, the same face of the Moon always faces the Earth. We never get to see the "backside" of the Moon from our planet. Now try to think about what Charon would look like from Pluto - and Pluto from Charon. Just like our Moon, Charon's spin period is the same as its orbital period - 6.4 Earth days in Charon's case - and from Pluto you only see the one side of the moon. But Pluto also spins at the same 6.4-day rate, meaning that from Charon a person would only see one side of Pluto. This leads to an interesting situation - illustrated below and animated here - where a (red) person on the "backside" of Pluto never sees Charon and a (red) person on the "backside" of Charon never sees Pluto.Moreover, from any particular location on Pluto Charon appears to stay in the same place in the night sky for the whole 6.4 days - and Pluto appears fixed in the sky when viewed from Charon.While Pluto/Charon does not appear to move when viewed from Charon/Pluto, the illumination by the Sun does change. So, both Pluto and Charon go through a 6.4-day cycle of phases. In this diagram the top panel shows the cycle of phases seen by the (blue) person on Pluto looking up at Charon at times 1-8 over the 6.4-day cycle.In this diagram the top panel shows the cycle of phases seen by the (blue) person on Charon looking up at Pluto at times 1-8 over the 6.4-day cycle. The tilt of Pluto's spin (and Charon's orbit) leads to more subtle changes in the phases over Pluto's full year. New Horizons science team member Marc Buie of Lowell Observatory shows more of these effects on phases of Charon on his Web site. Because objects in the outer solar system never come between Earth and the Sun, we never see their "backsides" and so we'd never see a new or crescent Pluto from Earth. Wherever we are in our orbit around the Sun we'd see the sunlit side of a Pluto and it always looks nearly full. What a shame!We can detect if Pluto's surface is smooth or rough by looking at it during different phases, just as you can tell the difference between a ball bearing and a cotton ball by how they reflect light at different angles. By flying behind Pluto - as scientists plan - the New Horizons spacecraft will take pictures of Pluto in phases we could never see from Earth.'Tis the SeasonsSeasons on Earth are mainly caused by the 23-degree tilt of its spin axis. This axis points in a fixed direction toward Polaris (also known as the North Star or Pole Star). The diagram shows an oblique view of Earth's roughly circular orbit. Because Earth's axis tilts with respect to its orbital plane, the angle of the sunlight we receive in different places over the globe changes during the year. From March until September, when the North Pole points toward the Sun, the days are longer, the Sun is higher in the Northern Hemisphere, and we have northern summer and southern winter. Because Earth's orbit is very close to circular, the slight change in distance between the Earth and the Sun does not cause any appreciable change in sunlight. In fact, we are slightly closer to the Sun in December than we are in July. This diagram refers to seasons experienced in the Northern Hemisphere. The Southern Hemisphere has equinox (equal night and day) at the same time, but experiences winter while it's summer in the north and vice versa.Seasons on PlutoBoth tilt and distance affect seasons on Pluto. The planet's spin axis is nearly "sideways," tilted over 120 degrees, so the tilt alone leads to extreme seasons on Pluto. And because Pluto's eccentric orbit swings it between 29.7 and 49.3 AU from the Sun, the amount of sunlight varies by a factor of 280% over a Pluto year (rather than just a 5% variation on Earth). Since planets move faster when closer to the Sun, Pluto's northern spring lasts much longer than the quickly passing northern fall.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/Season.html <TEXT>One of the four periods into which the year is divided based upon the position of the Sun in the sky. The four seasons are spring, summer, autumn (also called fall), and winter. Some elementary textbooks claim that seasons are caused by the Earth getting slightly closer to the Sun at perihelion, resulting in higher temperatures.  THIS IS COMPLETELY WRONG. First of all, seasons are shifted by a half year in the northern and southern hemispheres (so that it is summer in the southern hemisphere when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, etc.), which contradicts the perihelion explanation. Second of all, the Earth turns out to be closest to the Sun in January (January 4 at 21:00 UT in 1998), which is winter in the northern hemisphere. The real cause of seasons is the 23.5  obliquity  of the Earth's rotational axis to its orbital plane. The hemisphere of the Earth which is tilted toward the Sun receives a greater flux of solar energy ("flux" is just a fancy word for energy per unit area per unit time) than the hemisphere tilted away, resulting in higher temperatures. The effect of incidence angle on solar flux is well-known to everyone, since the day is warmest when the Sun is overhead (at which point the Earth's surface is nearly perpendicular to it) and then cools as the Sun nears the horizon (at which point the sunlight grazes the ground at an angle, resulting in a smaller amount of heating per unit area of the ground). Here is a QuickTime movie illustrating the tilt of the Earth's equatorial plane relative to the Sun which is responsible for the seasons. The dates of maximum tilt of the Earth's equator correspond to the summer solstice and winter solstice, and the dates of zero tilt to the vernal equinox and autumnal equinox.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>?? Can't source<TEXT>Springtime. The word evokes smiles and happy memories of outside play. The days are longer and warmer. At the north and south poles of Earth, spring brings dramatic changes. Seasons at the poles are different and extreme. At the north pole, March 20 is the first day in six months that the sun rises. Polar bears will be stretching and rolling in the welcome sun that they have been missing. At the south pole, where the seasons are opposite, the sun will set for six months of darkness. Penguins will huddle up as the sun slips below the horizon, ready for six months of cold and dark.Do other planets have seasons? Yes, almost every planet in our solar system has four seasons. What are seasons like on other planets? Some are extreme with big changes in the weather, like seasons at the north and south poles of Earth. Seasons on all planets are opposite in the northern and in the southern hemispheres. When it is spring in the northern hemisphere, it is fall in the southern part of the world. That's because when the north pole is pointed toward the Sun, the south pole is pointed away. Summer on one end of the Earth means winter on the other!No matter what world you're on, seasons are caused by the tilt of the planet's axis and its distance from the Sun. Some people think that the Earth is closer to the Sun in summer and farther away during winter. Wrong! Earth goes around the sun in a nearly perfect circle. It is always about the same distance from our star. Here on Earth, the tilt is most important. Our planet is tilted by 23 degrees. Because of this, the north half of the Earth faces the sun between March and September. The south half faces the Sun during the other six months of the year. The increase in direct sunlight makes those areas of our planet warmer, snow melts, and green plants push their way up out of the dirt. On March 20, when northern spring arrives on Earth, it will also be spring on two other planets in our solar system, Jupiter and Venus. Unlike Earth, the planets Jupiter and Venus are not tilted very much, only 3 degrees. Since the tilt is so slight, seasonal changes on Jupiter and Venus are small. On Venus, spring is not much different from fall. The planet's dense atmosphere keeps the surface at 750 degrees Kelvin (about 900 deg F, hot enough to melt lead) throughout the year.Mars also has four seasons. If you were to plan a vacation to Mars, you would want to carefully consult with an astronomer before you packed your suitcase. The first detail that you would notice is that a year on Mars is almost twice as long as a year on Earth. That means that the seasons are longer, too. On Earth, summer is about 93 days long and temperatures get quite toasty; when the afternoon sunlight warms the air to above 80 degrees many people go swimming and play baseball. On Mars, northern summer is about 178 days long, but the temperatures are not as friendly. A warm summer day on Mars might warm up to zero degrees Celsius (freezing). Even if you found some water on Mars, you could not swim in it. Ice skates and a warm jacket would be a better choice than shorts and sandals. At night during the summer it's 70 degrees below zero! You do not want to plan on camping.  Winter on Mars is too cold for most of our winter sports. On a typical winter day, the temperature might get up to 60 degrees below zero (Celsius). The winter nights are even colder, an incredibly frigid 100 degrees below zero (Celsius). Your hot cocoa would freeze before you took the first sip.Spring on Mars does not bring showers or flowers. After 154 days of winter, spring does bring warmer temperatures. It also brings a thicker atmosphere with more carbon dioxide from the melting polar cap made of dry ice. On Earth, spring is closely associated with a renewal of life, plants blooming, and animals having babies. On Mars, there does not appear to be any life. Although it is possible that microscopic critters could exist, they would be so small that you could not see them without a powerful microscope. They would also have to be tough enough to exist in all the Martian seasons.  One of the differences between seasons on Mars and Earth is what causes them. Seasons on Earth are caused by the tilt of our planet's axis. Seasons on Mars are influenced by the tilt of its axis and by its varying distance from the Sun. While Earth is always about the same distance from the Sun, the orbit of Mars is more elliptical. Mars is closest to the Sun (and moving fastest in its orbit) during southern summer. This makes summer in the south of Mars shorter and hotter than summer in the north.Seasons on Uranus are even stranger than they are on Mars. Although the orbital path that Uranus follows around the sun is almost a circle, the planet has a seriously tilted axis - the angle of tilt is 82 degrees! What does this mean? It means that the seasons are extremely long! It takes Uranus about 84 Earth years to go around the sun. Each season is about 20 years long! Because of the tilt, during the entire 20 year long winter, the whole northern hemisphere is dark and cold. In spring, as the sunlight begins to warm the northern areas, there are gigantic springtime storms with temperatures of 200 degrees below zero (Celsius)! It will be spring in the year 2006 on Uranus, but it does not sound like good baseball weather!</TEXT></DOC><DOC>?? Can't source<TEXT>Seasons affect all of human life. They affect the foods we eat, how we play, and what we wear. Spring is the season for fresh fruit, fishing and gardening, and light jackets. In the northern hemisphere, spring starts on March 20, a day that is called the "vernal equinox." On that day, the sun shines directly over the equator and is moving north. The lengths of the day and night are almost exactly the same. In America, it is time to look for shorts, sandals, and tennis rackets. Spring has arrived!</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-03/whoi-cie032905.php<TEXT>scientists have long debated what causes glacial/interglacial cycles, which have occurred most recently at intervals of about 100,000 years. A new study reported in the March 24 issue of Nature finds that these glacial cycles are paced by variations in the tilt of Earth's axis, and that glaciations end when Earth's tilt is large.  With more than 30 explanations proposed for these glacial cycles, researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) looked at the various possibilities to determine a more precise explanation. Some hypotheses suggested changes in Earth's orbit, others that glacial cycles are caused by random climate variability. The researchers found that the most plausible cause was that variations in the tilt of the Earth's axis control the timing of glaciations, acting as a planetary pacemaker of sorts.  Peter Huybers, a postdoctoral fellow in the WHOI Geology and Geophysics Department, and coauthor Carl Wunsch of MIT developed a simple model to look at the effects of changes in Earth's tilt, which determines climate belts around the planet and the seasons of the year. They also focused on rapid deglaciation events known as terminations, easily identified in climate records by their magnitude and abruptness. They first estimated the timing of glacial cycles using the rate at which sediment accumulates on the ocean floor as an indicator of time. The age estimates were then used to compare the timing of the glacial cycles with the timing of changes in Earth's orbit, known from the laws of motion and observations of the galaxy.  "Many studies have suggested a link between orbital variations and the approximately 100,000-year glacial cycles which occurred during the late Pleistocene, about 1 million to 10,000 years ago, but this is the first rigorous test of whether the glacial cycles are, in fact, paced by orbital variations," Huybers said. "We found that glaciations end near times when the Earth's tilt, or obliquity, is large. This narrows the number of possible explanations for the glacial cycles to those which can account for the tilt pacing of glacial cycles."  Obliquity, the angle between Earth's equatorial and orbital planes or the tilt in Earth's axis, varies between 22.5 and 24 degrees during a cycle of 41,000 years. As the tilt increases, so does the annual average sunlight reaching high latitudes, and these are the conditions under which Huybers and Wunsch find that glaciations end. Earth's tilt is currently 23.5 degrees and decreasing. Without the much more rapid anthropogenic or human influences on climate, Earth would probably be slowly moving toward glaciation.  "While we are confident that Earth's tilt paces the 100,000-year glacial cycles, we were not able to determine whether another orbital effect, the precession of Earth's equinoxes, also contributes to the pacing," Huybers said. Precession measures the slow change in the orientation of Earth's rotation axis, similar to a spinning top, and has been the favorite explanation amongst most scientists for the timing of the glacial cycles.  One major question is how can a 40,000-year tilt cycle produce 100,000-year glacial cycles? Huybers and Wunsch suggest that during the late Pleistocene glaciation did not end every time the tilt was large, but rather that glaciers grew over two (80,000 years) or three (120,000 years) obliquity cycles before ending. The average glacial duration then gives the 100,000-year time scale.  A possible explanation for why deglaciations do not occur every 40,000 years is that ice sheets must become large enough before they are sensitive to changes in Earth's tilt. Huybers and Wunsch developed a simple mathematical model to express this idea of changing sensitivity and showed that it gives the right timing for the glacial cycles.  Obliquity control of the recent glacial cycles provides a fresh view on the dramatic climate swings the Earth has been subjected to over the past one million years. "While the problem is far from solved, we are now one step closer to understanding the origins of the ice ages," Huybers said.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>??? can't source exactly (though I can find pieces) http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=4456&type=6&root=6&parent=6&cat=65, http://www.dreammakershop.com/solstice.html<TEXT>SEASON is one of the four periods of the year. Each season--spring, summer, autumn, and winter--lasts about three months and brings changes in temperature, weather, and the length of daylight.During the spring, the days are warm in middle parts of the Northern Hemisphere, the northern half of the Earth. Summer follows with hot days and warm nights. In autumn, the days become cooler, leading to the cold of winter. The four periods are called climatic seasons when based on these temperature and weather changes.In the Southern Hemisphere, the climatic seasons differ by about six months. This hemisphere has summer when the Northern Hemisphere has winter.The changing seasons are caused by the changing position of the Earth in relation to the sun. Astronomers can tell exactly from the Earth's motion around the sun when one season ends and the next one begins.The dates used for the first day of each season mark the beginning of the astronomical seasons. The beginning and end of the climatic seasons vary from these dates from place to place and from year to year.The temperature and weather do not change instantly in response to the changing position of the Earth in relation to the sun. The warmest and coldest weather generally occurs several weeks after the beginning of the summer and winter astronomical seasons. Heat that has been retained by the oceans plays an important role in producing this delayed response.The seasons keep changing because the tilt of the Earth's axis never changes while the Earth circles the sun. One way to understand this is to picture which way the tilt of the axis causes the North Pole to slant at different times of the year.When the North Pole slants toward the sun, the Northern Hemisphere receives the most sunlight and it is summer there. When the pole slants away from the sun, the Northern Hemisphere receives the least sunlight and it is winter. Spring begins when the pole starts to slant toward the sun, and autumn begins when the pole starts to slant away again. EQUINOX is either of the two days of the year when the sun is directly above Earth's equator. At these times, the days and nights are of nearly equal length everywhere on Earth. The term equinox comes from a Latin word meaning equal night. The equinoxes occur on March 19, 20, or 21 and on September 22 or 23. In the Northern Hemisphere, the March equinox marks the start of spring and is often called the vernal equinox. The position of the vernal equinox is called the first point of Aries. The word vernal means of spring. The September equinox marks the beginning of autumn and is called the autumnal equinox. The seasons are reversed in the Southern Hemisphere. The time interval from the March equinox to the September equinox is longer than that between the September equinox and the next March equinox. This time difference results from Earth's elliptical (oval-shaped) orbit around the sun. Earth moves faster in its orbit when it is closer to the sun. The distance between Earth and the sun is shortest in January. Therefore, Earth completes the semicircle from the September equinox to the March equinox faster than it does the opposite semicircle. Astronomers also use the term equinox for either of two imaginary points where the sun's apparent path among the stars crosses the celestial equator. The celestial equator is an imaginary line through the sky directly over the equator. The positions of the two equinoctial points do not remain the same from year to year. They shift westward extremely slowly-about 1 degree every 70 years. This gradual movement of the points, called the precession of the equinoxes, is caused by a slight change in the direction of Earth's axis of rotation. The change results mainly from the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun on Earth's equatorial bulge. SOLSTICE is one of the two moments each year when the sun is at either its northernmost or southernmost position. The sun appears directly overhead at different latitudes during the year because of the tilt of Earth's axis of rotation. The axis is tilted at an angle of 23 degrees 27 minutes in relation to the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun. One solstice occurs on June 20, 21, or 22, when the sun reaches its most northerly point, directly overhead at the Tropic of Cancer (23 degrees 27 minutes north latitude). At the other solstice, on December 21 or 22, the sun appears at its most southerly position, directly overhead at the Tropic of Capricorn (23 degrees 27 minutes south latitude). In the Northern Hemisphere, the June solstice is known as the summer solstice, and the December solstice is called the winter solstice. The day of the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere is the longest day of the year. This day marks the beginning of summer. Similarly, the winter solstice occurs on the shortest day of the year and marks the beginning of winter. In the Southern Hemisphere, summer and winter are reversed. Some regions do not have all four climatic seasons.In parts of the tropics, for example, temperatures change little. But the amount of rainfall varies greatly, so that these regions have a wet season and a dry season.The polar regions, on the other hand, have a light season and a dark season. In these parts of the world, the sun shines almost all the time in summer and almost never during the winter.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/time/seasons.html<TEXT> The primary cause of the seasons is the 23.5 degree  of the Earth's rotation axis with respect to the plane of the ecliptic, as illustrated in the adjacent image (Source). This means that as the Earth goes around its orbit the Northern hemisphere is at various times oriented more toward and more away from the Sun, and likewise for the Southern hemisphere, as illustrated in the following figure. The Seasons in the Northern Hemisphere  Thus, we experience Summer in the Northern Hemisphere when the Earth is on that part of its orbit where the N. Hemisphere is oriented more toward the Sun and therefore the Sun rises higher in the sky and is above the horizon longer, and the rays of the Sun strike the ground more directly. Likewise, in the N. Hemisphere Winter the hemisphere is oriented away from the Sun, the Sun only rises low in the sky, is above the horizon for a shorter period, and the rays of the Sun strike the ground more obliquely. In fact, as the diagram indicates, the Earth is actually closer to the Sun in the N. Hemisphere Winter than in the Summer (as usual, we greatly exaggerate the eccentricity of the elliptical orbit in this diagram). The Earth is at its closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) on about January 4 of each year, which is the dead of the N. Hemisphere Winter. (The time for perihelion, aphelion, and the solstices for any year 1992-2000 is available in this compilation.) For a more extensive introduction to how variations in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth's surface influence climate, see this discussion of  solar databases for global change models. This conveys the impression that the Earth moves around its orbit and at certain times of the year the rotation axis suddenly tips one way or another and thus we have seasons. As the preceding diagram makes clear, the rotation axis of the Earth remains pointed in the same direction (except for small effects from  precession) as it moves around its orbit. It is the relative location of the Sun with respect to this constant tilt angle that causes the seasons, not some elaborate square dance of the Earth bowing to its partner as it moves around its orbit! Southern Hemisphere Seasons As is clear from the preceding diagram, the seasons in the Southern Hemisphere are determined from the same reasoning, except that they are out of phase with the N. Hemisphere seasons because when the N. Hemisphere is oriented toward the Sun the S. Hemisphere is oriented away, and vice versa: The Seasons in the Southern Hemisphere  The Lag of the Seasons The preceding reasoning for the causes of the seasons is idealized. In reality, we know that the seasons "lag": for example, the hottest temperatures in the Summer usually occur a month or so after the time of  maximum insolation (the time when maximum solar energy is deposited during a day at a point on the surface of the Earth). This is because the Earth and its atmosphere store heat (the oceans are particularly effective heat sinks). Thus, a detailed description of the seasons is quite complicated since it must take into account complex local variations in the storage of solar energy. However, the basic reason for the seasons is simple, as described above. Simulating the Apparent Motion of the Sun One can use the Starry Night program for Windows and the Macintosh to simulate the appearance of the sky at any time, from any chosen vantage point in the Solar System. Thus, by choosing different points on the surface of the Earth at different times of the year, this program can be used to show the motion of the Sun through the sky and illustrate clearly the preceding points about the causes for the seasons. Here is an extreme example: In the N. Hemisphere Summer at latitudes above the Arctic Circle (23.5 degrees away from the N. Pole) the Sun stays above the horizon for the entire day (midnight sun). The adjacent image illustrates the midnight sun. This  GOES-8 weather satellite visible light image is taken from a vantage point high above the western hemisphere, with the North at the top. Even though the local time for the longitude line under the satellite is near midnight, the Northernmost portion of the globe is illuminated by sunlight (the lighted portion actually extends below the arctic circle in this image because of sunlight scattering in the atmosphere). This simulation of the midnight sun was made using the  Starry Night program with a "fisheye lens" perspective to show a wide (180 degree) region of the sky from a vantage point at the North Pole on July 4, 1996. As the movie illustrates, the Sun moves more or less parallel to the horizon and never goes below it during the course of a day at these latitudes at this time of the year. Conversely, in the N. Hemisphere Winter the Sun never comes above the horizon for the entire day at this latitude. This is an extreme example of the difference in insolation in Winter and Summer for the N. Hemisphere that is responsible for the seasons. The exact time of sunrise and sunset (and similar data for moonrise and moonset) may be calculated for any date and 22,000 named cities in the United States, or by specifying the latitude and longitude of any location worldwide, using this program. For locations in the United States, a table of corresponding information for an entire year (past, present, or future) may be calculated using  this program</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.science.edu.sg/ssc/detailed.jsp?artid=4456&type=6&root=6&parent=6&cat=65<TEXT>The changing seasons are caused by the changing position of the Earth in relation to the Sun. The seasons keep changing because the tilt of the Earth's axis never changes while the Earth circles the Sun. The inclination of the Earth's axis of rotation to the orbital plane coupled with the yearly revolution around the Sun produces the changing weather patterns called the seasons. One way to understand this is to picture which way the tilt of the axis causes the North Pole to slant at different times of the year. When the North Pole slants toward the Sun, the Northern Hemisphere receives the most sunlight and it is summer there. When the pole slants away from the Sun, the Northern Hemisphere receives the least sunlight and it is winter. Spring begins when the pole starts to slant toward the Sun, and autumn begins when the pole starts to slant away again.Astronomers can tell exactly from the Earth's motion around the Sun when one season ends and the next one begins. At the times of the vernal equinox (around 21 March) and the autumnal equinox (around 21 September), the Sun is directly over the equator as seen from the Earth, and the north and south poles are at equal distance from the Sun. Consequently, both hemispheres of the Earth receive equal amounts of light and heat from the Sun at this time. At the time of the summer solstice (around 21 June), the Sun appears directly over the Tropic of Cancer, 23.5 degrees north of the equator. The north pole of the Earth is inclined towards the Sun and the northern hemisphere receives maximum radiation from the Sun. At the time of the winter solstice (around 21 December), the Sun is seen directly overhead from the positions on the Tropic of Capricorn, 23.5 degrees south of the equator. The south pole of the Earth is inclined towards the Sun and the southern hemisphere receives maximum radiation from the Sun. The radiation from the Sun strikes the northern hemisphere of the Earth at a larger angle reducing its ability to warm the northern half of the Earth's surface. The complete sequence from vernal equinox through summer solstice, autumnal equinox, winter solstice back to the vernal equinox signals the beginning and end of a tropical year, the year of the seasons. The temperature and weather do not change instantly in response to the changing position of the Earth in relation to the Sun. The warmest and coldest weather generally occurs several weeks after the beginning of the summer and winter. Heat that has been retained by the oceans plays an important role in producing this delayed response.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.cotf.edu/ete/modules/msese/dinosaurflr/tilt.html <TEXT>The Tilt of Earth's AxisThe second orbital change Milankovitch studied is the tilt of Earth's axis relative to its orbit around the Sun. The tilt of Earth's axis is the main cause of the seasons. If Earth had no tilt, then the length of daylight and the intensity of solar heating seen by a person standing at a single place on the surface would be the same all year round. The area near Earth's equator would still be hotter than the area around the poles, but there would be no seasonal changes in temperature: the Equator would always be hot, the poles would always be cold, and the US would always be blah! But Earth does have a tilt, so on one side of the orbit, the Northern hemisphere is pointed more directly towards the Sun (as seen on the left side of the picture above). On the other side of the orbit, six months later, it is pointed more away from the Sun (as seen on the right side of the picture above). When the Northern hemisphere is pointed towards the Sun, the days are longer, solar heating is more intense, and temperatures are higher - it is summertime! When the Northern hemisphere is pointed away from the sun, the days are shorter, solar heating less intense, and the temperatures are lower - it is winter! (Notice that when the Northern hemisphere is pointed toward the Sun, the Southern hemisphere is pointed away, and vice versa. So when it is summer in the north, it is winter in the south and vice versa.)Milankovitch found that Earth's tilt is not constant, but varies slightly over a cycle that lasts about 41,000 years. The change is small, but when the tilt is less, less snow melts in the polar regions because of the shorter days and reduced sunlight, allowing glaciers to form and spread. When the tilt is greater, more snow melts during the resulting long summers in the polar regions and glaciers tend to shrink.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>??? Can't source<TEXT>Day and night are caused by the spin of the earth. The earth completes one spin around its axis every twenty-four hours. Whenever we are facing the sun, our portion of the earth is illuminated and we experience daytime. Roughly twelve hours later, when we are facing away from the sun, it is dark and we experience nighttime. The fact that the sun always rises in the east and sets in the west is a direct result of the direction of the earth's spin. If the earth happened to spin in the opposite direction, we would witness the sun rising in the west and setting in the east. The terms "sunrise" and "sunset" really aren't indicative of what is actually happening. In the morning, the spin of the Earth is bringing you closer to the sun, and in the evening, it is taking you away from the sun. The sun is just sitting in the same place the whole time. The seasons are also caused by the earth's relationship with the sun. As the earth spins, it also rotates around the sun. Meanwhile, the axis about which the earth spins is tilted. This tilt never changes as the earth circles the sun, which means that sometimes it is facing towards the sun and sometimes it is facing away from the sun. This is easily visualized using a globe (or even just a ball) and a flashlight. This tilt influences the length of days and nights. Think about the extreme situations: the North Pole and the South Pole. When the axis is tilted away from the sun, the North Pole doesn't get any light regardless of the earth's spin. The South Pole, on the other hand, is constantly facing the sun. If you are standing on one of the poles, you will experience six months of light and six months of darkness. The changes in temperature and weather conditions that we associate with seasons are just side effects of these changes in the amount of light we get from the sun. The tilt also explains why the seasons are reversed for the two hemispheres. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere. Again it is easier to picture these phenomena with a globe and flashlight.Procedure: The day before you give this lesson tell the class that you are going to put a light intensity data logger outside for the next twenty-four hours. Ask them what they think will occur. Then launch the HOBO for twenty four-hours (twelve second intervals) and place it on a windowsill (or some other suitable location that receives primarily natural light). In class the next day, ask the students what they think causes night and day. Can they figure it out on their own? Use the flashlight and the globe to demonstrate how the earth's spin causes what we perceive as days and nights. Can the class figure out how fast the earth spins (how long it takes to make one complete revolution)? Take a look at what the HOBO has to say. Transfer the data onto your computer and bring up the graph of light intensity over the past twenty-four hours. If you can, project the image onto a screen that everyone can see clearly. Can the students find sunrise and sunset? Check these time estimates with the values given in the local newspaper or on the Internet. Do they agree? Does the light get brighter over the course of the morning hours and then get darker in the evening? When was the brightest part of the day? What happened to temperature over this time period? Are light intensity and temperature related?When you're done with that activity, ask the students what causes the seasons. Again use the flashlight and the globe to show how the earth orbits the sun. Since the sun is a point source (it emits light in all directions), it might be better to use a light bulb here. Show how the earth is tilted and explain that this tilt causes days to be of different lengths. The seasons are just a side effect of this occurrence. Demonstrate this effect using the two extreme points, the North and South Poles. Explain that the two poles get darkness and light for six months at a time. A computer simulation would be especially useful here if you have the necessary software. Can the students guess how long it takes for the earth to orbit the sun?Analysis: If the days and nights last six months at the poles, does that mean there are places near the poles that get days or weeks of light and dark at a time? Point out the Arctic Circle and the Antarctic Circle. The Arctic Circle marks the southernmost point of the Northern Hemisphere from whence the midnight sun can be observed. The midnight sun is the phenomenon in which the sun can be seen for at least twenty-four consecutive hours. If you live on the Arctic Circle, this event can be witnessed every year on the summer solstice, which occurs around June 22. There is a complementary twenty-four hours of darkness that will occur on the winter solstice. The Arctic Circle is located at 23.5 degrees of latitude from the North Pole. Not by coincidence, this is also the angle of the earth's tilt. Here's a little something for the students to ponder. Neglecting the extreme cases of the two circles, how is the length of the day (the length of time between sunrise and sunset) influenced by latitude? Does longitude play a role? First of all, in answer to the second question, longitude has no effect on the length of the days. In the Northern Hemisphere, we associate north with colder climates and south with colder climates. East and west are more or less irrelevant. This observation should help lead the students to conclude that the days get longer as you approach the equator. In fact, locations on the equator receive twelve hours of sunshine and twelve hours of darkness all year round. You can demonstrate this fact using your globe and flashlight. It doesn't matter where the earth is relative to the sun. The equator will always get an even split of sunshine and darkness.Something Extra: Launch the HOBO for several months (sixteen or twenty-four minute intervals), perhaps until the end of the school year. At the end of this period, take a look at the results. You should be able to find sunrise and sunset for each day. Are the winter days shorter than the fall and spring days? Try graphing the sunrise times and the sunset times. Is the relationship between day of the year and sunrise/sunset linear? At what time of day is the light the brightest? Does this time change with the seasons? Is the sun brighter in the summer than in the winter? If you're going to measure light intensity for all this time, you might as well record temperature as well. Is there a clear relationship between the length of the days and the temperature? How bright was the sun on the warmest day of the year? The coldest day of they year? Does the peak brightness of the sun on a given day have any effect on the temperature? Here's a sample graph of light intensity over a twenty-four hour period. Notice that the intensity at night is not zero, because the moon provides some lightaccording to the National Science Education Standards, children should know how much the Earth tilts on its axis of rotation. We'd like to make this more of a logical discovery from their experiences than one of those facts they are forced to learn for the sake of "science" tests. It has been shown that most adults do not retain this information from their primary school memorization, so this Thread will try a different route to really learning and understanding this fact about our world. Vocabulary words which can be integrated into this Thread are tilt, seasons, clockwise, counter clockwise, equinox, solstice, and year.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.homepage.montana.edu/~geol445/hyperglac/time1/milankov.htm <TEXT>The episodic nature of the Earth's glacial and interglacial periods within  the present Ice Age (the last couple of million years) have been caused primarily by  cyclical changes in the Earth's circumnavigation of the Sun. Variations in the Earth's eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession comprise the three dominant cycles, collectively known  as the Milankovitch Cycles for Milutin Milankovitch, the Serbian astronomer who is  generally credited with calculating their magnitude. Taken in unison, variations in these  three cycles creates alterations in the seasonality of solar radiation reaching the  Earth's surface. These times of increased or decreased solar radiation directly influence  the Earth's climate system, thus impacting the advance and retreat of  Earth's glaciers. It is of primary importance to explain that climate change, and subsequent  periods of glaciation, resulting from the following three variables is not due to the  total amount of solar energy reaching Earth. The three Milankovitch Cycles impact the seasonality  and location of solar energy around the Earth, thus impacting contrasts  between the seasons.EccentricityThe first of the three Milankovitch Cycles is the Earth's eccentricity.  Eccentricity is, simply, the shape of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. This  constantly fluctuating, orbital shape ranges between more and less elliptical (0 to 5%  ellipticity) on a cycle of about 100,000 years. These oscillations, from more elliptic to  less elliptic, are of prime importance to glaciation in that it alters the distance from  the Earth to the Sun, thus changing the distance the Sun's short wave radiation must  travel to reach Earth, subsequently reducing or increasing the amount of radiation  received at the Earth's surface in different seasons. Today a difference of only about 3 percent occurs between aphelion  (farthest point) and perihelion (closest point). This 3 percent difference in distance  means that Earth experiences a 6 percent increase in received solar energy in January than  in July. This 6 percent range of variability is not always the case, however. When the  Earth's orbit is most elliptical the amount of solar energy received at the perihelion  would be in the range of 20 to 30 percent more than at aphelion. Most certainly these  continually altering amounts of received solar energy around the globe result in prominent  changes in the Earth's climate and glacial regimes.  At present the orbital  eccentricity is nearly at the minimum of its cycle.Axial TiltAxial tilt, the second of the three Milankovitch Cycles, is the  inclination of the Earth's axis in relation to its plane of orbit around the Sun.  Oscillations in the degree of Earth's axial tilt occur on a periodicity of 41,000 years  from 21.5 to 24.5 degrees.Today the Earth's axial tilt is about 23.5 degrees, which largely accounts  for our seasons.  Because of the periodic variations of this angle the severity of  the Earth's seasons changes. With less axial tilt the Sun's solar radiation is more evenly  distributed between winter and summer. However, less tilt also increases the difference in  radiation receipts between the equatorial and polar regions. One hypothesis for Earth's reaction to a smaller degree of axial tilt is  that it would promote the growth of ice sheets. This response would be due to a warmer  winter, in which warmer air would be able to hold more moisture, and subsequently produce  a greater amount of snowfall. In addition, summer temperatures would be cooler, resulting  in less melting of the winter's accumulation.   At present, axial tilt is in the  middle of its range.PrecessionThe third and final of the Milankovitch Cycles is Earth's precession.  Precession is the Earth's slow wobble as it spins on axis. This wobbling of the Earth on  its axis can be likened to a top running down, and beginning to wobble back and forth on  its axis. The precession of Earth wobbles from pointing at Polaris (North Star) to  pointing at the star Vega. When this shift to the axis pointing at Vega occurs, Vega would  then be considered the North Star. This top-like wobble, or precession, has a periodicity  of 23,000 years.Due to this wobble a climatically significant alteration must take place.  When the axis is tilted towards Vega the positions of the Northern Hemisphere winter and  summer solstices will coincide with the aphelion and perihelion, respectively. This means  that the Northern Hemisphere will experience winter when the Earth is furthest from the Sun and summer when the Earth is closest to the Sun. This coincidence will result in  greater seasonal contrasts.  At present, the Earth is at perihelion very close to the  winter solstice.SummaryThese variables are only important because the Earth has an asymmetric distribution of landmasses, with virtually all (except Antarctica) located in the Northern Hemisphere.(From NOAA's National Geophysical Data Center)  At times when Northern Hemisphere summers are coolest (farthest from the Sun due to precession and   greatest orbital eccentricity) and winters are warmest (minimum tilt), snow can accumulate on and cover broad areas of northern America and Europe.  At present, only precession is in the glacial mode, with tilt and eccentricity not favorable to glaciationEven when all of the orbital parameters favor glaciation, the increase in winter snowfall and decrease in summer melt would barely enough to trigger glaciation, not to grow large ice sheets.  Ice sheet growth requires the support of positive feedback loops, the most obvious of which is that snow and ice have a much lower albedo than ground and vegetation, thus ice masses tend to reflect more radiation back into space, thus cooling the climate and allowing glaciers to expand.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://hea-www.harvard.edu/ECT/Tilt/tilt.html<TEXT> This repeats some of the Teacher Background from Latitudes and Attitudes. Most of the planets in our Solar System are tilted over on their spin axes. We are not sure why this is so, perhaps it is due to the violent collisions common in the early Solar System when there were thousands of small rogue planets circling the Sun. The Earth tilts over on its axis 23.5  with respect to the axis of the Solar System. This means that the Earth is always "pointing" to one side as it goes around the Sun. So, sometimes the Sun is in the direction that the Earth  is pointing, but not at other times. The effect the tilt has on the Earth is that at some times during the year, Earth's orbit makes the northern hemisphere tilt towards the heat and light of the Sun. The increased height of the Sun above the horizon lengthens the length of time this part of Earth receives daylight as well as the intensity of the light (remember the Me and My Shadow flashlight investigation). This increases the amount of light this area of the world gets, thus the overall temperature there increases, since more time in the light means less time for the land and air to cool down before being lit and hence warmed again. In contrast, at the same time, the southern part of the Earth is receiving less daylight time and less intense light and thus is colder. In the southern hemisphere, they will always have Winter when the north is having Summer, and vice versa. Spring and Fall however are perhaps the most interesting times of the year from an astronomical point of view. The tilt of the Earth is not directed towards or away from the Sun, so it could be said that these seasons are more like what the planet's weather would be like if the Earth did not tilt at all. This also means that if we have some data from the very middle of either the Spring or Fall seasons and also from the very middle of Summer, we could make a comparison between the amount of sunlight and the tilt of the Earth.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.school-for-champions.com/science/earth.htm (close)<TEXT>Our planet--the Earth--is a rotating sphere that orbits the Sun. The Earth's axis of rotation is at a constant tilt with respect to its orbit around the Sun, resulting the change of seasons.  The physical characteristics of the Earth include its size and composition. The Earth also has  gravity and magnetic force fields.Questions you may have include: *  What is the Earth's relationship with the Sun? *  What are the Earth's physical characteristics? *  What do the Earth's force fields do?This lesson will answer your questions and give a basic explanation of the characteristics of the Earth in space. You can take a mini-quiz at the end of the lesson.Relationship with SunThe Earth is the third planet from the Sun, with Mercury and Venus being closer. Its unique position  gives the Earth a temperate climate, allowing the chemical reactions necessary to sustain life.  But over the years, the climate has varied enough to melt the ice caps near the North and South  poles, or to cause glaciers to move south in an Ice Age.Rotates in an orbitThe Earth goes around the Sun in an orbit, taking a year or about  365 days to make one revolution. The orbit is an ellipse, so the Sun is off-center.  The Earth orbits the Sun The average distance from the Sun is 149,597,890 kilometers (92,955,820 miles). This distance  is so great that it takes light about 8 minutes to reach the Earth from the Sun. Spins on its axisThe Earth spins on its axis, making one revolution in 24 hours. The spinning of the Earth on its  axis is what causes the Sun to appear to move across the sky. The effect the apparent movement  of the Sun is similar to looking out the window of a moving car, where things outside appear to  be moving past you. Tilts affects seasonsThe Earth's axis also tilts with respect to the Sun, causing the changes of the seasons. In summer,  the Earth is tilted such that the Sun falls more directly, while in winter the Sun looks lower  in the horizon and the light comes at a glancing angle. The tilt of the Earth also causes the summer  days to be longer than the nights. In winter the days are shorter and there is less light to heat  the ground.The light from the Sun is more direct in summer than in winter at the same latitudeThe further north you go, the more the effect of the tilt is of the Earth is apparent. Above the  Arctic Circle, daylight is can be seen for a full 24 hours in the summer or night can be 24 hours  in the winter. That is why they call the area "the land of the midnight sun." (See Motion of the Earth for more information.) MoonThe Earth has only one moon, while Mars has two moons and Jupiter has 9 moons.(See The Moon for more information.) Physical characteristicsPhysical characteristics include shape, size and composition. Spherical in shapeJust as the Sun and Moon appear as spheres, so too is the Earth spherical in shape. To people  on Earth, the planet appears to be generally flat (not counting for hills and valleys), but in  reality the surface of the Earth has a slight curve. This can be noticed when looking out on a  large lake or the ocean and seeing a ship come up along the horizon.Ship coming up over the horizonThe shape of the Earth has been proven by ships circling the Earth, as well  as from pictures of the Earth taken from the space vehicles. View of Earth from spaceIts shape is actually slightly flattened at the poles.SizeThe diameter of the Earth at the equator is 12,756 km (7,926 miles), and  its circumference or distance around the Earth at the equator is 40,075 km (24,901 miles).CompositionThe composition of the Earth consists of the solid and liquid portion and the atmosphere or gaseous  portion. Solid and liquidThe percentage composition of the Earth's solid and liquid materials (by mass) is:Oxygen is chemically combined with many substances to produce liquid and solid compounds. Although  water (H2O) is a dominant compound on Earth, Hydrogen is not listed above because  of its small mass. Silicon Dioxide (SiO2) is sand, and that compound makes up a large portion of  the Earth's mass. Much of the Iron is in the Earth's core and is responsible for the Earth's magnetic  field. AtmosphereAlthough most people think air is mainly Oxygen, the atmosphere of the Earth  actually consists of 79% Nitrogen (N2), 20% Oxygen (O2) and  1% of other gases such as Carbon Dioxide (CO2).Force fieldsThe Earth has two major force fields: gravity and magnetism.GravityGravity is the force at a distance that attracts objects of mass toward each other. The force  of gravity from the Earth holds down our atmosphere, oceans and everything else.Lost atmosphere Some planets  and moons that have less gravity than Earth have lost their atmosphere because it wasn't sufficient  to hold the gas close to the surface. Escape velocityWhen you throw a ball or shoot a bullet upward, it will slow down due to the Earth's gravity,  until it finally falls back to the ground. You would have to shoot the object at 40,248 km/hr (25,009  mph) for it to escape the Earth's  gravity and fly out into space. This is called the Earth's Escape Velocity.(See Gravity for more information.)Magnetic fieldThe Earth is like a giant magnet with a magnetic pole near the North Pole and the opposite near the South Pole. The north pole of a magnet seeks the North Magnetic Pole. Through the ages, indications are that the poles switched directions. No one is sure why this happened.The rotation of the Earth and the fact that the core of the Earth is made of iron are major factors  in creating the magnetic field. One thing the magnetic field does is to attract charged particles that have been emitted from the Sun. The focusing of these particles at the poles may help to prevent us from being harmed by the high energy particles. These particles cause the air in the upper atmosphere to glow. This is called the northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (aurora australis). (See Magnetism for more information.)In conclusionThe Earth is a sphere that rotates and tilts, causing the effect of days and seasons. It also revolves around the sun in our solar system. It is the third planet from the Sun and possesses a magnetic field.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7y.html<TEXT>Figure 7y-1 illustrates the  basic components that influence the state of the  Earth's climatic system. Changes in the state of  this system can occur externally (from extraterrestrial  systems) or internally (from ocean, atmosphere and  land systems) through any one of the described components.  For example, an external change may involve a variation  in the sun's output which would externally vary the  amount of solar  radiation received by the Earth's atmosphere  and surface. Internal variations in the Earth's climatic  system may be caused by changes in the concentrations  of atmospheric gases, mountain building, volcanic  activity, and changes in surface or atmospheric albedo.Figure  7y-1: Factors  that influence the Earth's climate.The work of climatologists has found  evidence to suggest that only a limited number of  factors are primarily responsible for most of the  past episodes of climate change on the Earth. These  factors include: *  Variations in the Earth's orbital characteristics.  *   Atmospheric carbon dioxide variations.  *   Volcanic eruptions  *   Variations in solar output.   Variations in the Earth's Orbital  CharacteristicsThe Milankovitch theory suggests  that normal cyclical variations in three of the  Earth's orbital characteristics is probably responsible  for some past climatic change. The basic idea  behind this theory assumes that over time these  three cyclic  events vary the amount of solar  radiation that is received on the Earth's  surface.The first cyclical variation, known  as eccentricity,  controls the shape of the Earth's orbit around the  sun. The orbit gradually changes from being elliptical  to being nearly circular and then back to elliptical  in a period of about 100,000 years. The greater the  eccentricity of the orbit (i.e., the more elliptical  it is), the greater the variation in solar energy  received at the top of the atmosphere between the  Earth's closest (perihelion)  and farthest (aphelion)  approach to the sun. Currently, the Earth is experiencing  a period of low eccentricity. The difference in the  Earth's distance from the sun between perihelion  and aphelion (which is only about 3 %) is responsible  for approximately a 7 % variation in the amount of  solar energy received at the top of the atmosphere.  When the difference in this distance is at its maximum  (9 %), the difference in solar energy received is  about 20 %.The second cyclical  variation results from the fact that, as the Earth  rotates on its polar  axis, it wobbles like a spinning top changing  the orbital timing of the equinoxes and solstices (see Figure 7y-2 below).  This effect is known as the precession  of the equinox. The precession  of the equinox has a cycle of approximately  26,000 years. According to illustration A,  the Earth is closer to the sun in January (perihelion) and farther away  in July (aphelion)  at the present time. Because of precession, the  reverse will be true in 13,000 years and the Earth  will then be closer to the sun in July (illustration  B).  This means, of course, that if everything else  remains constant, 13,000 years from now seasonal  variations in the Northern Hemisphere should be  greater than at present (colder winters and warmer  summers) because of the closer proximity of the  Earth to the sun.Figure  7y-2: Modification  of the timing of aphelion and perihelion  over time (A = today; B =  13,000 years into the future). The third cyclical variation is related  to the changes in the tilt (obliquity) of the Earth's axis  of rotation over a 41,000 year period. During the  41,000 year cycle the tilt can deviate from approximately  22.5 to 24.5 . At the present time, the tilt  of the Earth's axis is 23.5 . When the tilt  is small there is less climatic variation between  the summer and winter seasons in the middle and  high latitudes. Winters tend to be milder and summers  cooler. Warmer winters allow for more snow to  fall in the high latitude regions. When the atmosphere  is warmer it has a greater ability to hold water  vapor and therefore more snow is produced at areas  of frontal or orographic  uplift. Cooler summers cause snow and ice  to accumulate on the Earth's surface because less  of this frozen water is melted. Thus, the net effect  of a smaller tilt would be more extensive formation  of glaciers in the polar latitudes. Periods of a larger tilt result in  greater seasonal climatic variation in the middle  and high latitudes. At these times, winters tend  to be colder and summers warmer. Colder winters produce  less snow because of lower atmospheric temperatures.  As a result, less snow and ice accumulates on the ground surface. Moreover, the warmer summers produced  by the larger tilt provide additional energy to melt  and evaporate the snow that fell and accumulated  during the winter months. In conclusion, glaciers  in the polar regions should be generally receding,  with other contributing factors constant, during  this part of the obliquity cycle.Computer models and historical evidence  suggest that the Milankovitch cycles exert their  greatest cooling and warming influence when the troughs and peaks of all three cycles coincide with each  other. Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide VariationsStudies of long term climate change  have discovered a connection between the concentration  of carbon  dioxide in the atmosphere and mean global temperature. Carbon dioxide is one of the more important  gases responsible for the greenhouse  effect. Certain atmospheric gases, like carbon dioxide, water vapor and methane,  are able to alter the energy balance of the Earth  by being able to absorb longwave radiation emitted  from the Earth's surface. The net result of this  process and the re-emission of longwave back to  the Earth's surface increases the quantity of heat  energy in the Earth's climatic system. Without  the greenhouse effect, the average global temperature  of the Earth would be a cold -18  Celsius rather than the present 15  Celsius.Researchers of the 1970s CLIMAP  project found strong evidence in deep-ocean  sediments of variations in the Earth's global  temperature during the past several hundred thousand  years of the Earth's history. Other subsequent  studies have confirmed these findings and have  discovered that these temperature variations  were closely correlated to the concentration  of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and variations  in solar radiation received by the planet as  controlled by the Milankovitch cycles. Measurements  indicated that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels  were about 30 % lower during colder glacial periods.  It was also theorized that the oceans were a  major store of carbon dioxide and that they controlled  the movement of this gas to and from the atmosphere.  The amount of carbon dioxide that can be held  in oceans is a function of temperature. Carbon  dioxide is released from the oceans when global  temperatures become warmer and diffuses into  the ocean when temperatures are cooler. Initial  changes in global temperature were triggered  by changes in received solar radiation by the  Earth through the Milankovitch cycles. The increase  in carbon dioxide then amplified the global warming  by enhancing the greenhouse effect.Over the past three centuries, the  concentration of carbon dioxide has been increasing  in the Earth's atmosphere because of human influences  (Figure 7y-3). Human activities like the  burning of fossil fuels, conversion of natural  prairie to farmland, and deforestation have caused  the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  From the early 1700s, carbon dioxide has increased  from 280 parts per million to 360 parts per million  in 1990. Many scientists believe that higher concentrations  of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will enhance  the greenhouse effect making the planet warmer. Scientists believe we are already experiencing  global warming due to an enhancement of the greenhouse  effect. Most computer climate models suggest that  the globe will warm up by 1.5 - 4.5  Celsius  if carbon dioxide reaches the predicted level of  600 parts per million by the year 2050.Figure  7y-3: The  following graph illustrates the rise in atmospheric  carbon dioxide from 1744 to 1992. Note that  the increase in carbon dioxide's concentration  in the atmosphere has been exponential during  the period examined. An extrapolation  into the immediate future would suggest continued  increases.Volcanic EruptionsFor many years, climatologists have  noticed a connection between large explosive volcanic eruptions  and short term climatic change (Figure 7y-4). For example, one of the coldest years in the last  two centuries occurred the year following the Tambora  volcanic eruption in 1815. Accounts of very cold  weather were documented in the year following this  eruption in a number of regions across the planet.  Several other major volcanic events also show a pattern  of cooler global temperatures lasting 1 to 3 years  after their eruption.Figure  7y-4: Explosive  volcanic eruptions have been shown to have  a short-term cooling effect on the atmosphere  if they eject large quantities of sulfur dioxide  into the stratosphere. This image shows the  eruption of Mount St. Helens on May 18, 1980  which had a local effect on climate because  of ash reducing the reception of solar radiation  on the Earth's surface. Mount St. Helens had  very minimal global effect on the climate because  the eruption occurred at an oblique angle putting  little sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere. (Source: U.S.  Geological Survey, photograph by Austin Post).  At first, scientists thought that the  dust emitted into the atmosphere from large volcanic  eruptions was responsible for the cooling by partially blocking the transmission of solar  radiation to the Earth's surface. However,  measurements indicate that most of the dust thrown  in the atmosphere returned to the Earth's surface  within six months. Recent stratospheric data  suggests that large explosive volcanic eruptions  also eject large quantities of sulfur  dioxide gas which remains in the atmosphere  for as long as three years. Atmospheric chemists  have determined that the ejected sulfur dioxide gas  reacts with water vapor commonly found in the stratosphere  to form a dense optically bright haze layer that  reduces the atmospheric transmission of some of the  sun's incoming radiation. In the last century, two significant  climate modifying eruptions have occurred. El Chichon  in Mexico erupted in April of 1982, and Mount Pinatubo went off in the Philippines during June, 1991 (Figure  7y-5). Of these two volcanic events, Mount Pinatubo  had a greater effect on the Earth's climate and ejected  about 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the  stratosphere (Figure 7y-6). Researchers believe  that the Pinatubo eruption was primarily responsible  for the 0.8 degree Celsius drop in global average  air temperature in 1992. The global climatic effects  of the eruption of Mount Pinatubo are believed to  have peaked in late 1993. Satellite data confirmed  the connection between the Mount Pinatubo eruption  and the global temperature decrease in 1992 and 1993.  The satellite data indicated that the sulfur dioxide  plume from the eruption caused a several percent  increase in the amount of sunlight reflected by the  Earth's atmosphere back to space causing the surface  of the planet to cool.Figure  7y-5: Ash  column generated by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo  on June 12, 1991. The strongest eruption of  Mount Pinatubo occurred three days later on  June 15, 1991. (Source: US  Geological Survey).  Figure  7y-6: The  following satellite image shows the distribution  of Mount Pinatubo's sulfur dioxide and dust aerosol plume (red and yellow areas) between  June 14 and July 26, 1991. Approximately  45 days after the eruption, the aerosol  plume completely circled the Earth around  the equator forming a band 20 to 50  of latitude wide. Areas outside this band  were clear of volcanic aerosols. Within  a year, the sulfur dioxide continued to  migrate towards the North and South Pole  until it covered the entire Earth because  of the dominant poleward flow of stratospheric  winds (stratospheric winds circulate from  the equator to the polar vortices at the  North and South Poles). These observed  patterns of aerosol movement suggest that  tropical explosive volcanic eruptions probably  have the greatest effect on the Earth's  climate. Diffusion of aerosols by stratospheric  winds from a tropical source results in  the greatest latitudinal coverage of the  sulfur dioxide across both the Northern  and Southern Hemispheres. (Source: SAGE  II Satellite Project - NASA).  Variations in Solar OutputUntil recently, many scientists thought  that the sun's output of radiation only varied by  a fraction of a percent over many years. However, measurements made by satellites equipped with radiometers in  the 1980s and 1990s suggested that the sun's  energy output may be more variable than was once  thought (Figure 7y-7). Measurements made  during the early 1980s showed a decrease of 0.1  percent in the total amount of solar energy reaching  the Earth over just an 18 month time period. If  this trend were to extend over several decades,  it could influence global climate. Numerical climatic  models predict that a change in solar output of  only 1 percent per century would alter the Earth's  average temperature by between 0.5 to 1.0  Celsius.Figure  7y-7: The  sun as seen at sunset. The sun is essentially  the only source of energy for running the Earth's climate. Thus any change in its output will  result in changes in the reception of insolation  and the generation of heat energy which drives  the climate system.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.esse.ou.edu/fund_concepts/Fundamental_Concepts1/Solar_System/Earths_Rotation.htm<TEXT>Earth rotates around its axis (in a counter-clockwise direction, when viewed looking down on the North Pole), producing sequential periods of daylight and night. The period of rotation defines the day, one of Earth's natural time scales. Earth's rate of rotation is relatively rapid, that is, there are many rotations (days) in one revolution (year).  Earth's rotation axis is currently tilted at ~23.5  with respect to the ecliptic axis, the line drawn from the center of the Earth and perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. This tilt is called the obliquity of Earth's axis. As a large rotating mass, Earth acts like a gyroscope as it revolves around the Sun, that is, at every point along its orbit, its axis of rotation points toward the same fixed point in distant space. On the celestial sphere, that point is very near the star Polaris, commonly called the "North Star". The both the magnitude and the orientation of the tilt of the rotation axis change slowly over time. The change in orientation of the tilt is due to a wobble in Earth's rotation axis. Seasons The tilt of Earth's rotation axis is the primary cause of the seasons. The seasons modulate how much solar radiation is received at a point on Earth's surface through the course of a year.   This modulation is strongest at high (polar) latitudes and less at low (tropical) latitudes.Earth's rotation gives rise to ... ... a centrifugal force, which causes the bulge of the equator (and the attendant flattening of the polar regions), relative to a perfect sphere. ... a coriolis force, which is important in determining the flow of jet streams in the atmosphere and currents in the ocean. "Wobbling" of Earth's Axis of Rotation (Axial Nutation and Axial Precession) As noted above, Earth's rotation axis presently points toward the distant star called Polaris. However, the other bodies in the Solar System -- especially the Moon -- are constantly perturbing Earth's rotation through gravitational interactions. Just like a spinning top that is perturbed, Earth wobbles slightly. To first order, over time the rotation axis ... ... bobs up and down (axial nutation) by 9.18" with a period of 18.6 years (this is a very small effect). ... rotates slowly clockwise about the ecliptic axis (axial precession), completing a circuit around a circle centered on the ecliptic axis every ~ 25,700 years (this is a large, albeit very slow effect).  This wobbling is independent of the Earth revolving around its orbit. Axial precession determines where along the orbit the various seasons occur. The seasons very slowly slip counter-clockwise along the orbit.It is just by chance that humanity has reached the level of technology that is has when the Northern Hemisphere winter solstice is near aphelion.If we look 13,000 years in the future (or equivalently, 13,000 years in the past), the rotation axis points toward the star a-Lyrae. All other factors being the same, Northern Hemisphere winter solstice now occurs near perihelion! This will likely make Northern Hemisphere winters more severe.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.eoearth.org/article/Causes_of_climate_change<TEXT> Scientists have long tried to also  link sunspots to  climatic change (also see the link www.sunspotcycle.com).  Sunspots are huge magnetic storms that are seen  as dark (cooler) areas on the sun's surface. The  number and size of sunspots show cyclical patterns,  reaching a maximum about every 11, 90, and 180  years. The decrease in solar energy observed in  the early 1980s correspond to a period of maximum  sunspot activity based on the 11 year cycle. In  addition, measurements made with a solar telescope  from 1976 to 1980 showed that during this period,  as the number and size of sunspots increased, the  sun's surface cooled by about 6  Celsius. Apparently,  the sunspots prevented some of the sun's energy  from leaving its surface. However, these findings  tend to contradict observations made on longer  times scales. Observations of the sun during the  middle of the Little Ice Age (1650 to 1750) indicated  that very little sunspot activity was occurring on  the sun's surface. The Little  Ice Age was a time of a much cooler global  climate and some scientists correlate this occurrence  with a reduction in solar activity over a period  of 90 or 180 years. Measurements have shown that  these 90 and 180 year cycles influence the amplitude  of the 11 year sunspot cycle. It is hypothesized  that during times of low amplitude, like the Maunder  Minimum, the sun's output of radiation is  reduced. Observations by astronomers during this  period (1645 to 1715) noticed very little sunspot  activity occurring on the sun.During periods of maximum sunspot activity,  the sun's magnetic field is strong. When sunspot  activity is low, the sun's magnetic field weakens.  The magnetic field of the sun also reverses every  22 years, during a sunspot minimum. Some scientists  believe that the periodic droughts on the Great Plains  of the United States are in someway correlated with  this 22 year cycle.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.astrosociety.org/education/publications/tnl/29/season6.html<TEXT> The annual seasonal cycle is one example of how celestial events affect the Earth. Tides, caused largely by the gravity of the Moon, are another example. But the Moon has another influence on the Earth that cause changes noticeable only over longer periods of time.  This influence depends on the fact the Earth isn't exactly a sphere. Since the Earth rotates quickly (1,000 miles an hour at the equator), centrifugal force causes the equator to bulge out and the poles to flatten by a small amount; the same thing happens to a water balloon when you spin it rapidly. The Moon's gravity yanks on the bulging equator. This wouldn't matter if the Moon orbit was aligned with the Earth's equator. But the Moon does not orbit exactly in the Earth's equatorial plane -- it's inclined by about 5 degrees -- and consequently it tries to change the tilt of the Earth.  The Earth's spin resists this change. The tug-of-war between spin and Moon causes the Earth's axis to precess, or wobble. It's the same effect that makes a spinning top wobble: Gravity wants to make the top fall over, and it would if it weren't spinning, but rotation stabilizes the top -- and the result is that the spin axis precesses. In the case of the Earth, the spin axis completes precesses once every 26,000 years.  This precession has two consequences. First, because the axis is moving, the star that is closest to the celestial north pole (extending the Earth's pole out into space) changes. At present, the pole star is Polaris, but by A.D. 14,000 the celestial pole will be close to Vega. Around 3,000 B.C., the pole star was Thuban in the constellation Draco.  Second, precession moves the position of the equinoxes on the sky. The spring equinox occurs when the path of the Sun on the sky crosses the Earth's equatorial plane moving north. Civilizations with astronomical knowledge have used the vernal equinox to signal the beginning of spring. For the ancient Babylonians, the vernal equinox was in the constellation of Taurus; now it is in Pisces, and soon it will cross into Aquarius -- hence the "dawning of the age of Aquarius." This precession is so rapid that astronomers, who use a coordinate system on the sky based on the location of the Earth's pole, must constantly correct for the effect.  The Earth is affected not only by the Moon, but also by the other planets. Over hundreds of thousands of years, the gravitational pull of the other planets causes small oscillations both in the tilt of the Earth's orbit and in how elliptical the orbit is. As the orbit changes, the average amount of sunlight that the Earth receives over a year varies slightly.  This is the basis of the Milankovitch theory of climate change. In this theory, changes in the overall climate, such as the ice ages, are caused by changes in the amount of sunlight received due to variations in the Earth's orbit. Even though the changes are small, the climate is so finely balanced that they can develop into noticeable effects. During times of reduced sunlight, temperatures drop, and the Earth enters an ice age, a sort of superwinter. Right now, it's supersummer.  The Earth's climate is so complicated, however, that this theory is still controversial. Other hypotheses for climate cycles have been put forward, but many of them also involve changes in the Earth's orbit. It's one example of how interaction with the rest of the solar system has had profound consequences for life on Earth.  The Traditional Seasons of Pohnpei Pohnpei is a beautiful green island of coconut palms, crystal ocean, cool breezes, and tropical sunsets, located near the equator 4,600 kilometers (2,900 miles) southwest of Hawaii. About 32,000 people live there, and despite the cultural changes of the 20th century, they have held onto their traditional lore, especially of the seasons.  The lore, collected and compiled by Stewo Gallen at the Pohnpeian Department of Education, designates two seasons: rahk and isol. Rahk runs from March to September, the rainy season on Pohnpei. It is the traditional season of plenty, when the breadfruit ripens. Five traditional feasts during rahk honor the breadfruit.  Isol runs from September through March, the dry season. Historically this is the time of little food, or even famine. Six traditional feasts during  isol honor various types of yam. There are 177 locally recognized varieties of yam on Pohnpei, probably more than you'll find at your local supermarket.  Pohnpeians are mostly farmers and fishermen, and their traditional calendar is suited to their needs. The calendar has 10 months. Each is 36 or 37 days long and shares its name with a bright star or group of stars prominent during that month. The months are closely tied to the tribute feasts for the yam and breadfruit, and also denote the appearance of strong trade winds and the traditional times to catch certain types of fish.  The Pohnpeian days are based on the phases of the Moon. There are 30 Moon days corresponding to the phase. If you told someone that it was the day Rotenpahwel of the month Daliaram, they would know it was a good day to catch coconut crabs. Rotenpahwel is two days after full Moon, when the tides are at their highest and lowest for any month, and Daliaram occurs in late December and January when the tides are at their highest and lowest for the year. Coconut crabs, one of the island's greatest culinary delicacies, must return to the water to lay their eggs and they do so at the time of highest high and lowest low tides. Like the seasons, the calendar reflects the closeness of the Pohnpeian people to the land and sea.  PAMELA EASTLICK is the planetarium coordinator at the University of Guam in Mangilao.

Snider, Oberlin College  This device accurately models the motion of the Sun as seen from any place in the Northern Hemisphere at any time of year. Notice the way the months are spread out along the MONTH part of the frame. The region they occupy is determined by the 23.5 degree tilt of the Earth's axis with respect to the plane of its orbit about the Sun. If the tilt were greater, the months would be spread out more along the frame; if it were less, they would be crowded closer together.  The compass disk represents a part of the surface of the Earth. You can imagine a tiny observer (standing on the black dot at the center of the disk) looking out at the horizon in any direction. The round head of the paper fastener represents the Sun. Setting the paper fastener at the desired month adjusts for the time of year. Swinging the frame from east to west moves the Sun in its apparent daily path through the sky. The LATITUDE part of the frame is used to adjust the compass disk to put the imaginary observer at any latitude from the equator (0 degrees) to the north pole (90 degrees).  Hold the device in your left hand so that the green compass disk is horizontal. Imagine that you are standing in the middle of a large open field, at the location of the black dot, with a clear horizon all around you. The geographical directions are marked around the horizon. With your right hand, smoothly swing around the part of the frame which carries the paper-fastener Sun. When the head of the paper-fastener lies below the compass disk, the Sun lies below the horizon, and so it is night where you are. As the head of the paper-fastener passes the edge of the compass disk, the Sun rises, at a definite location around the horizon. As you continue to swing the frame, the Sun gets higher in the sky, reaches a maximum height, gets lower, and finally sets at some definite location on the horizon.  Here are a few ways to use the Solar Motion Demonstrator:  1.    At what times of year are the lengths of day and night equal? On the vernal equinox in March and fall equinox in September, the Sun rises due east and sets due west at every latitude. 2.   What are the relative lengths of day and night? Swing the piece carrying the Sun around at a constant rate, over its entire range. This corresponds to one rotation of the Earth, taking 24 hours. The Sun lies above the horizon for part of this motion (daytime) and below it for the remainder (nighttime). From this, you can estimate the relative lengths of day and night. 3.   What are the reasons for the Earth's seasons? Move the paper fastener to its June position. Swing the Sun and observe the relative lengths of day and night and the maximum height of the Sun. Do the same with the Sun down in its December position. This demonstrates the two most important factors responsible for the seasons: the length of the day and the angle at which sunlight strikes the ground. 4.   Where on Earth does the Sun remain above the horizon for 24 hours? Explore the range of latitudes and times of year for which the paper-fastener Sun remains above the compass disk as you swing it through its entire daily motion. This corresponds to a 24-hour day, with the Sun above the horizon at midnight! Places for which this is true are the "Land of the Midnight Sun". For an observer north of the so-called Arctic Circle at 66.5 degrees latitude, the Sun will never set on at least one day of the year.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080424211717AAFXZHk (just part of it)<TEXT>the Earth rotates once a day about its axis between the north and south poles, it revolves about the Sun in its orbit but once a year. The seasons are caused by the simple fact that the Earth's axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the plane of its orbit. Rather, the Earth's axis is tilted some 23 .5 away from the perpendicular, as shown in the figure (which is NOT to scale). As the Earth orbits the Sun, the orientation of its rotational axis is held fixed, so that if we imagine it extended into space, it is always pointing towards Polaris, the pole star. As the Earth orbits around the Sun, for a portion of the year the Sun is in the same direction as the tilt happens to be. In other words, the Earth is in a part of its orbit where its tilt direction is towards the direction of the Sun. This means that the Northern Hemisphere will have warmer temperatures and hence summer. For the other portion of the year, the Earth has moved around the Sun, putting the Sun not in the direction in which the tilt happens to be. In other words, the tilt direction is off into space behind the Earth (towards the outer planets). With the top of the Earth now tilted away from the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere can enjoy summer. There are, of course, times in between as the Earth is orbiting when it has the Sun neither towards or away from the direction of the tilt. These times are when no hemisphere is experiencing any greater amount of sunlight than another, and so this is Spring or Fall for the hemispheres. This chapter investigates both the causes and the effects of the changing of the seasons. We start simply by trying to quantify the observation "it's colder in the winter" and end by measuring the tilt of the Earth itself! Topic 1: Observations of The Seasons If you ask students what a particular season means to them, they'll probably mention the weather usually associated with it. Summer is hot. Winter is cold. Spring and Fall are in between. (For those of us living close enough to the poles, winter means snow, too!) A common misconception (even among a disturbingly large number of college graduates) is that the Earth is closer to the Sun during the summer, causing summer's warmer temperatures. This model, of course, is inconsistent with the fact that while the Northern Hemisphere has summer, the Southern Hemisphere has winter. Furthermore, while it's summer for the Northern Hemisphere, the Earth is actually slightly farther away from the Sun than during the winter. As we know, during the Northern summer, the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun. During the winter, it is tilted away. This tilt causes the Sun to appear higher in the sky during the summer than during the winter. The higher Sun causes more hours of daylight and more intense, direct sunlight, or hotter conditions on the surface of the Earth. Questions to ask the class include: How is summer different from winter? What changes as winter gives way to spring? What changes are there as summer becomes fall? What about when winter approaches? Activity 2-1: The Sun's Changing Path  The shadow stick measurements (Topic 2, "Sun Shadows") and measurements of the Sun's path on a dome (Topic 3, "Tracking the Sun Path in the Sky") from the previous chapter can be continued from week to week and month to month to show seasonal changes. Both will illustrate that the Sun follows a higher arc through the sky in the summer than in the winter. A comparison of shadow lengths all measured at midday will show that the shadow lengths increase as winter approaches becoming longest about December 21 (the shortest day) and then decrease again until June 21 (the longest day). One way to keep track of the shadow lengths is to draw a graph by hand or on the computer. The plot should have midday shadow length (on the vertical axis) versus the date of the observation (on the horizontal axis). Each week, make a new measurement and update the graph. The measurements on the dome require more time, but provide a much better record of the Sun's path through the sky during more of the day rather than just at midday. Repeating the dome measurements each month (perhaps using the same plastic dome with different colored markers) will very clearly record the changes in the Sun's path through the sky during the year.Activity 2-2: Recording Daily Temperatures  Weather is the result of an almost incalculable number of events. As such, it would be folly to attempt to predict a given city's temperature for a given date, far into the future. It would be equally foolish to point to an exceptionally cold day in June and declare "Winter's coming!" There are just too many variables for such a simplistic view. However, hidden among the randomness are trends which can be measured, and from which conclusions like "winter's coming" can be made. The class can measure the outside temperature at a particular time each day, perhaps noon or lunch time. From newspapers or broadcast newscasts, the class can collect local high and low temperature readings for each day. These can be plotted on a graph or entered into a data base. For younger students, a classroom chart with cartoon thermometers with daily temperature marks can be made. The exact form of this activity is not important. One should emphasize the importance of recording data in an appropriate way. Sometimes making a simple graph can explain pages and pages of numbers. Simplicity is the key. With clear presentation of data, it is much easier to move forward and, for example, correlate the temperature measurements with the shadow stick and dome measurements. Activity 2-3: Tracking Sunrise and Sunset Times  The tilt of the Earth in its orbit about the Sun affects not only the intensity of the solar radiation at a given location, but also the number of daylight hours. These two effects combine to create the weather we usually associate with each season. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Summer Solstice (longest day, shortest night) occurs around June 21. From June 21 to December 21, the days grow shorter and the nights longer. There are two equinoxes, during which the hours of daylight and night are equal: the Vernal Equinox (around March 21) and the Autumnal Equinox (around September 22). One can observe these changes by recording the times of sunrise and sunset and measuring the length of the day. Changes in these times are large enough (about a minute a day) to be seen on a graph. The figure below shows such a graph made from sunrise and sunset times at the National Optical Astronomical Observatory located on Kitt Peak near Tucson, Arizona for September to December. If begun in September and continued through the Winter Solstice (about December 22), the graph should show the gradual decrease in the number of daylight hours (in the Northern hemisphere) with the minimum at the Winter Solstice. It would be interesting to include either of the equinoxes on the graph as well.Materials: Large paper from roll (3'X6'); markers; yardstick; pencil; circle labels; paints; adhesive dots; daily local newspaper. *  1. On a large sheet of paper, make a grid on which to plot the sunrise and sunset times. The time of day should run along the vertical axis, leaving about one inch for every hour. The date of the observation will be recorded along the horizontal axis. *   2. Look up the times of sunrise and sunset in a daily newspaper. Plot these times on the graph, marking the points with adhesive dots. After plotting for several weeks, connect the dots with a line. *   3. Optional: These coordinates can be stored and plotted with a computer spreadsheet like AppleWorks.Discussion  The figure below shows a plot of sunrise and sunset times  taken once a week from September through December. Notice  that the shortest day occurs around December 21, as expected. In order to reinforce the connection between the number of daylight hours and average daily temperature, try making a wall-sized chart combining sunrise-sunset data with the daily temperature, as collected in the previous activity. While daily fluctuations in the temperature will be apparent, it is the general trends which we seek. How does the length of the day change with season? Does the daily temperature match this trend also? Activity 2-4: The Analemma  This simple, long-term activity provides an easy way to record the changes of the Sun's apparent motion. We already know that the Earth's tilt causes the Sun's path to be higher in the sky during the summer than in the winter. Because the Earth's orbit around the Sun is not perfectly circular, the Sun's position at a specific time (as given by the clock) changes Eastwardly and Westerwardly as well. By reflecting sunlight onto the classroom ceiling and marking the Sun's position at the same time every week, we can record the change of the Sun's apparent motion, and after a year should notice a figure-eight-like figure known as an analemma.Be sure to remind students that looking at the Sun can cause permanent eye damage-Never look directly at the Sun!Materials: Southern window with direct sunlight; small mirror; masking tape; adhesive dots (optional) *  1. Choose a Southern window with direct sunlight which will remain unblocked throughout the year. *   2. Place a very small mirror on the window sill and adjust so the sunlight shines on a clear area of the ceiling (without lights, mobiles, etc.). A mirror only an inch across is adequate. It is best to be able to tape the mirror there permanently, but at the very least, mark the mirror's position with masking tape. (If the reflection from a permanently-mounted mirror becomes distracting during the rest of the day, simply cover it with a sheet of paper). *   3. Once or twice a week, at exactly the same time by the clock, mark the location of the Sun's reflection on the ceiling with an adhesive dot or a piece of masking tape (watch out for Daylight Savings Time changes- adjust the time so that you always make measurements in the same time reference, Standard Time). *   4. Record the date and time of the observation on the marker. Discussion  Where would the spot of sunshine be if the Sun were lower in the sky? Higher? more Easterly? more Westerly? How much does the Sun appear to move each week? Is this change constant throughout the year? After we have measured for a year, could we use the previous year's analemma as a rough calendar? Would it work for every day or are there some periods of ambiguity? When are they? The analemma is longer in one direction than in the other. This longer variation is caused by the seasonal motion of the Sun's path. The other variation (east-west) is the drift of solar time to the average solar time due to the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. (Eccentricity, while precisely defined, can be thought of as an ellipse's lack of circularity- for more information on planetary orbits, see Chapter 4 on The Solar System) If the Earth's orbit were perfectly circular, there would be no east-west drift, and the analemma would be reduced to a line, corresponding to the longer axis of the observed analemma! Topic 2: Summer and Winter SunlightIt is important to note that even without the tilt of the Earth, there would still be variations in temperature from one location to another, caused mainly by the curvature of the earth. Locations closer to the equator would still, on the average, be warmer than locations closer to the poles. Light and heat (radiation) from the Sun would still strike polar regions at more of an angle than nearer the Equator . This angle tends to "spread out" the same amount of energy over a larger area, thereby decreasing its intensity and the amount of heat it brings to the Earth. The activities in this topic demonstrate and test this assertion.Activity 2-5: Energy from the Sun Solar radiation is emitted in various forms which travel at the speed of light. Light travels through space as waves of different lengths. Our eyes can only see radiation as visible light, but radiation also occurs as radio waves, infrared rays, ultraviolet rays, X-rays and gamma rays. Together these waves make up the electromagnetic spectrum. Most of the radiation is "visible" - no coincidence!Questions to ask: How can we measure the warmth from the Sun? Is it possible to find a way to measure it outside? What could we use and how could we show differences in temperature? How long would we have to wait until we take a comparative reading? Can we predict the variations? What might influence fluctuations in warmth? What experiences have students had which help in these predications? Will soil be warmer or colder than air temperature? Does this change during the day? Materials: Thermometers; soil; sunlight; cardboard; stick; glue; pencils; flashlight; paper *  1. Students (in small groups) predict the time of day and comparison reading times with most pronounced variables in temperature. They choose an appropriate spot to insert a thermometer(s) in the earth. They make and place a sign signifying experiment areas. *   2. They return at various intervals to read and record the time and temperature. *   3. Students compare their predictions and the actual readings. *   4. They read and record the temperature of the air at the same time as the recordings of the earth temperature and compare these. *   5. These experiments may be repeated in a few months. This data may then be recorded and compared to earlier readings. Discussion Students discuss results of these experiments. What caused the highest or hottest temperature? Was this related to the time of day? What were students able to discover from their measurements? How accurate were their predictions? What factors helped them to predict well? What conclusions can they make about the effect of the Sun's rays on the Earth? If done at intervals over a period of time, did earlier experiments help their predictions? Students may make a graph using this information either on graph paper or on the Bank Street Filer or on the database of AppleWorks. What other elements could students use to measure temperature? How could we devise an experiment to predict and record the temperature of water or sand in the sunlight? Student may predict and then test the model, record date and compare the results.Activity 2-6: How Angle Spreads a Flashlight BeamThis activity requires a darkened room. You may want to do this as a large group activity for younger students. Older students should try it in small groups and compare their results. Does the illuminated spot on the graph paper always remain the same size? When is it larger? smaller? Is the spot always the same brightness? When is it brighter? fainter? Materials: Graph paper; cardboard or plywood; masking tape; flashlight; markers. *  1. Attach a sheet of graph paper to the cardboard or plywood with the masking tape. Hold the board perpendicular to the floor and shine the flashlight directly onto the graph paper from the side, about two feet away. Be sure the flashlight is parallel to the floor, and, therefore, perpendicular to the paper. You might try placing the flashlight on a pile of books. *   2. Trace the outline of the flashlight's beam on the graph paper. *   3. Keeping the same distance from the paper to the flashlight, try rocking the board towards and then away from the flashlight. Does the area of the beam on the paper increase or decrease? Tilt the board at a large angle like 45  or 60  and trace the new outline of the beam with a different color. Try a couple of other angles, marking the outlines with different colors. *   4. By counting the squares on the graph paper enclosed or partially enclosed by the circle of light, you can quantify the observation that more area is covered by the beam when the board is tilted at larger angles. Discussion  No matter how the board is tilted, nothing changes the amount of light which the flashlight produces. When the board is tilted, and the flashlight illuminates a larger area of the graph paper, the same amount of light energy must be spread over a larger area. The lighting is then less intense. Is there any difference between tilting the board and tilting the flashlight? What if we were using a larger, hotter light source, like a halogen lamp, or a star? Wouldn't the heat carried also be less intense when the board is tilted at larger angles? The next activity explores just this question using the closest star, the Sun.Activity 2-7: How Angle Spreads SunlightThis activity requires a sunny day and direct sunlight.Be sure to remind students that looking at the Sun can cause permanent eye damage-Never look directly at the Sun! This activity is similar to the previous activity in that it shows how light falling upon a tilted surface is less intense than if it were falling directly. With light comes the energy to heat. This activity examines this "spreading out" of light by measuring how quickly and how much sunlight can warm two sheets of paper, one tilted, one not.Materials: Two sheets of black construction paper; two pieces of cardboard or plywood; bricks or blocks to prop up board; masking tape; two thermometers. *  1. Cut an inch-wide slit in the middle of each piece of construction paper. Tape one sheet of black construction paper to each of the cardboard or plywood boards. Place a thermometer into each slit such that the bulb is between the board and the paper, and the scale can be read without removing the thermometer. Tape the thermometers in place. Leave the assembled thermometers in the shade long enough so that they read the same outside temperature. *   2. Tilt one board so that it faces the Sun and the Sun's rays fall nearly perpendicular to the board. The other should be flat on the ground, or even tilted slightly backwards from the Sun if the Sun is especially high in the sky. *   3. Periodically (every minute or so) record the temperature on each thermometer until the temperatures level off and stop climbing. Let the thermometers sit for a few minutes. Record their final temperatures. Discussion Which paper was heated more quickly? Which got warmer? You might want to try different angles. Beware the effects of clouds and wind, as well as the shadows of over-anxious students! What do the results of this experiment tell you about the changes in temperature from Activity 2-5? What was the angle of the Sun when the temperature dropped? When the temperature was the highest? Activity 2-8: Sunlight on a Curved SurfaceThis activity requires a darkened room. We have already seen how the angle at which light strikes a surface affects its intensity. This activity will demonstrate that light shining on a curved surface may be more intense in one place than in others. If we shine a light on a uniformly colored ball, like a dodge ball or kick ball, the area experiencing more intense illumination will appear brighter than those receiving less intense light.Materials: Slide or overhead projector or other source of directed light such as a bright flashlight; large, uniformly colored dodge or kick ball; books to lift light source to desired height *  1. Place the ball on a table. Aim the light source such that it shines directly on the center of the ball, but be sure the beam is wide enough to illuminate the entire ball at once. *   2. Examine the brightness of the light across the surface of the ball. Rotate the ball. What happens to the bright spot? Does it follow the ball's rotation, or does it always face the light source? *   3. Experiment with changing the orientation of the ball, the light, or both. Can you provide even illumination of the ball? Why not? Discussion Where on the ball was the light the brightest? Where was it the faintest? If you changed the orientation of the ball, what parts would be brightest? Which would be faintest? What if you moved the light source?Activity 2-9: Sunlight on the Curved EarthThis activity duplicates the previous activity using a globe of the Earth instead of a plain ball. It, too, requires a darkened room.  The previous activity demonstrated that the curvature of an object can cause different areas of the surface to receive light of differing intensities. This activity shows that the Earth is subject to this effect as well. We have seen in our earlier thermometer experiment that less intense light cannot heat a surface as quickly or as completely as intense, direct light. Therefore, we can predict that there should be areas of the Earth where the sunlight is more intense than at others. These areas should be warmer than other areas. This is why locations near the Equator are generally warmer than those closer to the Poles. Our observations show that the Sun is higher in the sky during the summer than during the winter. Summer approaches for a given hemisphere (North or South) when the Earth moves to a place in its orbit in which that hemisphere's Pole (North or South) is tilted towards the Sun. This causes the Sun to be higher in the sky and its light to be more intense (less spread out). This more intense summer sunlight is better able to heat the land, air, and water. This warming is certainly consistent with our observations of the seasons.Materials: Slide or overhead projector or other source of directed light such as a bright flashlight; large globe of the Earth; books to lift light source to desired height *  1. Place the globe on a table with the North Pole upward. Aim the light source such that it shines directly on the center of the globe, but be sure the beam is wide enough to illuminate the entire globe at once. *   2. Notice that the light appears brighter towards the equator of the Earth. This configuration, with neither Pole tipped towards the Sun corresponds to the equinoxes (strictly speaking, the Earth's axis is still tilted by 23 .5 with respect to its orbit but on an equinox, that tilt is sideways with respect to the Sun, and not towards or away from it). *   3. Try tilting the North Pole by about 23 .5 towards and away from the light source (the angular distance between noon and one o'clock on a clock's face is 30 , so don't exceed this angle). *   4. The previous chapter's activity "Day and Night on the Spinning Globe" could be repeated with a tilted Earth, to measure the variation of sunrise and sunset times with season angle. Discussion Does the bright area move across the face of the Earth? How should the globe be positioned to show winter? summer? spring? fall? Topic 3: The Tilt of the Earth We have built a model of the seasons which agrees with our observations, but there is one important loose end; we accepted the tilt of the Earth as 23. 5. The next activity will allow us to measure this value! The final activity summarizes and demonstrates our model for the class.Activity 2-10: Measuring the Earth's TiltThis activity is suitable for grades 3 through 6. While the effects of the tilted Earth model are consistent with observation, might it not be possible to measure the Earth's tilt directly? Using observations with a simple shadow stick, we can measure the Sun's angular height in the sky over the course of weeks and months. As we've seen, it is the tilt of the Earth's axis which causes the height of the Sun's path to change. In this activity, we will measure this change to infer the amount of the Earth's tilt. shows that as the height of the Sun changes, it casts different length shadows at midday. By recording these midday shadow lengths and the height of the shadow stick, we can "reconstruct" the situations from these days and measure the angular height directly. The difference of the angular heights of the Sun between an equinox (September 21 or March 21) and a solstice (December 21 or June 21) is equal to the tilt of the Earth's axis, 23. 5.Materials: Shadow stick from Chapter 1; observations of the midday shadow lengths; large sheet of paper; colored markers; protractor. *  1. Obtain midday shadow lengths for convenient equinoxes or solstices (September 21, December 21, March 21, June 21) as described in the activity "Sun Shadows" of the previous chapter. Also make sure to keep a record of the height of the shadow stick. *   2. On a large sheet of paper, draw a line the same length as the shadow stick. To reconstruct the angle of the Sun's height for each equinox and solstice in your data, start at the bottom of the shadow stick and draw a line perpendicular to the shadow stick the same length as the midday shadow for each solstice and equinox in your data. Try using different color markers for each day. Your drawing should resemble the figure above. *   3. Have the class measure the angular height of the Sun on the paper with a protractor for each equinox and solstice. The difference of the angular height between subsequent equinoxes and solstices should be about 23. 5. The difference in angular height between the two equinoxes or the two solstices should be twice that, or 47 . Analysis Option Mathematically, since the shadow stick and its shadows form right triangles, the shadow stick height and the shadow lengths are all that is needed to compute the Sun's angular height; it is simply the arctangent of the ratio between the shadow stick height and the shadow length. While such trigonometric functions are certainly beyond the scope of the elementary school classroom, this fact can be used to verify the students' results.Discussion When are the midday shadows the longest? Why? When are they the shortest? Why? What causes the shadow lengths to change? Can you relate your measurements to our model of the seasons?Activity 2-11: Demonstrating the Tilted EarthThis activity is suitable for students in grades 3-6. This activity demonstrates the model of the seasons we have been developing- that of an Earth whose axis of rotation is tilted by 23. 5 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. By aligning the Earth's axis with a stationary point in space (the location of Polaris), it is easy to demonstrate the tilt of the Earth's axis during the course of an orbit about the Sun (i.e. a year).Materials: Globe of the earth; sign to mark North; and masking tape. A student can act the part of the Sun and another student can hold the globe. *  1. Place the Sun student in the middle of the room. Place the Earth student about six feet away. Mark one corner of the room "North". If we could extend this corner much higher, the North Star would be at its top. *   2. Tilt the globe so that the North Pole tilts towards the ceiling at the corner marked North. The student holding the globe must be careful to preserve this alignment. *   3. Walk the Earth around the Sun making sure to keep the North Pole properly aligned. When the North Pole points away from the Sun, this is winter for the Northern Hemisphere. When it points towards the Sun, it is summer for the Northern Hemisphere. *   4. Walk the Earth around the Sun again, and watch the changes in the Southern Hemisphere. When it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, what is it in the Northern? *   5. After all of the students understand this example, try this experiment with the Earth turned such that its axis is perpendicular to the plane of its orbit about the Sun. If the Earth had this orientation, there would be no seasons. Discussion What differences in climates and seasons can you determine from the observations in these experiments? How would seasonal changes appear to you if you were on the equator or at the north or south poles? What is the pattern of sunlight at the equator? At the North Pole? At the South Pole? What were the differences in how the light was hitting the Northern Hemisphere as you carried the globe around the Sun?Summary: The Reasons for the Seasons is actually three activities in one. In Do Shadows Change with the Seasons?, students conduct a controlled investigation to determine the length of the sun's shadow on a fixed object (i.e., flagpole, telephone pole, etc.) over a three-day period (one day in the fall, one in the winter, and one in the spring).  This concrete experience acts as a springboard to the abstract understanding of the positioning of the sun and Earth as it relates to the changing seasons. In How Do Sunrise and Sunset Change with the Seasons?, students plot sunrise and sunset data collected from the first day of fall, winter, and spring in order to analyze seasonal patterns. In What Can a Model of the Earth and Sun Tell Us about the Seasons?, the teacher uses a lamp and globe to reinforce the connection between the Earth's tilt, its revolution, and seasonal change. The  Family Page extends this learning to the community by providing families with challenges to explore at home.   *  Tides occur because of the pull of gravity of the Moon and the Sun on the Earth's oceans. Because the Moon is closer to the Earth, it has the greatest effect on our tides. There are approximately 2 high tides and 2 low tides every 24 hours. *  Spring tides (often called 'king tides' by fishermen) occur at New Moon and Full Moon when the Sun, the Moon and the Earth are in line. This forms extremely high high-tides and extremely low low-tides. *  Neap tides occur at First Quarter and Last Quarter, when the Sun, the Earth and the Moon are at right angles. This forms quite low high-tides and quite high low-tides. *  Eclipses occur when a large shadow travels across the surface of the Earth. *  Umbra - The Umbra is the darker part of the shadow. *  Penumbra - The Penumbra is the lighter part of the shadow. *  Total Eclipse - Observers on the Earth's surface who are shadowed by the darker umbra would see a total eclipse. *  Partial Eclipse - Observers on the Earth's surface who are shadowed by the lighter penumbra would see a partial eclipse. *  Solar Eclipses occur sometimes when the Moon passes between the Sun and the Earth at New Moon.

For the most part our solar system is a counterclockwise system.  Viewed from above, the Earth makes a complete counterclockwise rotation once in each 24-hour period.  This is why the sun "rises" in the east and not in the west.  The Earth revolves counterclockwise around the sun once every 365 1/4 days.  *  Tilt + Revolution.  The Earth's axis is tilted by 23.5 degrees (see example). The north end of the Earth's axis is always pointed toward the North Star as the Earth revolves around the sun.  The Earth's tilt, combined with its revolution around the sun, causes seasonal changes as the sun's strongest rays heat the northern hemisphere, equator, or southern hemisphere during a given season.  *  Solstice vs. Equinox.   Solstice refers to the two times each year when the sun's strongest rays are furthest from the equator.  For the northern hemisphere, summer solstice occurs around June 21st and winter solstice around December 21st.  Equinox refers to the two times each year when the sun's strongest rays are directly hitting the equator.  In the northern hemisphere, spring equinox occurs around March 21st and autumnal equinox around September 21st.  Note:  In the southern hemisphere, the seasons are reversed (i.e., summer solstice occurs around December 21st, etc.)* Misconceptions.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.esse.ou.edu/fund_concepts/Fundamental_Concepts1/Solar_System/Earths_Seasons.htm<TEXT> discussing Earth's seasons, four dates are key:Autumnal Equinox: 22/23 September = beginning of FallWinter Solstice: Dec 21/22 = beginning of WinterVernal Equinox: March 20 = beginning of SpringSummer Solstice: June 21 = beginning of Summer This table expresses a Northern Hemisphere-centric view, for the opposite seasons apply on these dates for the Southern Hemisphere. These dates change slowly over time due to changes in the orientation of Earth's rotation axis. As these changes occur, where the seasons occur along Earth's orbit also changes. The seasons are due to two causes. The primary cause of the seasons is the tilt of Earth's rotation axis. A secondary cause of the seasons is the elliptic shape of Earth's orbit.Equinoxes (The Equinoctal Points) An equinox can be defined in several equivalent ways. One way is to say that it is the moment in time at which the line drawn through the center of the Sun and center of the Earth  is perpendicular to the plane determined by  the ecliptic axis and  the line along the rotation axis of the Earth (which also pass through the center of the Earth). For example, on the Autumnal Equinox, the terminator aligns with a circle of longitude and so passes through both the North and South Poles; every point on Earth's surface enjoys 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of night. The Sun sets at the North Pole, beginning six months of night; it rises at the South Pole to begin six months of daylight. The sub-solar point crosses the equator, moving from the Northern Hemisphere into the Southern Hemisphere. Similar events characterize the Vernal Equinox.Solstices A solstice can be defined in several equivalent ways. One way is to its is the moment in time at which  the line drawn from the center of the Sun to the center of the Earth,  the line drawn through the center of the Earth perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, and  the line along the rotation axis of the Earth  all lie in the same plane.See the sketch illustrating the illumination of the Earth by the Sun at the Winter Solstice.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.astronomynotes.com/nakedeye/s10.htm<TEXT>The seasonal temperature depends on the amount of heat received from the Sun in a given time. To hold the temperature constant, there must be a balance between the amount of heat gained and the amount radiated to space. If more heat is received than is lost, your location gets warmer; if more heat is lost gained, your location gets cooler. What causes the amount of energy reaching a given location during the day to change throughout the year? Two popular theories are often stated to explain the temperature differences of the seasons: 1) the different distances the Earth is from the Sun in its elliptical orbit (at perihelion the Earth is 147.1 million kilometers from the Sun and at aphelion the Earth is 152.1 million kilometers from the Sun); and 2) the tilt of the Earth's axis with respect to its orbital plane. If the first theory were true, then both the north and south hemispheres should experience the same seasons at the same time. They do not. Using the scientific method discussed in chapters 1 and 2, you can reject the distance theory. A popular variation of the distance theory says that the part of the Earth tilted toward the Sun should be hotter than the part tilted away from the Sun because of the differences in distances. If you continue along with this line of reasoning, then you conclude that the night side of the Earth is colder than the daylight side because the night side is farther away from the Sun. This ignores the more straightforward reason that the night side is directed opposite the Sun, so the Sun's energy does not directly reach it. But let's examine the tilt-distance model a little more. The 23.5  tilt of the Earth means that the north pole is about 5080 kilometers closer than the south pole toward the end of June. This is much, much smaller than the 152 million kilometer distance between the Sun and the Earth's center at that time. The amount of energy received decreases with the square of the distance. If you calculate (152,000,000 + 5080)2/(152,000,000 - 5080)2, you will find that the north pole would get slightly over 1/100th of one percent more energy than the south pole. This is much too small a difference to explain the large temperature differences! Even if you compare one side of the Earth with the opposite side, so you use the Earth's diameter in place of the 5080 kilometers in the calculation above, you get 3/100th of one  percent difference in energy received. Clearly, distance is not the reason for the large temperature differences. Notice that I used the aphelion value for the distance between the Earth and Sun. That is because the Earth is near aphelion during the northern hemisphere's summer! This is known by measuring the apparent size of the Sun. You can safely assume that the Sun's actual size does not vary with a period that depends on the orbital period of a planet thousands of times smaller than it, or that it would choose the Earth's orbital period as its pulsation cycle. Even though the distance model (in any variation) is incorrect, it is still a "good" scientific theory in that it makes testable predictions of how the temperature should change throughout the year and by how much. However, what annoys scientists, particularly astronomy professors, is ignoring those predictions and the big conflicts between predictions and what is observed. Let's take a look at a model that correctly predicts what is observed.  The tilt theory correctly explains the seasons but the reason is a little more subtle than the distance theory's explanation. Because the Earth's rotation axis is tilted, the north hemisphere will be pointed toward the Sun and will experience summer while the south hemisphere will be pointed away from the Sun and will experience winter. During the summer the sunlight strikes the ground more directly (closer to perpendicular), concentrating the Sun's energy. This concentrated energy is able to heat the surface more quickly than during the winter time when the Sun's rays hit the ground at more glancing angles, spreading out the energy.  Also, during the summer the Sun is above the horizon for a longer time so its energy has more time to heat things up than during the winter.  The rotational axes of most of the other planets of the solar system are also tilted with respect to their orbital planes so they undergo seasonal changes in their temperatures too. The planets Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus have very small tilts (3  or less) so the varying distance they are from the Sun may play more of a role in any seasonal temperature variations. However, of these three, only Mercury has significant differences between perihelion and aphelion. Its extremely thin atmosphere is not able to retain any of the Sun's energy. Jupiter's and Venus' orbits are very nearly circular and their atmospheres are very thick, so their temperature variations are near zero. Mars, Saturn, and Neptune have tilts that are similar to the Earth's, but Saturn and Neptune have near zero temperature variation because of their very thick atmospheres and nearly circular orbits. Mars has large temperature changes because of its very thin atmosphere and its more eccentric orbit places its southern hemisphere closest to the Sun during its summer and farthest from the Sun during its winter. Mars' northern hemisphere has milder seasonal variation than its southern hemisphere because of this arrangement. Since planets move slowest in their orbits when they are furthest from the Sun, Mars' southern hemisphere has short, hot summers and long, cold winters. Uranus' seasons should be the most unusual because it orbits the Sun on its side---its axis is tilted by 98 degrees! For half of the Uranian year, one hemisphere is in sunlight and the other is in the dark. For the other half of the Uranian year, the situation is reversed. The thick atmosphere of Uranus distributes the solar energy from one hemisphere to the other effectively, so the seasonal temperature changes are near zero. Pluto's axis is also tilted by a large amount (122.5 degrees), its orbit is the most elliptical of the planets, and it has an extremely thin atmosphere. But it is always so far from the Sun that it is perpetually in deep freeze (only 50 degrees above absolute zero!).</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://earth.usc.edu/classes/geol150/stott/variability/orbitalchanges.html<TEXT>Obliquity refers to the tilt of the Earth's axis. Over time, the angle of Earth's tilt varies between 22.2 and 24.5 degrees (currently the tilt is 23.5 and decreasing). These variations, discovered by French astronomer Urbain Leverrier in the 1840s, are caused by the gravitational pull of large planets, including Jupiter. Earth's obliquity varies cyclically with a period of 41,000 years. See the  obliquity cycle animated! The tilt is exaggerated by about 10x in this animation. However, the phasing is accurate.What is the effect of variations in obliquity? Changes in obliquity amplify or suppress the seasons. A larger tilt means that the summer hemisphere will receive more solar radiation, while the winter hemisphere will receive less.    Eccentricity The Earth's orbit around the Sun is described by its eccentricity. Eccentricity is expressed mathematically as: e = (a2 - b2)1/2  / awhere a and b are the major and minor axes of the ellipse, respectively. What is the eccentricity of a circular orbit? Earth's eccentricity has varied over time between values of 0.005 and 0.0607 (currently the eccentricity is 0.0167). Eccentricity has a period of about 100,000 years (see below).    Changes in insolation due to the eccentricity cycle are very slight, at most 0.2%. Eccentricity is important because it modulates the amplitude of the precession cycle (see below). See the  eccentricity cycle animated! The eccentricity is exaggerated. Without this exaggeration, the changes would be nearly imperceptible.Precession of the equinoxes The position of the solstices and equinoxes are not fixed. Instead, they shift with respect to Earth's eccentric orbit and with respect to aphelion (point in Earth's orbit farthest from Sun) and perihelion (point in Earth's orbit closest to the Sun). The best way to imagine the axial precession is to think of the Earth as a spinning top. As a spinning top slows, it begins to wobble. Similarly, the Earth has a slow wobbling motion, called the  axial precession. This wobbling motion does not affect the tilt angle of the Earth, but the direction in which the Earth is tilting (see the diagram above). The axial precession is caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon on the Earth's equatorial bulge. The axial precession causes the solstices and equinoxes to move around Earth's orbit, completing a full orbit around the Sun every 25,700.A second motion also affects the position of the equinoxes and solstices and is known as the precession of the ellipse. This motion describes the rotation of the Earth's elliptical orbit (see below). This motion is even slower than the wobbling motion of the axial precession.        The combined effect of the axial precession and precession of the ellipse is referred to as the precessional cycle with a cyclicity of 3,000 and 19,000 years (for an average of 21,700 years).  See the precessional cycle animated! This animation demonstrates the changing winter time position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun.  The complete effect of the precession on solar radiation must take into account both the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit and the precession. Compare the unmodulated (above) and modulated (below) precessional cycles.      What is the effect of the precessional cycle? The precession cycle modifies where the equinoxes and solstices occur in the Earth's, influencing the seasonal cycle. Currently, the Earth's axis points toward Polaris. In 12,000 years, the axis will be tilted toward Vega, and the orbital positions at which winter and summer solstices occur will be reversed. Consequently, the Northern hemisphere will experience winter near aphelion and summer will occur near perihelion. Thus, seasonal contrasts will be greater than they are today. Insolation changes on Earth The diagram below shows the long-term June and December insolation variations. Changes in low- and middle-latitude insolation are the result of precession. Solar insolation changes at high middle-latitudes are due predominantly to the obliquity cycle.Also note that the phasing of the insolation maxima and minima differ for the obliquity and precession cycles. The tilt causes in-phase changes in insolation. If the tilt increases, both hemispheres receives more insolation during summer and less during winter (see the top panel below). In contrast, precession causes out-of-phase changes in insolation. When the Northern Hemisphere summer solstice is at aphelion (as it is now), the summer insolation is at a minima. On the other hand, the Southern Hemisphere summer solstice is at perihelion and summer insolation is at a maxima (see the bottom panel).   Orbital Monsoon Hypothesis Idea proposed by John Kutzbach that changing insolation could influence strength of monsoons. How does this work? Remember that the monsoons are driven by differential heating of land and water. In the case of the summer monsoon, strong summer radiation creates very low pressure over land. High pressure forms over the ocean, because it does not warm as rapidly as land. Consequently, moisture-laden winds flow onto the continent. The winter monsoon is just the opposite. High pressure forms over land due to weaker winter radiation. Low pressure develops over the ocean. And, dry winds flow from the continent to the ocean. Changing seasonal insolation will change the strength of the monsoons. Stronger summer radiation will strengthen the summer monsoon. Weaker winter radiation will strengthen the winter monsoon. It turns out that the African monsoon is very sensitive to insolation variations. Which of the orbital cycles will most strongly affect the African monsoon? The precession cycle or the obliquity cycle?    Figure. Relationship between summer radiation and African monsoon (from Earth's Climate Past and Future by W.F. Ruddiman).The African monsoon is responsible for precipitation over northern Africa. Today, the summer solstice occurs at aphelion. So, the summer insolation is near its minimum. As a consequence, northern Africa is very dry. About 10,000 years ago, the summer insolation was 8% higher than today. During this time, lakes existed across northern Africa. Although the strength of the winter monsoon also varies, it has less of an impact on the African environment because the winter monsoon has little affect on precipitation over Africa. Evidence of orbitally-controlled African summer monsoon:  1. Lake levels across North Africa  2. Mediterranean circulation and deposition of marine sediments  3. Freshwater diatoms (small plant plankton) in the tropical Atlantic  4.

He showed that the cumulative effects of several cyclical changes in the Earth's orbital properties could cause climatic cycles, but it was not until the 1970's that a sufficiently long and detailed chronology of Pleistocene temperature changes was constructed to test the theory adequately. A correspondence between astronomical cycles and late Cenozoic climate fluctuations was clearly apparent. These cycles are now known as Milankovitch cycles.There are three characteristics of the Earth's orbit and rotation that control the cyclicality: 1.   Eccentricity Eccentricity is the departure form circularity of the Earth's  orbit. The Earth's orbit is an ellipse with the sun at one focus.  The shape of the ellipse varies from almost circular (low  eccentricity) to more elliptical (high eccentricity). The higher  the eccentricity, the greater is the seasonal variation in  radiation received at any point on the Earth's surface. These  changes occur in a cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years.  Present eccentricity is very low. 2.   Tilt Tilt is the inclination of the Earth's axis, which varies  between 22  and 24.8 . Increasing tilt increases the  difference in the seasonal amount of solar radiation received for  each hemisphere. The present inclination of 23.5  is close to  the overall average. Tilt varies in cycles of 41,000  years. 3.   Precession Precession is the wobble of the Earth's axis. The Earth wobbles  on its axis like a spinning top, in an anticlockwise direction,  when viewed from above the north pole. One revolution takes 26,000  years. At the same time, the axis of Earth's elliptical orbit is  also rotating, but in the opposite direction and much more slowly.  The two motions together cause a progressive shift in the position  of the spring and autumn equinoxes and the summer and winter  solstices. The equinoxes move around the orbital path every 23,000  years. This is known as the precession of the equinoxes.These changes in eccentricity, tilt and precession cause variations of up to 10% in the amount of radiant energy that reaches any particular place on the Earth's surface in a given season. The main effect is to change the contrast between seasons, not the amount of solar heat reaching the Earth. These cycles within cycles predict that during glacial advances, winter temperatures are milder but so too are summer temperatures, leading to less ice melting during summer than is accumulated in winter, so glaciers advance.Studies of fossils in deep sea cores indicate that climatic fluctuations in the last hundred thousand years is remarkably similar to that predicted by the Milankovitch cycles. However, as astronomical cycles have been regular and cyclical for billions of years, if it were the only or dominant factor in climate change, we would expect glaciation to have been a regular event over geological time, rather than a rare, sporadic occurrence. Other factors must be involved.Continental DistributionsAs well as the movement of continents from one latitude and climate zone to another affecting local climates, the distribution of land and water masses and the growth of high mountain chains can affect Earth's overall climate. Mountain ranges influence air circulation and the distribution of moisture, ocean circulation patterns distribute warm and cool masses over the planet and polar ice sheets affects the planetary albedo.In the present configuration of the continents, the critical time and region for receiving solar radiation is summer around latitude 60 N. At this latitude (passing through Canada, southern Alaska and Siberia) winter snow falls on the land need to be melted in summer. If this is not achieved, the ice builds up and continental glaciers start advancing. Advance of continental glaciers increase the earth's albedo - the percentage of radiation reflected back into space, which accentuates the cooling process. When the eccentricity, tilt and precession of earth's orbit conspire to produce less solar radiation reaching the 60 N latitude in summer, the earth enters a period of glaciation. Over the past 150,000 years there has been a close correlation between summer radiation at 60 N and global climate. The distribution of annual radiation in the southern hemisphere is less important, as around the 60 S latitude it is entirely ocean, so continental glaciation can not advance.Ocean currents are also affected by the distribution of the continents. At present, earth's climate is tempered by a "conveyor belt" of ocean currents. Warm surface currents, such as the Gulf Stream, move north in the Atlantic, evaporating and cooling as they go. By the time they get to the North Atlantic, they are cold and salty and are therefore denser and start to sink. This cold, salty water forms a bottom current that flows south. The net effect is to moderate global climate as heat is transferred from the tropics to high latitudes. When the ocean currents are altered, for example, by cooling climates leading to less evaporation, the climate will deteriorate sharply.In the Middle Cretaceous, for example, low-lying continents were grouped together in the middle of a great expanse of ocean, helping to create a warm, tropical climate. Average global temperatures were at least 6 C higher than today, and possibly up to 14 C higher. The difference between equatorial and polar temperatures in the Middle Cretaceous was only around 17 C - 26 C, compared with 41 C today. Climate modeling simulations show that the arrangement of the continents and oceans could account for nearly 5 C of warming.Greenhouse GasesGreenhouse gases in the atmosphere allow short wavelength solar radiation to pass through the atmosphere, but absorb longer wavelength infrared radiation (heat). Water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas, but minor phases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) also provide significant warming.Large seabed methane deposits have been found off the coast of Canada, and recent evidence has shown that massive increases in methane levels accompanied the rapid rise in temperature at the end of the Eocene (see New Scientist article)Geochemical reconstructions of atmospheric levels over the past 100 Ma point to at least a tenfold increase in CO2 during the Middle Cretaceous. This would be enough to raise average global temperatures by as much as 8 C.Volcanic ActivityDuring major volcanic eruptions, dust and gases are emitted. The gases react with atmospheric water vapor to form aerosols of fine particles carried in suspension. An important component of volcanic emissions is sulfur dioxide (SO2), which combines with water vapor to produce droplets of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Dust settles out of the atmosphere relatively quickly, but sulfuric acid remains in the atmosphere for several years. The dust and sulfuric acid have the effect of reflecting sunlight back out into space, lowering global temperature. Locally, acid rain may also fall. Volcanoes with alkaline magma compositions have also been known to generate rain with a high concentration of NaCl (salt), which can be devastating to vegetation.Igneous activity constitutes a major natural source of CO2 entering the atmosphere. Most of this is generated by slow, non-eruptive degassing from magmas in the upper crust. In the Middle Cretaceous, however, rates of continental drift were about three times as great as they are now, implying increased extrusion rates at spreading centers. It was also a time of vast outpourings of submarine basalts, forming oceanic plateaus. The largest of these is the Ontong-Java Plateau, north-east of the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides. It is a region of oceanic crust that is two-thirds the size of Australia and is 25 km to 43 km thick - five times the thickness of normal oceanic crust. It is dated at about 120 Ma and was probably created in less than 3 Ma. This one eruption produced between 15 and 20 km3 of lava each year, which is comparable to the amount of new crust formed today by the entire oceanic ridge system. The eruptions could have raised CO2 levels to between 8 to 12 times that of the pre industrial level, with one estimate being up to 20 times that of A.D. 1760. This would be sufficient to raise global temperatures by as much as 10 C.Such flood basalts are believed to be generated at the core-mantle boundary. Heating by the core of the overlying mantle creates a mantle plume that migrates through the mantle, due to its lower density. As it nears the surface, decompression melting produces basaltic magma, which breaks through to the surface. Thus, the atmospheric warming of the Middle Cretaceous was a direct response to the cooling of the Earth's core.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.exploratorium.edu/chaco/HTML/tg-seasons.doc <TEXT>Making a Model of the EarthPush the straw through the center of the Styrofoam ball. This represents the axis about which the earth rotates. One end is north and the other end is south. Place a rubber band around the center of the ball (the earth's equator). Looking at a globe or a map, find your approximate latitude, and place the tack or dot there. (For example, San Francisco is at 37.75 north, so placing the tack not quite halfway between the equator and the North Pole is an acceptable approximation.) Use the scissors to make a hole in the bottom of the plastic cup, near the side, as shown above. It should be just large enough to accommodate the diameter of the straw.Take an 8-cm piece of tape and stick a 2-cm piece to the center of the 8-cm piece (sticky sides together). Place the straw into the hole in the cup, and use the modified tape to hold the straw against the side of the cup, yet still allowing the straw to rotate in the hole. Your model should look something like the picture on the left. Use a protractor to check the angle of the earth's tilt. It should be 23.5 degrees. Setting up the RoomUse one bright lamp for the whole group or flashlights for small groups. Designate some visual reference as Polaris, the North Star. All straws should point to Polaris throughout the activity.Set up the light in the center of the group or flashlights in the center of each small group. Before darkening the room, make sure all earth models are oriented correctly toward polaris. Darken the room.To Do and Notice: Model a Day on EarthEach student should turn the straw so that the earth spins counterclockwise (when viewed from the north) for one rotation. They should notice that the dot is in light (day) for about half of the rotation and is in shadow (night) for about half of the rotation.Modeling the SeasonsDivide the class into four groups. Have each group move to one of the four seasonal positions around the lamp (or one student at each position around a flashlight if using small groups): December 21, March 21, June 21, and September 21. It should look like this if seen from above: Have each group model a day at each position. At each position, they should notice:* For what fraction of the day is the dot in the light? More than half? Less than half? About half?* For what fraction of the day is the North Pole in the light?* How is the light from the sun striking the dot? Is it direct or at an angle? For example, on December 21:Angle at or above equator, direct below equator Modeling a YearAfter students have been to each of the four dates: December 21, March 21, June 21, and September 21, they'll have modeled a year: one earth revolution around the sun. What's Going On?Many people think the seasons are caused by variations in our distance from the sun. While the earth's orbit is slightly elliptical, it's very close to circular, and the variation in distance between the earth and sun is not enough to account for our seasons. The seasons are caused by the tilt of the earth. The earth holds its rotation axis (tilt) fixed in space as it moves around the sun. In the summer, the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the sun. It's warmer because (1) there are more hours of daylight, providing us with more heat energy, and (2) the midday sun shines more directly head on, increasing the amount of solar energy the earth receives. In the winter, when the Northern Hemisphere tilts away from the sun, the sun's rays strike the earth at a lower angle, and the energy from the sunlight is spread out over a larger area, which reduces its effectiveness at heating the ground. Combined with shorter daylight hours, the temperatures are cooler in winter. The seasons in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are opposite. * The sun dagger petroglyph (see link below) was a way for the Chacoans to know when the seasons were changing. Why would this be important for them?Going Further* Revisit the year stations. Notice the angle at which the sun strikes your dot during the summer versus during the winter. In which season are you the most likely to get sunburned? Why? * Imagine you're living on the equator. How would you describe the change of seasons?* Now imagine that you're at the North Pole in the summer. What path does the sun take across the sky?Check for Understanding* What special aspect of the sun's position or movement do we mark with the solstices and the equinoxes?* What would seasons on the earth be like if the axis weren't tilted?</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2008/07/04/does-the-sun-look-smaller-to-you/<TEXT>Does the Sun look smaller to you?Criminy, I almost forgot: today, July 4th, at roughly 08:00 UT, the Earth was at aphelion.Uh, what? I hear you ask. OK, brief astronomy lesson for you, then back to the grill!The Earth does not orbit the Sun in a perfect circle. The orbit is slightly elliptical. If you were to draw the Earth's orbit on a piece of paper, you'd need a sharp eye to detect its non-circularity, but deviant it is. What this means in real terms is that the Earth ranges from about 148 to about 152 million kilometers from the Sun over the course of six months (which is how long it takes to get from one side of the orbit to the other, of course).When the Earth is closest to the Sun it's at perihelion, and when it's farthest it's called aphelion (I usually pronounce that app-helion, if you care, though I've heard others say aff-helion). So today we passed aphelion, and slowly but inexorably, over the next six months we'll draw slightly closer to the Sun, and then the whole thing repeats.That 4 million km difference sounds like a lot. But over the 150 million average radius of the orbit it's only a slight difference by eye. The Sun will look about 3% larger at perihelion versus aphelion, and you'd never notice that, especially since the change is slow and takes six months. The amount of sunlight hitting the Earth does increase at perihelion, being about 5% greater than at aphelion. That's quite a bit! But the effect isn't as bad as you'd think. Why not?For us northern hemisphere folks, we are farthest from the Sun in summer, and closest in winter, so that mitigates the temperature extreme. On average, winters are a bit warmer and summers a bit cooler. But wait! In the southern hemisphere, the seasons are reversed! So they should have extra hot summers and extra cold winters.But they don't. Why not Because the southern hemisphere is mostly water. Go ahead, find a globe and take a look; it's incredible how much of that half the Earth is water bound. Water absorbs and releases heat slowly, so all summer the oceans suck down that extra solar energy, and release it all winter. That helps balance out the temperature extremes.Oh, one more thing: the Earth precesses, that is, the axis of rotation moves like a wobbling top. It takes a long time for the wobble to make one cycle, well over 20,000 years. But this changes the timing of the seasons compared to the orbit. In a few millennia, we'll have perihelion at the same time as northern summer, and aphelion at northern winter. It's hard to say what effect this will have on the environment, since it brings extra-hot summers and extra-cold winters. However, the last time this happened was around the same time the Sahara forest went away and was replaced by, well, guess.But for today, don't fret too much about wandering poles and aphelion except to say, if you're out sweltering in the Sun today celebrating the holiday in the U.S., you might want to take just a moment and be glad our orbit isn't more elliptical, or that it isn't 15,000 AD.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/badpole.html<TEXT>Polaris, the North star, is a very bright star.Bad Astronomy: The North Star, Polaris, is a very bright star.Good Astronomy: Polaris is a middling-bright star, easily missed. And it won't even be the North Star forever!The other day a friend was asking me about an object he saw in the sky, and as he described it I got confused. He said it was close to Polaris, the North Star, but he also said it was in the East. "It can't be in the East if it was near Polaris," I told him. "But it was near this really bright star!" he replied. It was then I knew I was onto more Bad Astronomy.A lot of people think that Polaris is a very bright, if not the brightest star in the sky. It isn't. As a matter of fact, it's only about average. From my own back yard I have a hard time seeing it! (I live a few miles north of Washington, DC, and the sky is bright from city lights).It's natural, I suppose, to think that such an important star should be bright, but really, that's a conceit, like thinking that the Earth is at the center of the Universe. If more people knew just why Polaris is the North Star, this Bad Idea would stop.The Earth is spinning on its axis like a top, once a day. We define the points where this axis intersects the Earth's surface as the North and South Poles. If you stood at the North Pole (brrrr!) over the course of one day you would spin around once. Now, since we are stuck on the surface of the Earth, we don't really perceive this spin. We do see the sky, however, and our spin makes it look like the sky is revolving around us once a day.Imagine someone standing on the equator. If he looks straight up, he will see stars fly past him all night long as the Earth spins, sweeping him around the circumference of the Earth. The stars would appear to rise in the East and set in the West. However, if he were at the North Pole, it would look like the stars are spinning around a point straight up in the sky. This point is called the North Celestial Pole (NCP), and is basically the same as the North Pole on the Earth projected up into the sky. All the stars seem to spin around this point, just as the Earth spins around its own North Pole.So we can see that this point on the sky is only special to us on the surface of the Earth. A different planet, with an axis pointing in a different direction, would see a different spot on the sky as its NCP. It just so happens we see a star near this spot. This star is part of the Little Dipper (as it's called in the U.S.), and is about 2nd magnitude, which means it ain't all that bright. It is the brightest star in the Little Dipper, but that isn't saying much since the Little Dipper is a much fainter counterpart of its bigger brother, the Big Dipper.The reason Polaris is important is because it is so close to the NCP. As the night progresses, Polaris does not rise or set, but seems to be glued to the sky! So at any time in the night you can find Polaris, and it is always in the North. If you get lost, you can always figure out your direction by finding Polaris (provided that you are in the Earth's northern hemisphere!).Now remember, there is a South Celestial Pole as well. It lies in the constellation called Octans, and the nearest star to it is a a very faint 5th magnitude star, which is near the limit of the human eye to see unaided. More proof of our Polaris conceit!Note that stars near the two celestial poles will make little circles around the pole as the Earth spins. The farther you get from the poles, the bigger the circle. At some point, the circle will be big enough so that it just touches your horizon. Stars inside that circle are said to be circumpolar, and they never set! They just seem to circle the pole endlessly. Note that the stars you see as circumpolar depend on your latitude. If you were at the North Pole, all the stars you can see in the sky are circumpolar, but at the equator, no stars are! At the equator, both celestial poles lie on the horizon, and all the stars in the sky rise and set.One more thing: have you ever watched a top spin, and seen it wobble? The wobble is due to a force called torque, which is like a twisting pull. When torque is applied to a spinning object, the spin axis will precess, or make a little circle as the top spins. Well, the same thing is happening to the Earth! The gravity of the Moon and Sun provides a torque on the Earth, causing the axis to wobble. The Earth's axis takes 26,000 years to make a complete circle, and as it moves it points to different parts of the sky. It just so happens that right now it is pointing near Polaris (actually, Polaris is about a degree away from the actual North Celestial Pole). In a few thousand years, the Earth's pole will be pointed at the bright star Vega, which is one of the ten brightest stars in the sky. Imagine how hard it will be to convince people that's just a coincidence when that happens!Bad Reader Andrew Sincinito brought to my attention the lyrics of a song by Gerry Rafferty, called "Right Down the Line":  I know how much I lean on you  Only you can see  The changes that I've been through  Have left a mark on me  You've been as constant as a northern star  The brightest light that shines  It's been you  Woman  Right down the lineI hate to give him more credit than he might deserve, but those lines could be interpreted as "she is as constant as the north star, and she is the brightest light that shines;" he might not have been talking about Polaris. However, he might have meant that Polaris is the brightest star in the sky. If so, we have another victim of Bad Astronomy. If not, well, the lyrics are still kind of Bad. ;-)Incidentally, Mark Bellis of Canada tells me that Joni Mitchell had an even earlier song with similar lyrics in it. I guess this idea goes back pretty far. Matter of fact, Shakespeare made the same error in "Julius Caesar"! So I guess Joni and Gerry are in good company.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://search.eb.com.turing.library.northwestern.edu/eb/print?articleId=439155&fullArticle=true&tocId=9439155<TEXT>In 2007 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released its Fourth Assessment Report. Previous assessments (1990, 1995, 2001) had provided strong indications that by various measures the Earth's climate was becoming warmer, but with the latest report the picture had become clearer: Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level.The IPCC was established in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization (a UN agency) in recognition of the potential importance of climate change. The IPCC is charged with reviewing comprehensive scientific climate-change studies and providing an objective understanding of climate change, its potential impacts, and options for adaptation and mitigation. Hundreds of climatologists, meteorologists, and other scientists from around the world are involved in the preparation of IPCC reports as authors, contributors, and expert reviewers. The fourth assessment was compiled by three IPCC working groups, and an overview of their findings is provided in the sections that follow.Climate undergoes natural changes and cycles. In order to understand the Earth's overall warming, therefore, scientists examine the balance of the energy that reaches the Earth from the Sun and the energy that is radiated away from the Earth. They then identify radiative forcings that is, human or natural factors that drive the energy balance up or down. The fourth assessment established that anthropogenic (human) activity is responsible for most of the current global warming, with radiative forcing from anthropogenic sources being over 10 times larger than all natural components combined. The primary anthropogenic source is the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, which is produced mainly by the burning of fossil fuels. (Greenhouse gases are gases that allow sunlight to pass through but trap heat radiated from the Earth as it is warmed by the sunlight.) Land-use change, such as the burning or clearing of forests, provides a lesser contribution.Effects on the Physical WorldThe Fourth Assessment Report documented that 11 of the past 12 years have been the warmest on record since 1850 (when global instrumental record keeping began). Over the past 100 years, the global annual average surface temperature has risen by 0.74 C (1.3 F), with most of this warming coming in only the past 50 years. The world has not been warming uniformly as climate changes, however. In general, average land surface temperatures have been increasing more rapidly than ocean surface temperatures (although the oceans absorb 80% of the heat that the world is gaining). The Arctic has been the region with the most rapid rate of warming two to three times the global average. In contrast, surface temperatures of Antarctica have not risen significantly. (For Projected Surface Temperature Changes, see Map.)With warmer surface temperatures and warmer oceans, more water evaporates and the moisture in the atmosphere increases. Storms with heavy precipitation have occurred with more frequency and intensity. Extreme events such as hurricanes and cyclones are not more frequent globally, but there is evidence of an increase in the strength and duration of the storms since 1970 that is consistent with increases in ocean temperature. Increases in the extent of spring melting and in storms with heavy precipitation have resulted in more flooding in some areas. Warmer temperatures can also mean more rapid drying, however, and some areas have experienced more periods marked by drought.With the advent of satellite imagery in the late 1970s, it became possible to monitor snow and ice coverage on a global scale. Snow pack, sea ice, and glaciers have been melting, and the rate of melt has been increasing in recent decades. Permafrost (ground that normally stays frozen year-round) in the Northern Hemisphere is also beginning to melt, and the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica are losing mass. The most visible expression of climate change has been the seasonal retreat of Arctic sea ice. The summertime sea-ice minimum in the Arctic has shown a declining trend, and in 2007 the minimum was 23% less than the record minimum that was set in 2005. (See Map.)The melting of land-based ice and the expansion of the oceans as they have become warmer account about equally for observed increases in sea level. (Melting of sea ice does not raise sea level, since floating ice already displaces its equivalent in melt water.) Sea level has risen by 17 cm (7 in) in the past 100 years. Although this is a relatively small amount, historical data indicate that mean sea level had been virtually unchanged for the previous 2,000 years.Effects on Biological SystemsAs temperatures rise and precipitation and storm patterns shift, there have been accompanying changes in the biological world. The fourth assessment states: Observational evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases. Some land plant and animal species have shifted their ranges poleward (northward in the Northern Hemisphere and southward in the Southern Hemisphere), and some have moved upslope to higher elevations, where it is cooler. Boreal forests, for example, have been observed encroaching northward on the Arctic tundra at a rate of 12 km (7.5 mi) per year.In general, mid- to high-latitude regions have had earlier springs and a longer growing season. Other changes that have been reported include earlier leaf production in trees, earlier egg hatching in birds, and an earlier awakening from hibernation by mammals. The timing varies for different species, however, depending on their specific behavior and ability to adapt to change.As climate and some ecosystems have shifted, there has been some loss and fragmentation of terrestrial habitats. Climate change is thought to play a role in the population decrease and ultimately the extinction of some species by such mechanisms as constricting habitat, affecting reproductive patterns, and providing an advantage to competing species. Particularly at risk are species that have a restricted range and low adaptive capacity.Some marine and freshwater biological ecosystems have also shifted poleward, apparently because of rising water temperatures, loss of ice cover, and changes in ocean circulation and water chemistry. Examples of affected organisms include algae, plankton, and fish in high-latitude regions and in high-altitude lakes. Warming of the southern oceans has been associated with a decline in the population of krill (a small crustacean of the open sea), which in turn has been linked to a decrease in seabird and seal populations in the region. Loss of habitat is also expected to affect those species that are dependent on Arctic sea ice, such as the polar bear, walrus, and several species of seals and seabirds. Overall biological abundance in the oceans is difficult to determine, but satellite imagery of chlorophyll levels (from marine plant life) indicates that primary ocean production has gone down 6% globally since the early 1980s.Another potential impact on marine life is related to the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere because some of the gas is absorbed by the oceans. The extra dissolved carbon dioxide in seawater has made it more acidic (measured as an average decrease in pH). There is evidence that the acidity may be exacerbating the coral bleaching already caused by ocean warming.Effects on Human SocietyThe effects of climate change are beginning to appear in the human sphere, although in general they are not as evident as the impacts on the natural world. Problems related to water supply are projected to increase in many regions as the result of shrinking glaciers and snowpack, drought, evaporation, and the infiltration of salt water in low-lying areas through rising sea levels. Lack of access to usable water is a key vulnerability, especially in less-developed countries (LDCs).Climate change is expected to have a mixed impact on agriculture. With spring occurring sooner in mid- to high-latitude regions, a longer growing season would benefit crop yields. Agricultural productivity, however, is vulnerable to other potential consequences of climate change, such as heat waves, floods, and droughts. Agricultural production in low-latitude regions has already been adversely affected by global warming. The Sahel region of Africa has seen crop failures because of intense and more frequent droughts. The situation has resulted in famines and has been exacerbated by other stresses in the region. Unfortunately, crop yields are expected to continue to drop in coming decades as a result of climate change.Like agriculture, forestry is expected to be positively and negatively affected. Forests of the Northern Hemisphere would benefit from an extended growing season but might also experience adverse effects from other factors. For example, forests from British Columbia to Alaska have been subjected to severe infestations of tree-killing beetles that have proliferated with a warmer regime. Dead trees in turn increase the risk of wildfires.Coastal cities and infrastructure, especially low-lying delta regions and small islands, are vulnerable to sea storms. A rise in sea level together with more intense, or extreme, weather could combine to create severe damage. The costs associated with such damage are not necessarily incremental, because its severity could suddenly become much greater when structures are subjected to forces that exceed what they have been designed to withstand.Climate change might have adverse effects on human health. There is evidence that the ranges of mosquitoes and other disease vectors have increased, although there is no clear indication of any corresponding increase in the incidence of the diseases they transmit. Cold-related injury and deaths are projected to decrease, but heat-related increases would outweigh them. Heat waves can be very serious, as shown by the 2003 heat wave in Europe, in which 35,000 excess deaths were recorded. Increased stress on water and food resources would result in a higher incidence of malnutrition. The hardest hit areas are likely to be those with low capacity for adaptation in other words, regions that do not have spare economic resources and that are subject to various kinds of stress in addition to any created by climate change.Responses to Climate ChangeIn order to project future climate change, the IPCC employs computer-based climate models, which over several decades of development have consistently provided a robust and unambiguous picture of significant climate warming in response to increasing greenhouse gases. The greatest uncertainties in the climate models lie in predictions of human behavior (for example, predictions concerning economic and population growth) that affect greenhouse-gas emissions and their cumulative concentration. For this reason the IPCC used several different emissions scenarios, based on different assumptions concerning global and regional development. For the six major emissions scenarios, the range of the projected rise in global average annual temperature was 1.8 to 4 C (3.2 to 7.2 F) over the next century if no measures are taken to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Despite these uncertainties, all of the models predict that the currently observed changes to the physical world brought on by global warming will continue and will accelerate over the coming decades.Some climate-change impacts present opportunities, while others pose risks, but climate change in general is projected to be disruptive, with an overall negative impact on both society and the environment. Although regional and local uncertainties about the effects of climate change remain, the general trends are now fairly well understood. The largest unknown is how people and governments will respond to the situation.People and other living beings have experience adapting to change. Human adaptation can be achieved through a variety of means, such as technology, management, modification of behavior, or social policy. Adaptation is a way of addressing the immediate consequences of climate change, and some adaptation is already taking place on an ad hoc basis. According to the fourth assessment, however, more extensive adaptation than is currently occurring is required to reduce vulnerability to climate change. There are barriers, limits and costs, which are not fully understood. Climate change is projected to bring severe stress on the capability of supplying such necessities as water, food, and health care. In accepting the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the IPCC, the organization's chairman R.K. Pachauri stated that climate change raised the threat of dramatic population migration, conflict, and war over water and other resources as well as a realignment of power among nations.Human greenhouse-gas emissions essentially began with the industrial era two centuries ago. Emissions increased with the growth of industrialization that followed World War II, and they increased by more than 70% between 1970 and 2004. In order to stabilize the climate change that is being driven by global warming, mitigation efforts seek to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In the words of the IPCC, Mitigation efforts over the next two to three decades will have a large impact on opportunities to achieve lower stabilization levels.Mitigation can be approached through demand-side management (such as behavioral changes to conserve energy), alternate sources of energy (with reduced or zero emissions, including renewable sources of energy), technologies that improve energy efficiency, and carbon capture and storage. One form of mitigation is an emphasis on sustainable development, including the use of green architecture to design buildings that make efficient use of energy and water (see Special Report) and the use of biofuels as a renewable energy source (see Special Report). Another important mitigation strategy to promote the conservation of energy is to put a price on carbon. By assigning costs to carbon-dioxide emissions and placing a value on the reduction of carbon-dioxide emissions, a carbon market can operate in which carbon credits are bought and sold to provide economic incentives to meet emission regulations.The IPCC has attempted to assess the potential costs of mitigation. Although the question is complex, there is some agreement that it would be on the order of 1% of global GDP. Some studies have also tried to assess the economic cost to society from the impacts of climate change with the assumption that no mitigation attempts are made. Although there is less certainty about these costs, there is agreement that they would very likely outweigh the cost of mitigation (for example, 15% of GDP globally, with the cost rising as high as 25% of GDP for LDCs).By the end of 2007, all major developed countries with the exception of the U.S. had ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the international treaty for developed nations to begin to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions. The protocol mandated restrictions of greenhouse-gas emissions for the period 2008-12. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference held in December 2007 in Bali, Indon., delegates used the findings of the IPCC fourth assessment to discuss what would succeed the protocol. Although many issues remained, the delegates reached a consensus on the course that would be followed to negotiate a post-Kyoto agreement to address climate change.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://search.eb.com.turing.library.northwestern.edu/eb/print?articleId=106248&fullArticle=true&tocId=272924<TEXT>Conditions of the atmosphere at a particular location over a long period of time; it is the long-term summation of the atmospheric elements (and their variations) that, over short time periods, constitute weather. These elements are solar radiation, temperature, humidity, precipitation (type, frequency, and amount), atmospheric pressure, and wind (speed and direction).From the ancient Greek origins of the word (an inclination or slope e.g., of the Sun's rays; a latitude zone of the Earth; a clime) and from its earliest usage in English, climate has been understood to mean the atmospheric conditions that prevail in a given region or zone. In the older form, clime, it was sometimes taken to include all aspects of the environment, including the natural vegetation. The best modern definitions of climate regard it as constituting the total experience of weather and atmospheric behavior over a number of years in a given region. Climate is not just the average weather (an obsolete, and always inadequate, definition). It should include not only the average values of the climatic elements that prevail at different times but also their extreme ranges and variability and the frequency of various occurrences. Just as one year differs from another, decades and centuries are found to differ from one another by a smaller, but sometimes significant, amount. Climate is therefore time-dependent, and climatic values or indexes should not be quoted without specifying what years they refer to.This article treats the factors that produce weather and climate and the complex processes that cause variations in both. Other major points of coverage include global climatic types and microclimates. The article also considers both the impact of climate on human life and the effects of human activities on climate. For details concerning the disciplines of meteorology and climatology, see climatic variation and change. See also the article atmosphere for further information about the properties and behavior of the atmospheric system. Relevant data on the influence of the oceans and of atmospheric moisture on climate can be found in hydrosphere.Air temperatures have their origin in the absorption of radiant energy from the Sun. They are subject to many influences, including those of the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and are modified by them. As variation of solar radiation is the single most important factor affecting climate, it is considered here first.Solar radiationDistribution of radiant energy from the SunNuclear fusion deep within the Sun releases a tremendous amount of energy that is slowly transferred to the solar surface, from which it is radiated into space. The planets intercept minute fractions of this energy, the amount depending on their size and distance from the Sun. A 1-square-meter (11-square-foot) area perpendicular (90) to the rays of the Sun at the top of Earth's atmosphere, for example, receives about 1,365 watts of solar power. (This amount is comparable to the power consumption of a typical electric heater.) Because of the slight ellipticity of Earth's orbit around the Sun, the amount of solar energy intercepted by Earth steadily rises and falls by 3.4 percent throughout the year, peaking on January 3, when Earth is closest to the Sun. Although about 31 percent of this energy is not used as it is scattered back to space, the remaining amount is sufficient to power the movement of atmospheric winds and oceanic currents and to sustain nearly all biospheric activity.Most surfaces are not perpendicular to the Sun, and the energy they receive depends on their solar elevation angle. (The maximum solar elevation is 90� for the overhead Sun.) This angle changes systematically with latitude, the time of year, and the time of day. The noontime elevation angle reaches a maximum at all latitudes north of the Tropic of Cancer (23.5� N) around June 22 and a minimum around December 22. South of the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5� S), the opposite holds true, and between the two tropics, the maximum elevation angle (90�) occurs twice a year. When the Sun has a lower elevation angle, the solar energy is less intense because it is spread out over a larger area. Variation of solar elevation is thus one of the main factors that accounts for the dependence of climatic regime on latitude. The other main factor is the length of daylight. For latitudes poleward of 66.5� N and S, the length of day ranges from zero (winter solstice) to 24 hours (summer solstice), whereas the Equator has a constant 12-hour day throughout the year. The seasonal range of temperature consequently decreases from high latitudes to the tropics, where it becomes less than the diurnal range of temperature.Effects of the atmosphereOf the radiant energy reaching the top of the atmosphere, 46 percent is absorbed by Earth's surface on average, but this value varies significantly from place to place, depending on cloudiness, surface type, and elevation. If there is persistent cloud cover, as exists in some equatorial regions, much of the incident solar radiation is scattered back to space, and very little is absorbed by Earth's surface. Water surfaces have low reflectivity (4-10 percent), except in low solar elevations, and are the most efficient absorbers. Snow surfaces, on the other hand, have high reflectivity (40-80 percent) and so are the poorest absorbers. High-altitude desert regions consistently absorb higher-than-average amounts of solar radiation because of the reduced effect of the atmosphere above them.An additional 23 percent or so of the incident solar radiation is absorbed on average in the atmosphere, especially by water vapor and clouds at lower altitudes and by ozone (O3) in the stratosphere. Absorption of solar radiation by ozone shields the terrestrial surface from harmful ultraviolet light and warms the stratosphere, producing maximum temperatures of -15 to 10 �C (5 to 50 �F) at an altitude of 50 km (30 miles). Most atmospheric absorption takes place at ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths, so more than 90 percent of the visible portion of the solar spectrum, with wavelengths between 0.4 and 0.7 mm (0.00002 to 0.00003 inch), reaches the surface on a cloud-free day. Visible light, however, is scattered in varying degrees by cloud droplets, air molecules, and dust particles. Blue skies and red sunsets are in effect attributable to the preferential scattering of short (blue) wavelengths by air molecules and small dust particles. Cloud droplets scatter visible wavelengths impartially (hence, clouds usually appear white) but very efficiently, so the reflectivity of clouds to solar radiation is typically about 50 percent and may be as high as 80 percent for thick clouds.The constant gain of solar energy by Earth's surface is systematically returned to space in the form of thermally emitted radiation in the infrared portion of the spectrum. The emitted wavelengths are mainly between 5 and 100 mm (0.0002 and 0.004 inch), and they interact differently with the atmosphere compared with the shorter wavelengths of solar radiation. Very little of the radiation emitted by Earth's surface passes directly through the atmosphere. Most of it is absorbed by clouds, carbon dioxide, and water vapor and is then reemitted in all directions. The atmosphere thus acts as a radiative blanket over Earth's surface, hindering the loss of heat to space. The blanketing effect is greatest in the presence of low clouds and weakest for clear cold skies that contain little water vapor. Without this effect, the mean surface temperature of 15 �C (59 �F) would be some 30 �C colder. Conversely, as atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons, and other absorbing gases continue to increase, in large part owing to human activities, surface temperatures should rise because of the capacity of such gases to trap infrared radiation. The exact amount of this temperature increase, however, remains uncertain because of unpredictable changes in other atmospheric components, especially cloud cover. An extreme example of such an effect (commonly dubbed the greenhouse effect) is that produced by the dense atmosphere of the planet Venus, which results in surface temperatures of about 475 �C (887 �F). This condition exists in spite of the fact that the high reflectivity of the Venusian clouds causes the planet to absorb less solar radiation than Earth.Average radiation budgetsThe difference between the solar radiation absorbed and the thermal radiation emitted to space determines Earth's radiation budget. Since there is no appreciable long-term trend in planetary temperature, it may be concluded that this budget is essentially zero on a global long-term average. Latitudinally, it has been found that much more solar radiation is absorbed at low latitudes than at high latitudes. On the other hand, thermal emission does not show nearly as strong a dependence on latitude, so the planetary radiation budget decreases systematically from the Equator to the poles. It changes from being positive to negative at latitudes of about 40� N and 40� S. The atmosphere and oceans, through their general circulation, act as vast heat engines, compensating for this imbalance by providing nonradiative mechanisms for the transfer of heat from the Equator to the poles.While Earth's surface absorbs a significant amount of thermal radiation because of the blanketing effect of the atmosphere, it loses even more through its own emission and thus experiences a net loss of long-wave radiation. This loss is only about 14 percent of the amount emitted by the surface and is less than the average gain of total absorbed solar energy. Consequently, the surface has on average a positive radiation budget.By contrast, the atmosphere emits thermal radiation both to space and to the surface, yet it receives long-wave radiation back from only the latter. This net loss of thermal energy cannot be compensated for by the modest gain of absorbed solar energy within the atmosphere. The atmosphere thus has a negative radiation budget, equal in magnitude to the positive radiation budget of the surface but opposite in sign. Nonradiative heat transfer again compensates for the imbalance, this time largely by vertical atmospheric motions involving the evaporation and condensation of water.Surface-energy budgetsThe rate of temperature change in any region is directly proportional to the region's energy budget and inversely proportional to its heat capacity. While the radiation budget may dominate the average energy budget of many surfaces, nonradiative energy transfer and storage also are generally important when local changes are considered.Foremost among the cooling effects is the energy required to evaporate surface moisture, which produces atmospheric water vapor. Most of the latent heat contained in water vapor is subsequently released to the atmosphere during the formation of precipitating clouds, although a minor amount may be returned directly to the surface during dew or frost deposition. Evaporation increases with rising surface temperature, decreasing relative humidity, and increasing surface wind speed. Transpiration by plants also increases evaporation rates, which explains why the temperature in an irrigated field is usually lower than that over a nearby dry road surface.Another important nonradiative mechanism is the exchange of heat that occurs when the temperature of the air is different from that of the surface. Depending on whether the surface is warmer or cooler than the air next to it, heat is transferred to or from the atmosphere by turbulent air motion (more loosely, by convection). This effect also increases with increasing temperature difference and with increasing surface wind speed. Direct heat transfer to the air may be an important cooling mechanism that limits the maximum temperature of hot dry surfaces. Alternatively, it may be an important warming mechanism that limits the minimum temperature of cold surfaces. Such warming is sensitive to wind speed, so calm conditions promote lower minimum temperatures.In a similar category, whenever a temperature difference occurs between the surface and the medium beneath the surface, there is a transfer of heat to or from the medium. In the case of land surfaces, heat is transferred by conduction, a process where energy is conveyed through a material from one atom or molecule to another. In the case of water surfaces, the transfer is by convection and may consequently be affected by the horizontal transport of heat within large bodies of water.Average values of the different terms in the energy budgets of the atmosphere and surface are given in the diagram. The individual terms may be adjusted to suit local conditions and may be used as an aid to understanding the various temperature characteristics discussed in the next section.TemperatureGlobal variation of mean temperatureGlobal variations of average surface-air temperatures are largely due to latitude, continentality, ocean currents, and prevailing winds.The effect of latitude is evident in the large north-south gradients in average temperature that occur at middle and high latitudes in each winter hemisphere. These gradients are due mainly to the rapid decrease of available solar radiation but also in part to the higher surface reflectivity at high latitudes associated with snow and ice and low solar elevations. A broad area of the tropical ocean, by contrast, shows little temperature variation.Continentality is a measure of the difference between continental and marine climates and is mainly the result of the increased range of temperatures that occurs over land compared with water. This difference is a consequence of the much lower effective heat capacities of land surfaces as well as of their generally reduced evaporation rates. Heating or cooling of a land surface takes place in a thin layer, the depth of which is determined by the ability of the ground to conduct heat. The greatest temperature changes occur for dry, sandy soils, because they are poor conductors with very small effective heat capacities and contain no moisture for evaporation. By far the greatest effective heat capacities are those of water surfaces, owing to both the mixing of water near the surface and the penetration of solar radiation that distributes heating to depths of several meters. In addition, about 90 percent of the radiation budget of the ocean is used for evaporation. Ocean temperatures are thus slow to change.The effect of continentality may be moderated by proximity to the ocean, depending on the direction and strength of the prevailing winds. Contrast with ocean temperatures at the edges of each continent may be further modified by the presence of a north- or south-flowing ocean current. For most latitudes, however, continentality explains much of the variation in average temperature at a fixed latitude as well as variations in the difference between January and July temperatures.Diurnal, seasonal, and extreme temperaturesThe diurnal range of temperature generally increases with distance from the sea and toward those places where solar radiation is strongest in dry tropical climates and on high mountain plateaus (owing to the reduced thickness of the atmosphere to be traversed by the Sun's rays). The average difference between the day's highest and lowest temperatures is 3 �C (5 �F) in January and 5 �C (9 �F) in July in those parts of the British Isles nearest the Atlantic. The difference is 4.5 �C (8 �F) in January and 6.5 �C (12 �F) in July on the small island of Malta. At Tashkent, Uzbekistan, it is 9 �C (16 �F) in January and 15.5 �C (28 �F) in July, and at Khartoum, Sudan, the corresponding figures are 17 �C (31 �F) and 13.5 �C (24 �F). At Kandahar, Afghanistan, which lies more than 1,000 meters (about 3,300 feet) above sea level, it is 14 �C (25 �F) in January and 20 �C (36 �F) in July. There, the average difference between the day's highest and lowest temperatures exceeds 23 �C (41 �F) in September and October, when there is less cloudiness than in July. Near the ocean at Colombo, Sri L., the figures are 8 �C (14 �F) in January and 4.5 �C (8 �F) in July.The seasonal variation of temperature and the magnitudes of the differences between the same month in different years and different epochs generally increase toward high latitudes and with distance from the ocean. Extreme temperatures observed in different parts of the world are listed in the table.Variation with heightThere are two main levels where the atmosphere is heated namely, at Earth's surface and at the top of the ozone layer (about 50 km, or 30 miles, up) in the stratosphere. Radiation balance shows a net gain at these levels in most cases. Prevailing temperatures tend to decrease with distance from these heating surfaces (apart from the ionosphere and the outer atmospheric layers, where other processes are at work). The world's average lapse rate of temperature (change with altitude) in the lower atmosphere is 0.6 to 0.7 �C per 100 meters (about 1.1 to 1.3 �F per 300 feet). Lower temperatures prevail with increasing height above sea level for two reasons: (1) because there is a less favorable radiation balance in the free air, and (2) because rising air whether lifted by convection currents above a relatively warm surface or forced up over mountains undergoes a reduction of temperature associated with its expansion as the pressure of the overlying atmosphere declines. This is the adiabatic lapse rate of temperature, which equals about 1 �C per 100 meters (about 2 �F per 300 feet) for dry air and 0.5 �C per 100 meters (about 1 �F per 300 feet) for saturated air, in which condensation (with liberation of latent heat) is produced by adiabatic cooling. The difference between these rates of change of temperature (and therefore density) of rising air currents and the state of the surrounding air determines whether the upward currents are accelerated or retarded i.e., whether the air is unstable, so vertical convection with its characteristically attendant tall cumulus cloud and shower development is encouraged or whether it is stable and convection is damped down.For these reasons, the air temperatures observed on hills and mountains are generally lower than on low ground, except in the case of extensive plateaus, which present a raised heating surface (and on still, sunny days, when even a mountain peak is able to warm appreciably the air that remains in contact with it).Circulation, currents, and ocean-atmosphere interactionThe circulation of the ocean is a key factor in air temperature distribution. Ocean currents that have a northward or southward component, such as the warm Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic or the cold Peru (Humboldt) Current off South America, effectively exchange heat between low and high latitudes. In tropical latitudes the ocean accounts for a third or more of the poleward heat transport; at latitude 50� N, the ocean's share is about one-seventh. In the particular sectors where the currents are located, their importance is of course much greater than these figures, which represent hemispheric averages.A good example of the effect of a warm current is that of the Gulf Stream in January, which causes a strong east-west gradient in temperatures across the eastern edge of the North American continent. The relative warmth of the Gulf Stream affects air temperatures all the way across the Atlantic, and prevailing westerlies extend the warming effect deep into northern Europe. As a result, January temperatures of Tromso, Nor. (69�40� N), for example, average 24 �C (43 �F) above the mean for that latitude. The Gulf Stream maintains a warming influence in July, but it is not as noticeable because of the effects of continentality.The ocean, particularly in areas where the surface is warm, also supplies moisture to the atmosphere. This in turn contributes to the heat budget of those areas in which the water vapor is condensed into clouds, liberating latent heat in the process. This set of events occurs frequently in high latitudes and in locations remote from the ocean where the moisture was initially taken up.The great ocean currents are themselves wind-driven set in motion by the drag of the winds over vast areas of the sea surface, especially where the tops of waves increase the friction with the air above. At the limits of the warm currents, particularly where they abut directly upon a cold current as at the left flank of the Gulf Stream in the neighborhood of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland and at the subtropical and Antarctic convergences in the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere the strong thermal gradients in the sea surface result in marked differences in the heating of the atmosphere on either side of the boundary. These temperature gradients tend to position and guide the strongest flow of the jet stream (see below Jet streams) in the atmosphere above and thereby influence the development and steering of weather systems.Interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere proceed in both directions. They also operate at different rates. Some interesting lag effects, which are of value in long-range weather forecasting, arise through the considerably slower circulation of the ocean. Thus, enhanced strength of the easterly trade winds over low latitudes of the Atlantic north and south of the Equator impels more water toward the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico, producing a stronger flow and greater warmth in the Gulf Stream approximately six months later. Anomalies in the position of the Gulf Stream Labrador Current boundary, which produce a greater or lesser extent of warm water near the Grand Banks, so affect the energy supply to the atmosphere and the development and steering of weather systems from that region that they are associated with rather persistent anomalies of weather pattern over the British Isles and northern Europe. Anomalies in the equatorial Pacific and in the northern limit of the Kuroshio Current (also called the Japan Current) seem to have effects on a similar scale. Indeed, through their influence on the latitude of the jet stream and the wavelength (that is, the spacing of cold trough and warm ridge regions) in the upper westerlies, these ocean anomalies exercise an influence over the atmospheric circulation that spreads to all parts of the hemisphere.Sea-surface temperature anomalies that recur in the equatorial Pacific at variable intervals of two to seven years can sometimes produce major climatic perturbations. One such anomaly is known as El Ni�o (Spanish for The Child; it was so named by Peruvian fishermen who noticed its onset during the Christmas season).During an El Ni�o event, warm surface water flows eastward from the equatorial Pacific, in at least partial response to weakening of the equatorial easterly winds, and replaces the normally cold upwelling surface water off the coast of Peru and Ecuador that is associated with the northward propagation of the cold Peru Current. The change in sea-surface temperature transforms the coastal climate from arid to wet. The event also affects atmospheric circulation in both hemispheres and is associated with changes in precipitation in regions of North America, Africa, and the western Pacific. For further information, see the section El Ni�o/Southern Oscillation.Short-term temperature changesMany interesting short-term temperature fluctuations also occur, usually in connection with local weather disturbances. The rapid passage of a mid-latitude cold front, for example, can drop temperatures by 10 �C (18 �F) in a few minutes and, if followed by the sustained movement of a cold air mass, by as much as 50 �C in 24 hours, with life-threatening implications for the unwary. Temperature increases of up to 40 �C in a few hours also are possible downwind of major mountain ranges when air that has been warmed by the release of latent heat on the windward side of a range is forced to descend rapidly on the other side (such a wind is variously called chinook, foehn, or Santa Ana). Changes of this kind, however, involve a wider range of meteorological processes than discussed in this section. For a more detailed treatment, see below Atmospheric pressure and wind.Atmospheric humidity and precipitationAtmospheric humidity, which is the amount of water vapor or moisture in the air, is another leading climatic element, as is precipitation. All forms of precipitation, including drizzle, rain, snow, ice crystals, and hail, are produced as a result of the condensation of atmospheric moisture that forms clouds in which some of the particles, by growth and aggregation, attain sufficient size to fall from the clouds and reach the ground.Atmospheric humidityAt 30 �C (86 �F), 4 percent of the volume of the air may be occupied by water molecules, but, where the air is colder than -40 �C (-40 �F), less than one-fifth of 1 percent of the air molecules can be water. Although the water vapor content may vary from one air parcel to another, these limits can be set because vapor capacity is determined by temperature. Temperature has profound effects upon some of the indexes of humidity, regardless of the presence or absence of vapor.The connection between an effect of humidity and an index of humidity requires simultaneous introduction of effects and indexes. Vapor in the air is a determinant of weather, because it first absorbs the thermal radiation that leaves and cools Earth's surface and then emits thermal radiation that warms the planet. Calculation of absorption and emission requires an index of the mass of water in a volume of air. Vapor also affects the weather because, as indicated above, it condenses into clouds and falls as rain or other forms of precipitation. Tracing the moisture-bearing air masses requires a humidity index that changes only when water is removed or added.Humidity indexesAbsolute humidityAbsolute humidity is the vapor concentration or density in the air. If mv is the mass of vapor in a volume of air, then absolute humidity dv is simply dv = mv/ V, in which V is the volume and dv is expressed in grams per cubic meter. This index indicates how much vapor a beam of radiation must pass through. The ultimate standard in humidity measurement is made by weighing the amount of water gained by an absorber when a known volume of air passes through it; this measures absolute humidity, which may vary from 0 gram per cubic meter in dry air to 30 grams per cubic meter (0.03 ounce per cubic foot) when the vapor is saturated at 30 �C. The dv of a parcel of air changes, however, with temperature or pressure even though no water is added or removed, because, as the gas equation states, the volume V increases with the absolute, or Kelvin, temperature and decreases with the pressure.Specific humidityThe meteorologist requires an index of humidity that does not change with pressure or temperature. A property of this sort will identify an air mass when it is cooled or when it rises to lower pressures aloft without losing or gaining water vapor. Because all the gases will expand equally, the ratios of the weight of water to the weight of dry air, or the dry air plus vapor, will be conserved during such changes and will continue identifying the air mass.The mixing ratio r is the dimensionless ratio r = mv/ ma, where ma is the mass of dry air, and the specific humidity q is another dimensionless ratio q = mv/ (ma + mv). Because mv is less than 3 percent of ma at normal pressure and temperatures cooler than 30 �C, r and q are practically equal. These indexes are usually expressed in grams per kilogram because they are so small; the values range from 0 grams per kilogram in dry air to 28 grams per kilogram in saturated air at 30 �C. Absolute and specific humidity indexes have specialized uses, so they are not familiar to most people.Relative humidityRelative humidity (U) is so commonly used that a statement of humidity, without a qualifying adjective, can be assumed to be relative humidity. U can be defined, then, in terms of the mixing ratio r that was introduced above. U = 100r/ rw, which is a dimensionless percentage. The divisor rw is the saturation mixing ratio, or the vapor capacity. Relative humidity is therefore the water vapor content of the air relative to its content at saturation. Because the saturation mixing ratio is a function of pressure, and especially of temperature, the relative humidity is a combined index of the environment that reflects more than water content. In many climates the relative humidity rises to about 100 percent at dawn and falls to 50 percent by noon. A relative humidity of 50 percent may reflect many different quantities of vapor per volume of air or gram of air, and it will not likely be proportional to evaporation.An understanding of relative humidity thus requires a knowledge of saturated vapor, which will be discussed later in the section on the relation between temperature and humidity. At this point, however, the relation between U and the absorption and retention of water from the air must be considered. Small pores retain water more strongly than large pores; thus, when a porous material is set out in the air, all pores larger than a certain size (which can be calculated from the relative humidity of the air) are dried out.The water content of a porous material at air temperature is fairly well indicated by the relative humidity. The complexity of actual pore sizes and the viscosity of the water passing through them makes the relation between U and moisture in the porous material imperfect and slowly achieved. The great suction also strains the walls of the capillaries, and the consequent shrinkage is used to measure relative humidity.The absorption of water by salt solutions is also related to relative humidity without much effect of temperature. The air above water saturated with sodium chloride is maintained at 75 to 76 percent relative humidity at a temperature between 0 and 40 �C (32 and 104 �F).In effect, relative humidity is a widely used environmental indicator, but U does respond drastically to changes in temperatures as well as moisture, a response caused by the effect of temperature upon the divisor rW in U.Relation between temperature and humidityTables that show the effect of temperature upon the saturation mixing ratio rw are readily available. Humidity of the air at saturation is expressed more commonly, however, as vapor pressure. Thus, it is necessary to understand vapor pressure and in particular the gaseous nature of water vapor.The pressure of the water vapor, which contributes to the pressure of the atmosphere, can be calculated from the absolute humidity dv by the gas equation:in which R is the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, Mw the molecular weight of water, and e the water vapor pressure in millibars (mb).Relative humidity can be defined as the ratio of the vapor pressure of a sample of air to the saturation pressure at the existing temperature. Further, the capacity for vapor and the effect of temperature can now be presented in the usual terms of saturation vapor pressure.Within a pool of liquid water, some molecules are continually escaping from the liquid into the space above, while more and more vapor molecules return to the liquid as the concentration of vapor rises. Finally, equal numbers are escaping and returning; the vapor is then saturated, and its pressure is known as the saturation vapor pressure, ew. If the liquid and vapor are warmed, relatively more molecules escape than return, and ew rises. There is also a saturation pressure with respect to ice. The vapor pressure curve of water has the same form as the curves for many other substances. Its location is fixed, however, by the boiling point of 100 �C (212 �F), where the saturation vapor pressure of water vapor is 1,013 mb (1 standard atmosphere), the standard pressure of the atmosphere at sea level. The decrease of the boiling point with altitude can be calculated. For example, the saturation vapor pressure at 40 �C (104 �F) is 74 mb (0.07 standard atmosphere), and the standard atmospheric pressure near 18,000 meters (59,000 feet) above sea level is also 74 mb; thus, it is where water boils at 40� C.The everyday response of relative humidity to temperature can be easily explained. On a summer morning, the temperature might be 15 �C (59 �F) and the relative humidity 100 percent. The vapor pressure would be 17 mb (0.02 standard atmosphere) and the mixing ratio about 11 parts per thousand (11 grams of water per kilogram of air by weight). During the day the air could warm to 25 �C (77 �F), while evaporation could add little water. At 25 �C the saturation pressure is fully 32 mb (0.03 standard atmosphere). If, however, little water has been added to the air, its vapor pressure will still be about 17 mb. Thus, with no change in vapor content, the relative humidity of the air has fallen from 100 to only 53 percent, illustrating why relative humidity does not identify air masses.The meaning of dew-point temperature can be illustrated by a sample of air with a vapor pressure of 17 mb. If an object at 15 �C is brought into the air, dew will form on the object. Hence, 15 �C is the dew-point temperature of the air i.e., the temperature at which the vapor present in a sample of air would just cause saturation or the temperature whose saturation vapor pressure equals the present vapor pressure in a sample of air. Below freezing, this index is called the frost point. There is a one-to-one correspondence between vapor pressure and dew point. The dew point has the virtue of being easily interpreted because it is the temperature at which a blade of grass or a pane of glass will become wet with dew from the air. Ideally, it is also the temperature of fog or cloud formation.The clear meaning of dew point suggests a means of measuring humidity. A dew-point hygrometer was invented in 1751. For this instrument, cold water was added to water in a vessel until dew formed on the vessel, and the temperature of the vessel, the dew point, provided a direct index of humidity. The greatest use of the condensation hygrometer has been to measure humidity in the upper atmosphere, where a vapor pressure of less than a thousandth millibar makes other means impractical.Another index of humidity, the saturation deficit, can also be understood by considering air with a vapor pressure of 17 mb. At 25 �C the air has (31 - 17), or 14, mb less vapor pressure than saturated vapor at the same temperature; that is, the saturation deficit is 14 mb (0.01 standard atmosphere).The saturation deficit has the particular utility of being proportional to the evaporation capability of the air. The saturation deficit can be expressed asand, because the saturation vapor pressure ew rises with rising temperature, the same relative humidity will correspond to a greater saturation deficit and evaporation at warm temperatures.Humidity and climateThe small amount of water in atmospheric vapor, relative to water on Earth, belies its importance. Compared with one unit of water in the air, the seas contain at least 100,000 units, the great glaciers 1,500, the porous earth nearly 200, and the rivers and lakes 4 or 5. The effectiveness of the vapor in the air is magnified, however, by its role in transferring water from sea to land by the media of clouds and precipitation and that in absorbing radiation.The vapor in the air is the invisible conductor that carries water from sea to land, making terrestrial life possible. Fresh water is distilled from the salt seas and carried over land by the wind. Water evaporates from vegetation, and rain falls on the sea too, but the sea is the bigger source, and rain that falls on land is most important to humans. The invisible vapor becomes visible near the surface as fog when the air cools to the dew point. The usual nocturnal cooling will produce fog patches in cool valleys. Or the vapor may move as a tropical air mass over cold land or sea, causing widespread and persistent fog, such as occurs over the Grand Banks off Newfoundland. The delivery of water by means of fog or dew is slight, however.When air is lifted, it is carried to a region of lower pressure, where it will expand and cool as described by the gas equation. It may rise up a mountain slope or over the front of a cooler, denser air mass. If condensation nuclei are absent, the dew point may be exceeded by the cooling air, and the water vapor becomes supersaturated. If nuclei are present or if the temperature is very low, however, cloud droplets or ice crystals form, and the vapor is no longer in the invisible guise of atmospheric humidity.The invisible vapor has another climatic role namely, absorbing and emitting radiation. The temperature of Earth and its daily variation are determined by the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation. The wavelength of the incoming radiation from the Sun is mostly shorter than 3 mm (0.0001 inch). It is scarcely absorbed by water vapor, and its receipt depends largely upon cloud cover. The radiation exchanged between the atmosphere and Earth's surface and the eventual loss to space is in the form of long waves. These long waves are strongly absorbed in the 3- to 8.5-mm band and in the greater than 11-mm range, where vapor is either partly or wholly opaque. As noted above, much of the radiation that is absorbed in the atmosphere is emitted back to Earth, and the surface receipt of long waves, primarily from water vapor and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, is slightly more than twice the direct receipt of solar radiation at the surface. Thus, the invisible vapor in the atmosphere combines with clouds and the advection (horizontal movement) of air from different regions to control the surface temperature.The world distribution of humidity can be portrayed for different uses by different indexes. To appraise the quantity of water carried by the entire atmosphere, the moisture in an air column above a given point on Earth is expressed as a depth of liquid water. It varies from 0.5 mm (0.02 inch) over the Himalayas and 2 mm (0.08 inch) over the poles in winter to 8 mm (0.3 inch) over the Sahara, 54 mm (2 inches) in the Amazon region, and 64 mm (2.5 inches) over India during the wet season. During summer the air over the United States transports 16 mm (0.6 inch) of water vapor over the Great Basin and 45 mm (1.8 inches) over Florida.The humidity of the surface air may be mapped as vapor pressure, but a map of this variable looks much like that of temperature. Warm places are moist, and cool ones are dry; even in deserts the vapor pressure is normally 13 mb (0.01 standard atmosphere), whereas over the northern seas it is only about 4 mb (0.004 standard atmosphere). Certainly the moisture in materials in two such areas will be just the opposite, so relative humidity is a more widely useful index.Average relative humidityThe average relative humidity for July reveals the humidity provinces of the Northern Hemisphere when aridity is at a maximum. At other times the relative humidity generally will be higher. The humidities over the Southern Hemisphere in July indicate the humidities that comparable regions in the Northern Hemisphere will attain in January, just as July in the Northern Hemisphere suggests the humidities in the Southern Hemisphere during January. A contrast is provided by comparing a humid cool coast to a desert. The midday humidity on the Oregon coast, for example, falls only to 80 percent, whereas in the Nevada desert it falls to 20 percent. At night the contrast is less, with averages being over 90 and about 50 percent, respectively.Although the dramatic regular decrease of relative humidity from dawn to midday has been attributed largely to warming rather than declining vapor content, the content does vary regularly. In humid environments, daytime evaporation increases the water vapor content of the air, and the mixing ratio, which may be about 12 grams per kilogram, rises by 1 or 2 grams per kilogram in temperate places and may attain 16 grams per kilogram in a tropical rainforest. In arid environments, however, little evaporation moistens the air, and daytime turbulence tends to bring down dry air; this decreases the mixing ratio by as much as 2 grams per kilogram.Humidity also varies regularly with altitude. On the average, fully half the water in the atmosphere lies below 0.25 km (about 0.2 mile), and satellite observations over the United States in April revealed 1 mm (0.04 inch) or less of water in all the air above 6 km (4 miles). A cross section of the atmosphere along 75� W longitude shows a decrease in humidity with height and toward the poles. The mixing ratio is 16 grams per kilogram just north of the Equator, but it decreases to 1 gram per kilogram at 50� N latitude or 8 km (5 miles) above the Equator. The transparent air surrounding mountains in fair weather is very dry indeed.Closer to the ground, the water vapor content also changes with height in a regular pattern. When water vapor is condensing on Earth's surface at night, the content is greater aloft than at the ground; during the day the content is, in most cases, less aloft than at the ground because of evaporation.Evaporation and humidityEvaporation, mostly from the sea and from vegetation, replenishes the humidity of the air. It is the change of liquid water into a gaseous state, but it may be analyzed as diffusion. The rate of diffusion, or evaporation, will be proportional to the difference between the pressure of the water vapor in the free air and the vapor that is next to, and saturated by, the evaporating liquid. If the liquid and air have the same temperature, evaporation is proportional to the saturation deficit. It is also proportional to the conductivity of the medium between the evaporator and the free air. If the evaporator is open water, the conductivity will increase with ventilation. But if the evaporator is a leaf, the diffusing water must pass through the still air within the minute pores between the water inside and the dry air outside. In this case the porosity may modify the conductivity more than ventilation.The temperature of the evaporator is rarely the same as the air temperature, however, because each gram of evaporation consumes about 600 calories (2,500 joules) and thus cools the evaporator. The availability of energy to heat the evaporator is therefore as important as the saturation deficit and conductivity of the air. Outdoors, some of this heat may be transferred from the surrounding air by convection, but much of it must be furnished by radiation. Evaporation is faster on sunny days than on cloudy ones not only because the sunny day may have drier air but also because the Sun warms the evaporator and thus raises the vapor pressure at the evaporator. In fact, according to the well-known Penman calculation of evaporation (an equation that considers potential evaporation as a function of humidity, wind speed, radiation, and temperature), this loss of water is essentially determined by the net radiation balance during the day.Precipitation is one of the three main processes (evaporation, condensation, and precipitation) that constitute the hydrologic cycle, the continual exchange of water between the atmosphere and Earth's surface. Water evaporates from ocean, land, and freshwater surfaces, is carried aloft as vapor by the air currents, condenses to form clouds, and ultimately is returned to Earth's surface as precipitation. The average global stock of water vapor in the atmosphere is equivalent to a layer of water 2.5 cm (1 inch) deep covering the whole Earth. Because Earth's average annual rainfall is about 100 cm (39 inches), the average time that the water spends in the atmosphere, between its evaporation from the surface and its return as precipitation, is about 1/40 of a year, or about nine days. Of the water vapor that is carried at all heights across a given region by the winds, only a small percentage is converted into precipitation and reaches the ground in that area. In deep and extensive cloud systems, the conversion is more efficient, but even in thunderclouds the quantities of rain and hail released amount to only some 10 percent of the total moisture entering the storm.In the measurement of precipitation, it is necessary to distinguish between the amount defined as the depth of precipitation (calculated as though it were all rain) that has fallen at a given point during a specified interval of time and the rate or intensity, which specifies the depth of water that has fallen at a point during a particular interval of time. Persistent moderate rain, for example, might fall at an average rate of 5 mm per hour (0.2 inch per hour) and thus produce 120 mm (4.7 inches) of rain in 24 hours. A thunderstorm might produce this total quantity of rain in 20 minutes, but at its peak intensity the rate of rainfall might become much greater perhaps 120 mm per hour (4.7 inches per hour), or 2mm (0.08 inch) per minute for a minute or two.The amount of precipitation falling during a fixed period is measured regularly at many thousands of places on Earth's surface by rather simple rain gauges. Measurement of precipitation intensity requires a recording rain gauge, in which water falling into a collector of known surface area is continuously recorded on a moving chart or a magnetic tape. Investigations are being carried out on the feasibility of obtaining continuous measurements of rainfall over large catchment areas by means of radar.Apart from the trifling contributions made by dew, frost, and rime, as well as desalination plants, the sole source of fresh water for sustaining rivers, lakes, and all life on Earth is provided by precipitation from clouds. Precipitation is therefore indispensable and overwhelmingly beneficial to humankind, but extremely heavy rainfall can cause great harm: soil erosion, landslides, and flooding. Hailstorm damage to crops, buildings, and livestock can prove very costly.Origin of precipitation in cloudsCloud formationClouds are formed by the lifting of damp air, which cools by expansion as it encounters the lower pressures existing at higher levels in the atmosphere. The relative humidity increases until the air has become saturated with water vapor, and then condensation occurs on any of the aerosol particles suspended in the air. A wide variety of these exist in concentrations ranging from only a few per cubic centimeter in clean maritime air to perhaps 1 million per cubic cm (16 million per cubic inch) in the highly polluted air of an industrial city. For continuous condensation leading to the formation of cloud droplets, the air must be slightly supersaturated. Among the highly efficient condensation nuclei are sea-salt particles and the particles produced by combustion (e.g., natural forest fires and man-made fires). Many of the larger condensation nuclei over land consist of ammonium sulfate. These are produced by cloud and fog droplets absorbing sulfur dioxide and ammonia from the air. Condensation onto the nuclei continues as rapidly as water vapor is made available through cooling; droplets about 10 mm (0.0004 inch) in diameter are produced in this manner. These droplets constitute a nonprecipitating cloud.Cloud typesThe meteorologist classifies clouds mainly by their appearance, according to an international system similar to one proposed in 1803. But because the dimensions, shape, structure, and texture of clouds are influenced by the kind of air movements that result in their formation and growth and by the properties of the cloud particles, much of what was originally a purely visual classification can now be justified on physical grounds.The first International Cloud Atlas was published in 1896. Developments in aviation during World War I stimulated interest in cloud formations and in their importance as an aid in short-range weather forecasting. This led to the publication of a more extensive atlas, the International Atlas of Clouds and States of Sky, in 1932 and to a revised edition in 1939. After World War II, the World Meteorological Organization published a new International Cloud Atlas (1956) in two volumes. It contains 224 plates, describing 10 main cloud genera (families) subdivided into 14 species based on cloud shape and structure. Nine general varieties, based on transparency and geometric arrangement, also are described. The genera, listed according to their height, are as follows:Heights given are approximate averages for temperate latitudes. Clouds of each genus are generally lower in the polar regions and higher in the tropics.Four principal classes are recognized when clouds are classified according to the kind of air motions that produce them: (1) layer clouds formed by the widespread regular ascent of air, (2) layer clouds formed by widespread irregular stirring or turbulence, (3) cumuliform clouds formed by penetrative convection, and (4) orographic clouds formed by the ascent of air over hills and mountains.The widespread layer clouds associated with cyclonic depressions (see below Cyclones and anticyclones), near fronts and other inclement-weather systems, are frequently composed of several layers that may extend up to 9 km (5.6 miles) or more, separated by clear zones that become filled in as rain or snow develops. These clouds are formed by the slow, prolonged ascent of a deep layer of air, in which a rise of only a few centimeters per second is maintained for several hours. In the neighbourhood of fronts, vertical velocities become more pronounced and may reach about 10 cm (4 inches) per second.Most of the high cirrus clouds visible from the ground lie on the fringes of cyclonic cloud systems, and, though due primarily to regular ascent, their pattern is often determined by local wave disturbances that finally trigger their formation after the air has been brought near its saturation point by the large-scale lifting.On a cloudless night, the ground cools by radiating heat into space without heating the air adjacent to the ground. If the air were quite still, only a very thin layer would be chilled by contact with the ground. More usually, however, the lower layers of the air are stirred by motion over the rough ground, so the cooling is distributed through a much greater depth. Consequently, when the air is damp or the cooling is great, a fog a few hundred meters deep may form, rather than a dew produced by condensation on the ground.In moderate or strong winds, the irregular stirring near the surface distributes the cooling upward, and the fog may lift from the surface to become a stratus cloud, which is not often more than 600 meters (about 2,000 feet) thick.Radiational cooling from the upper surfaces of fogs and stratus clouds promotes an irregular convection within the cloud layer and causes the surfaces to have a waved or humped appearance. When the cloud layer is shallow, billows and clear spaces may develop; it is then described as stratocumulus instead of stratus.Usually, cumuliform clouds appearing over land are formed by the rise of discrete masses of air from near the sunlight-warmed surface. These rising lumps of air, or thermals, may vary in diameter from a few tens to hundreds of meters as they ascend and mix with the cooler, drier air above them. Above the level of the cloud base, the release of latent heat of condensation tends to increase the buoyancy of the rising masses, which tower upward and emerge at the top of the cloud with rounded upper surfaces.At any moment a large cloud may contain a number of active thermals and the residues of earlier ones. A new thermal rising into a residual cloud will be partially protected from having to mix with the cool, dry environment and therefore may rise farther than its predecessor. Once a thermal has emerged as a cloud turret at the summit or the flanks of the cloud, rapid evaporation of the droplets chills the cloud borders, destroys the buoyancy, and produces sinking. A cumulus thus has a characteristic pyramidal shape and, viewed from a distance, appears to have an unfolding motion, with fresh cloud masses continually emerging from the interior to form the summit and then sinking aside and evaporating.In settled weather, cumulus clouds are well scattered and small; horizontal and vertical dimensions are only a kilometer or two. In disturbed weather, they cover a large part of the sky, and individual clouds may tower as high as 10 km (6 miles) or more, often ceasing their growth only upon reaching the stable stratosphere. These clouds produce heavy showers, hail, and thunderstorms .At the level of the cloud base, the speed of the rising air masses is usually about 1 meter (3.3 feet) per second but may reach 5 meters (16 feet) per second, and similar values are measured inside smaller clouds. The upcurrents in thunderclouds, however, often exceed 5 meters per second and may reach 30 meters (98 feet) per second or more.The rather special orographic clouds are produced by the ascent of air over hills and mountains. The air stream is set into oscillation when it is forced over the hill, and the clouds form in the crests of the (almost) stationary waves. There may thus be a succession of such clouds stretching downwind of the mountain, which remain stationary relative to the ground in spite of strong winds that may be blowing through the clouds. The clouds have very smooth outlines and are called lenticular (lens-shaped) or wave clouds. Thin wave clouds may form at great heights (up to 10 km, even over hills only a few hundred meters high) and occasionally are observed in the stratosphere (at 20 to 30 km [12 to 19 miles]) over the mountains of Norway, Scotland, Iceland, and Alaska. These atmospheric wave clouds are known as nacreous or mother-of-pearl clouds because of their brilliant iridescent colours.Mechanisms of precipitation releaseGrowing clouds are sustained by upward air currents, which may vary in strength from a few centimeters per second to several meters per second. Considerable growth of the cloud droplets (with falling speeds of only about 1 cm, or 0.4 inch, per second) is therefore necessary if they are to fall through the cloud, survive evaporation in the unsaturated air below, and reach the ground as drizzle or rain. The production of a few large particles from a large population of much smaller ones may be achieved in one of two ways. The first of these depends on the fact that cloud droplets are seldom of uniform size; droplets form on nuclei of various sizes and grow under slightly different conditions and for different lengths of time in different parts of the cloud. A droplet appreciably larger than average will fall faster than the smaller ones and so will collide and fuse (coalesce) with some of those that it overtakes. Calculations show that, in a deep cloud containing strong upward air currents and high concentrations of liquid water, such a droplet will have a sufficiently long journey among its smaller neighbours to grow to raindrop size. This coalescence mechanism is responsible for the showers that fall in tropical and subtropical regions from clouds whose tops do not reach altitudes where air temperatures are below 0 �C (32 �F) and therefore cannot contain ice crystals. Radar evidence also suggests that showers in temperate latitudes may sometimes be initiated by the coalescence of waterdrops, although the clouds may later reach heights at which ice crystals may form in their upper parts.The second method of releasing precipitation can operate only if the cloud top reaches elevations at which air temperatures are below 0 �C and the droplets in the upper cloud regions become supercooled. At temperatures below -40 �C (-40 �F), the droplets freeze automatically or spontaneously. At higher temperatures, they can freeze only if they are infected with special minute particles called ice nuclei. The origin and nature of these nuclei are not known with certainty, but the most likely source is clay-silicate particles carried up from the ground by the wind. As the temperature falls below 0 �C, more and more ice nuclei become active, and ice crystals appear in increasing numbers among the supercooled droplets. Such a mixture of supercooled droplets and ice crystals is unstable, however. The cloudy air is usually only slightly supersaturated with water vapor with respect to the droplets and is strongly oversaturated with respect to ice crystals; the latter thus grow more rapidly than the droplets. After several minutes, the growing crystals acquire falling speeds of tens of centimeters per second, and several of them may become joined to form a snowflake. In falling into the warmer regions of the cloud, this flake may melt and hit ground as a raindrop.The deep, extensive, multilayer cloud systems, from which precipitation of a widespread persistent character falls, are generally formed in cyclonic depressions (lows) and near fronts. Cloud systems of this type are associated with feeble upcurrents of only a few centimeters per second that last for at least several hours. Although the structure of these great rain-cloud systems is being explored by aircraft and radar, it is not yet well understood. That such systems rarely produce rain, as distinct from drizzle, unless their tops are colder than about -12 �C (10 �F) suggests that ice crystals are mainly responsible. This view is supported by the fact that the radar signals from these clouds usually take a characteristic form that has been clearly identified with the melting of snowflakes.Showers, thunderstorms, and hailPrecipitation from shower clouds and thunderstorms, whether in the form of raindrops, pellets of soft hail, or true hailstones, is generally of great intensity and shorter duration than that from layer clouds and is usually composed of larger particles. The clouds are characterized by their large vertical depth, strong vertical air currents, and high concentrations of liquid water, all factors favouring the rapid growth of precipitation elements by the accretion of cloud droplets.In a cloud composed wholly of liquid water, raindrops may grow by coalescence. For example, a droplet being carried up from the cloud base grows as it ascends by sweeping up smaller droplets. When it becomes too heavy to be supported by the upcurrents, the droplet falls, continuing to grow by the same process on its downward journey. Finally, if the cloud is sufficiently deep, the droplet will emerge from its base as a raindrop.In a dense, vigorous cloud several kilometers deep, the drop may attain its limiting stable diameter (about 6 mm [0.2 inch]) before reaching the cloud base and thus will break up into several large fragments. Each of these may continue to grow and attain breakup size. The number of raindrops may increase so rapidly in this manner that after a few minutes the accumulated mass of water can no longer be supported by the upcurrents and falls as a heavy shower. These conditions occur more readily in tropical regions. In temperate regions where the freezing level (0 �C) is much lower in elevation, conditions are more favorable for the ice-crystal mechanism.The hailstones that fall from deep, vigorous clouds in warm weather consist of a core surrounded by several alternate layers of clear and opaque ice. When the growing particle traverses a region of relatively high air temperature or high concentration of liquid water, or both, the transfer of heat from the hailstone to the air cannot occur rapidly enough to allow all of the deposited water to freeze immediately. This results in the formation of a wet coating of slushy ice, which may later freeze to form a layer of compact, relatively transparent ice. If the hailstone then enters a region of lower temperature and lower water content, the impacting droplets may freeze individually to produce ice of relatively low density with air spaces between the droplets. The alternate layers are formed as the stone passes through regions in which the combination of air temperature, liquid-water content, and updraft speed allows alternately wet and dry growth.It is held by some authorities that lightning is closely associated with the appearance of precipitation, especially in the form of soft hail, and that the charge and the strong electric fields are produced by ice crystals or cloud droplets striking and bouncing off the undersurfaces of the hail pellets. For a detailed discussion of electrical effects in clouds, see below thunderstorms.Types of precipitationDrizzleLiquid precipitation in the form of very small drops, with diameters between 0.2 and 0.5 mm (0.008 and 0.02 inch) and terminal velocities between 70 and 200 cm per second (28 and 79 inches per second), is defined as drizzle. It forms by the coalescence of even smaller droplets in low-layer clouds containing weak updrafts of only a few centimeters per second. High relative humidity below the cloud base is required to prevent the drops from evaporating before reaching the ground; drizzle is classified as slight, moderate, or thick. Slight drizzle produces negligible runoff from the roofs of buildings, and thick drizzle accumulates at a rate in excess of 1 mm per hour (0.04 inch per hour).Rain and freezing rainLiquid water drops with diameters greater than those of drizzle constitute rain. Raindrops rarely exceed 6 mm (0.2 inch) in diameter because they become unstable when larger than this and break up during their fall. The terminal velocities of raindrops at ground level range from 2 meters per second (7 feet per second) for the smallest to about 10 meters per second (30 feet per second) for the largest. The smaller raindrops are kept nearly spherical by surface-tension forces, but, as the diameter surpasses about 2 mm (0.08 inch), they become increasingly flattened by aerodynamic forces. When the diameter reaches 6 mm, the undersurface of the drop becomes concave because of the airstream, and the surface of the drop is sheared off to form a rapidly expanding bubble or bag attached to an annular ring containing the bulk of the water. Eventually the bag bursts into a spray of fine droplets, and the ring breaks up into a circlet of millimeter-sized drops.Rain of a given intensity is composed of a spectrum of drop sizes, the average and median drop diameters being larger in rains of greater intensity. The largest drops, which have a diameter greater than 5 mm (0.2 inch), appear only in the heavy rains of intense storms.When raindrops fall through a cold layer of air (colder than 0 �C, or 32 �F) and become supercooled, freezing rain occurs. The drops may freeze on impact with the ground to form a very slippery and dangerous glazed ice that is difficult to see because it is almost transparent.Snow and sleetSnow in the atmosphere can be subdivided into ice crystals and snowflakes. Ice crystals generally form on ice nuclei at temperatures appreciably below the freezing point. Below -40 �C (-40 �F) water vapor can solidify without the presence of a nucleus. Snowflakes are aggregates of ice crystals that appear in an infinite variety of shapes, mainly at temperatures near the freezing point of water.In British terminology, sleet is the term used to describe precipitation of snow and rain together or of snow melting as it falls. In the United States, it is used to denote partly frozen ice pellets.Snow crystals generally have a hexagonal pattern, often with beautifully intricate shapes. Three- and 12-branched forms occur occasionally. The hexagonal form of the atmospheric ice crystals, their varying size and shape notwithstanding, is an outward manifestation of an internal arrangement in which the oxygen atoms form an open lattice (network) with hexagonally symmetrical structure. According to a recent internationally accepted classification, there are seven types of snow crystals: plates, stellars, columns, needles, spatial dendrites, capped columns, and irregular crystals. The size and shape of the snow crystals depend mainly on the temperature of their formation and on the amount of water vapor that is available for deposition. The two principal influences are not independent; the possible water vapor admixture of the air decreases strongly with decreasing temperature. The vapor pressure in equilibrium, or state of balance, with a level surface of pure ice is 50 times greater at -2 �C (28 �F) than at -42 �C (-44 �F), the likely limits of snow formation in the air. Crystal shape and temperature at formation are related in the table.At temperatures above about -40 �C (-40 �F), the crystals form on nuclei of very small size that float in the air (heterogeneous nucleation). The nuclei consist predominantly of silicate minerals of terrestrial origin, mainly clay minerals and micas. At still lower temperatures, ice may form directly from water vapor (homogeneous nucleation). The influence of the atmospheric water vapor depends mainly on its degree of supersaturation with respect to ice.If the air contains a large excess of water vapor, the snow particles will grow fast, and there may be a tendency for dendritic (branching) growth. With low temperature, the excess water vapor tends to be small, and the crystals remain small. In relatively dry layers, the snow particles generally have simple forms. Complicated forms of crystals will cling together with others to form snowflakes that consist occasionally of up to 100 crystals; the diameter of such flakes may be as large as 2.5 cm (1 inch). This process will be furthered if the crystals are near the freezing point and wet, possibly by collision with undercooled water droplets. If a crystal falls into a cloud with great numbers of such drops, it will sweep some of them up. Coming into contact with ice, they freeze and form an ice cover around the crystal. Such particles are called soft hail or graupel .Snow particles constitute the clouds of cirrus type namely cirrus, cirrostratus, and cirrocumulus and many clouds of alto type. Ice and snow clouds originate normally only at temperatures some degrees below the freezing point; they predominate at -20 �C (-4 �F). In temperate and low latitudes these clouds occur in the higher layers of the troposphere. In tropical regions they hardly ever occur below 4,570 meters (15,000 feet). On high mountains and particularly in polar regions, they can occur near the surface and may appear as ice fogs. If cold air near the ground is overlain by warmer air (a very common occurrence in polar regions, especially in winter), mixture at the border leads to supersaturation in the cold air. Small ice columns and needles, diamond dust, will be formed and will float down, glittering, even from a cloudless sky. In the coldest parts of Antarctica, where temperatures near the surface are below -50 �C (-58 �F) on the average and rarely above -30 �C (-22 �F), the formation of diamond dust is a common occurrence. The floating and falling ice crystals produce in the light of the Sun and the Moon the manifold phenomena of atmospheric optics, halos, arcs, circles, mock suns, some coronas, and iridescent clouds. Most of the different optical appearances can be explained by the shapes of the crystals and their position with respect to the light source.Most of the moderate to heavy rain in temperate latitudes depends on the presence of ice and snow particles in clouds. In the free atmosphere, droplets of fluid water can be undercooled considerably; typical ice clouds originate mainly at a temperature near -20 �C. At an identical temperature below the freezing point, the water molecules are kept more firmly in the solid than in the fluid state. The equilibrium pressure of the gaseous phase is smaller in contact with ice than with water. At -20 �C, which is the temperature of the formation of typical ice clouds (cirrus), the equilibrium pressure with respect to undercooled water (relative humidity 100 percent) is 22 percent greater than the equilibrium pressure of the water vapor in contact with ice. Hence, with an excess of water vapor beyond the equilibrium state, the ice particles tend to incorporate more water vapor and to grow more rapidly than the water droplets.Being larger and so less retarded by friction, the ice particles fall more rapidly. In their fall they sweep up some water droplets, which on contact become frozen. Thus, a cloud layer originally consisting mainly of undercooled water with few ice crystals is transformed into an ice cloud. The development of the anvil shape at the top of a towering cumulonimbus cloud shows this transformation very clearly. The larger ice particles overcome more readily the rising tendency of the air in the cloud. Falling into lower levels they grow, aggregating with other crystals and possibly with waterdrops, melt, and form raindrops when near-surface temperatures permit.HailSolid precipitation in the form of hard pellets of ice that fall from cumulonimbus clouds is called hail. It is convenient to distinguish between three types of hail particles.The first is soft hail, or snow pellets, which are white opaque rounded or conical pellets as large as 6 mm (0.2 inch) in diameter. They are composed of small cloud droplets frozen together, have a low density, and are readily crushed.The second is small hail (ice grains or pellets), which are transparent or translucent pellets of ice that are spherical, spheroidal, conical, or irregular in shape, with diameters of a few millimeters. They may consist of frozen raindrops, of largely melted and refrozen snowflakes, or of snow pellets encased in a thin layer of solid ice.True hailstones, the third type, are hard pellets of ice, larger than 5 mm (0.2 inch) in diameter, that may be spherical, spheroidal, conical, discoidal, or irregular in shape and often have a structure of concentric layers of alternately clear and opaque ice. A moderately severe storm may produce stones a few centimeters in diameter, whereas a very severe storm may release stones with a maximum diameter of 10 cm (4 inches) or more. Large damaging hail falls most frequently in the continental areas of middle latitudes (e.g., in the Nebraska-Wyoming-Colorado area of the United States, in South Africa, and in northern India) but is rare in equatorial regions. Terminal velocities of hailstones range from about 5 meters (16 feet) per second for the smallest stones to perhaps 40 meters (130 feet) per second for stones 5 cm (2 inches) in diameter.World distribution of precipitationRegional and latitudinal distributionThe yearly precipitation averaged over the whole Earth is about 100 cm (39 inches), but this is distributed very unevenly. The regions of highest rainfall are found in the equatorial zone and the monsoon area of Southeast Asia. Middle latitudes receive moderate amounts of precipitation, but little falls in the desert regions of the subtropics and around the poles.If Earth's surface were perfectly uniform, the long-term average rainfall would be distributed in distinct latitudinal bands, but the situation is complicated by the pattern of the global winds, the distribution of land and sea, and the presence of mountains. Because rainfall results from the ascent and cooling of moist air, the areas of heavy rain indicate regions of rising air, whereas the deserts occur in regions in which the air is warmed and dried during descent. In the subtropics, the trade winds bring plentiful rain to the east coasts of the continents, but the west coasts tend to be dry. On the other hand, in high latitudes the west coasts are generally wetter than the east coasts. Rain tends to be abundant on the windward slopes of mountain ranges but sparse on the lee sides.In the equatorial belt, the trade winds from both hemispheres converge and give rise to a general upward motion of air, which becomes intensified locally in tropical storms that produce very heavy rains in the Caribbean, the Indian and southwest Pacific oceans, and the China Sea and in thunderstorms that are especially frequent and active over the land areas. During the annual cycle, the doldrums move toward the summer hemisphere, so outside a central region near the Equator, which has abundant rain at all seasons, there is a zone that receives much rain in summer but a good deal less in winter.The dry areas of the subtropics such as the desert regions of North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, South Africa, Australia, and central South America are due to the presence of semipermanent subtropical anticyclones in which the air subsides and becomes warm and dry. These high-pressure belts tend to migrate with the seasons and cause summer dryness on the poleward side and winter dryness on the equatorward side of their mean positions (see below Cyclones and anticyclones). The easterly trade winds, having made a long passage over the warm oceans, bring plentiful rains to the east coasts of the subtropical landmasses, but the west coasts and the interiors of the continents, which are often sheltered by mountain ranges, are very dry.In middle latitudes, weather and rainfall are dominated by traveling depressions and fronts that yield a good deal of rain in all seasons and in most places except the far interiors of the Asian and North American continents. Generally, rainfall is more abundant in summer, except on the western coasts of North America, Europe, and North Africa, where it is higher during the winter.At high latitudes and especially in the polar regions, the low precipitation is caused partly by subsidence of air in the high-pressure belts and partly by the low temperatures. Snow or rain occur at times, but evaporation from the cold sea and land surfaces is slow, and the cold air has little capacity for moisture.The influence of oceans and continents on rainfall is particularly striking in the case of the Indian monsoon. During the Northern Hemisphere winter, cool dry air from the interior of the continent flows southward and produces little rain over the land areas. After the air has traveled some distance over the warm tropical ocean, however, it releases heavy shower rains over the East Indies. During the northern summer, when the monsoon blows from the southwest, rainfall is heavy over India and Southeast Asia. These rains are intensified where the air is forced to ascend over the windward slopes of the Western Ghats and the Himalayas.The combined effects of land, sea, mountains, and prevailing winds show up in South America. There the desert in southern Argentina is sheltered by the Andes from the westerly winds blowing from the Pacific Ocean, and the west-coast desert not only is situated under the South Pacific subtropical anticyclone but is also protected by the Andes against rain-bearing winds from the Atlantic.Amounts and variabilityThe long-term average amounts of precipitation for a season or a year give little information on the regularity with which rain may be expected, particularly for regions where the average amounts are small. For example, at Iquique, a city in northern Chile, four years once passed without rain, whereas the fifth year gave 15 mm (0.6 inch); the five-year average was therefore 3 mm (0.1 inch). Clearly, such averages are of little practical value, and the frequency distribution or the variability of precipitation also must be known.The variability of the annual rainfall is closely related to the average amounts. For example, over the British Isles, which have a very dependable rainfall, the annual amount varies by less than 10 percent above the long-term average value. A variability of less than 15 percent is typical of the mid-latitude cyclonic belts of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and of much of the wet equatorial regions. In the interiors of the desert areas of Africa, Arabia, and Central Asia, however, the rainfall in a particular year may deviate from the normal long-term average by more than 40 percent. The variability for individual seasons or months may differ considerably from that for the year as a whole, but again the variability tends to be higher where the average amounts are low.The heaviest annual rainfall in the world was recorded at the village of Cherrapunji, India, where 26,470 mm (1,042 inches) fell between August 1860 and July 1861. The heaviest rainfall in a period of 24 hours was 1,870 mm (74 inches), recorded at the village of Cilaos, R�union, in the Indian Ocean on March 15-16, 1952. The lowest recorded rainfall in the world occurred at Arica, a port city in northern Chile. An annual average, taken over a 43-year period, was only 0.5 mm (0.02 inch).Although past records give some guide, it is not possible to estimate very precisely the maximum possible precipitation that may fall in a given locality during a specified interval of time. Much will depend on a favorable combination of several factors, including the properties of the storm and the effects of local topography. Thus, it is possible only to make estimates that are based on analyses of past storms or on theoretical calculations that attempt to maximize statistically the various factors or the most effective combination of factors that are known to control the duration and intensity of the precipitation. For many important planning and design problems, however, estimates of the greatest precipitation to be expected at a given location within a specified number of years are required.In the designing of a dam, the highest 24-hour rainfall to be expected once in 30 years over the whole catchment area might be relevant. For dealing with such problems, a great deal of work has been devoted to determining from past records the frequency with which rainfalls of given intensity and total amount may be expected to reoccur at particular locations and also to determining the statistics of rainfall for a specific area from measurements made at only a few points.Effects of precipitationRaindrop impact and soil erosionLarge raindrops, up to 6 mm (0.2 inch) in diameter, have terminal velocities of about 10 meters (30 feet) per second and so may cause considerable compaction and erosion of the soil by their force of impact. The formation of a compacted crust makes it more difficult for air and water to reach the roots of plants and encourages the water to run off the surface and carry away the topsoil with it. In hilly and mountainous areas, heavy rain may turn the soil into mud and slurry, which may produce enormous erosion by mudflow generation. Rainwater running off hard impervious surfaces or waterlogged soil may cause local flooding.Surface runoffThe rainwater that is not evaporated or stored in the soil eventually runs off the surface and finds its way into rivers, streams, and lakes or percolates through the rocks and becomes stored in natural underground reservoirs. A given catchment area must achieve an overall balance such that precipitation (P) less evaporation of moisture from the surface (E) will equal storage in the ground (S) and runoff (R). This may be expressed: P - E = S + R. The runoff may be determined by measuring the flow of water in the rivers with stream gauges, and the precipitation may be measured by a network of rain gauges, but storage and evaporation are more difficult to estimate.Of all the water that falls on Earth's surface, the relative amounts that run off, evaporate, or seep into the ground vary so much for different areas that no firm figures can be given for Earth as a whole. It has been estimated, however, that in the United States 10 to 50 percent of the rainfall runs off at once, 10 to 30 percent evaporates, and 40 to 60 percent is absorbed by the soil. Of the entire rainfall, 15 to 30 percent is estimated to be used by plants, either to form plant tissue or in transpiration.Atmospheric pressure and windAtmospheric pressureAtmospheric pressure and wind are both significant controlling factors of Earth's weather and climate. Although these two physical variables may at first glance appear to be quite different, they are in fact closely related. Wind exists because of horizontal and vertical differences (gradients) in pressure, yielding a correspondence that often makes it possible to use the pressure distribution as an alternative representation of atmospheric motions. Pressure is the force exerted on a unit area, and atmospheric pressure is equivalent to the weight of air above a given area on Earth's surface or within its atmosphere. This pressure is usually expressed in millibars (mb; 1 mb equals 1,000 dynes per square cm) or in kilopascals (kPa; 1 kPa equals 10,000 dynes per square cm). Distributions of pressure on a map are depicted by a series of curved lines called isobars, each of which connects points of equal pressure.At sea level the mean pressure is about 1,000 mb (100 kPa), varying by less than 5 percent from this value at any given location or time. Mean sea-level pressure values for the mid-winter months in the Northern Hemisphere are summarized in this first diagram, and mean sea-level pressure values for the mid-summer months are illustrated in the next diagram. Since charts of atmospheric pressure often represent average values over several days, pressure features that are relatively consistent day after day emerge, while more transient, short-lived features are removed. Those that remain are known as semipermanent pressure centers and are the source regions for major, relatively uniform bodies of air known as air masses. Warm, moist maritime tropical (mT) air forms over tropical and subtropical ocean waters in association with the high-pressure regions prominent there. Cool, moist maritime polar (mP) air, on the other hand, forms over the colder subpolar ocean waters just south and east of the large, winter oceanic low-pressure regions. Over the continents, cold dry continental polar (cP) air and extremely cold dry continental arctic (cA) air forms in the high-pressure regions that are especially pronounced in winter, while hot dry continental tropical (cT) air forms over hot desertlike continental domains in summer in association with low-pressure areas, which are sometimes called heat lows.A closer examination of the diagrams above reveals some interesting features. First, it is clear that sea-level pressure is dominated by closed high- and low-pressure centers, which are largely caused by differential surface heating between low and high latitudes and between continental and oceanic regions. High pressure tends to be amplified over the colder surface features. Second, because of seasonal changes in surface heating, the pressure centers exhibit seasonal changes in their characteristics. For example, the Siberian High, Aleutian Low, and Icelandic Low that are so prominent in the winter virtually disappear in summer as the continental regions warm relative to surrounding bodies of water. At the same time, the Pacific and Atlantic highs amplify and migrate northward.At altitudes well above Earth's surface, the monthly average pressure distributions show much less tendency to form in closed centers but rather appear as quasi-concentric circles around the poles. This more symmetrical appearance reflects the dominant role of meridional (north-south) differences in radiative heating and cooling. Excess heating in tropical latitudes, in contrast to polar areas, produces higher pressure at upper levels in the tropics as thunderstorms transfer air to higher levels. In addition, the greater heating/cooling contrast in winter yields stronger pressure differences during this season. Perfect symmetry between the tropics and the poles is interrupted by wavelike atmospheric disturbances associated with migratory and semipermanent high- and low-pressure surface weather systems. These weather systems are most pronounced over the Northern Hemisphere, with its more prominent land-ocean contrasts and orographic (high-elevation) features.WindRelationship of wind to pressure and governing forcesThe changing wind patterns are governed by Newton's second law of motion, which states that the sum of the forces acting on a body equals the product of the mass of that body and the acceleration caused by those forces. The basic relationship between atmospheric pressure and horizontal wind is revealed by disregarding friction and any changes in wind direction and speed to yield the mathematical relationshipwhere u is the zonal wind speed (+ eastward), v the meridional wind speed (+ northward), f = 2w sin f (Coriolis parameter), w the angular velocity of Earth's rotation, f the latitude, r the air density (mass per unit volume), p the pressure, and x and y the distances toward the east and north, respectively. This simple non-accelerating flow is known as geostrophic balance and yields a motion field known as the geostrophic wind. Equation (1) expresses, for both the x and y directions, a balance between the force created by horizontal differences in pressure (the horizontal pressure-gradient force) and an apparent force that results from Earth's rotation (the Coriolis force). The pressure-gradient force expresses the tendency of pressure differences to effectuate air movement from higher to lower pressure. The Coriolis force arises because the air motions are observed on a rotating nearly spherical body. The total motion of a parcel of air has two parts: (1) the motion relative to Earth as if the planet were fixed, and (2) the motion given to the parcel of air by the planet's rotation. When the atmosphere is viewed from a fixed point in space, Earth's rotation is apparent. An observer in space would witness the total motion of the atmosphere. Conversely, an observer on the ground sees and measures only the relative motion of the atmosphere, because he is also rotating and cannot see directly the rotational motion applied by Earth. Instead, the observer on the ground sees the effect of the rotation as a deviation applied to the relative motion. The quantity that describes this deviation is the Coriolis force. Because the Coriolis force results from a ground-level frame of reference on a rotating planet, it is not a true force.More specifically, the observer on the ground experiences the Coriolis force as a deflection of the relative motion to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. Of particular significance in this simple model of wind-pressure relationships is the fact that the geostrophic wind blows in a direction parallel to the isobars, with the low pressure on the observer's left as he looks downwind in the Northern Hemisphere and on his right in the Southern Hemisphere.Wind speed increases as the distance between isobars decreases (or pressure gradient increases). Curvature (i.e., changes in wind direction) can be added to this model with relative ease in a flow representation known as the gradient wind. The basic wind-pressure relationships, however, remain qualitatively the same. Of greatest importance is the fact that large-scale, observed winds tend to behave much as the geostrophic- or gradient-flow models predict in most of the atmosphere. The most notable exceptions occur in low latitudes, where the Coriolis parameter becomes very small equation (1) cannot be used to provide a reliable wind estimate and in the lowest kilometer of the atmosphere, where friction becomes important. The friction induced by airflow over the underlying surface reduces the wind speed and alters the simple balance of forces such that the wind blows with a component toward lower pressure.Cyclones and anticyclonesCyclones and anticyclones are regions of relatively low and high pressure, respectively. They occur over most of Earth's surface in a variety of sizes ranging from the very large semipermanent examples described above to smaller, highly mobile systems. The latter are the focus of discussion in this section.Common to both cyclones and anticyclones are the characteristic circulation patterns. The geostrophic-wind and gradient-wind models dictate that, in the Northern Hemisphere, flow around a cyclone cyclonic circulation is counterclockwise, and flow around an anticyclone anticyclonic circulation is clockwise. Circulation directions are reversed in the Southern Hemisphere (see above the diagrams of mean sea-level pressure). In the presence of friction, the superimposed component of motion toward lower pressure produces a spiraling  effect toward the low-pressure centre and away from the high-pressure centre.The cyclones that form outside the equatorial belt, known as extratropical cyclones, may be regarded as large eddies in the broad air currents that flow in the general direction from west to east around the middle and higher latitudes of both hemispheres (see below). They are an essential part of the mechanism by which the excess heat received from the Sun in Earth's equatorial belt is conveyed toward higher latitudes. These higher latitudes radiate more heat to space than they receive from the Sun, and heat must reach them by winds from the lower latitudes if their temperature is to be continually cool rather than cold. If there were no cyclones and anticyclones, the north-south movements of the air would be much more limited, and there would be little opportunity for heat to be carried poleward by winds of subtropical origin. Under such circumstances the temperature of the lower latitudes would increase, and the polar regions would cool; the temperature gradient between them would intensify.Strong horizontal gradients of temperature are particularly favorable for the formation and development of cyclones. The temperature difference between polar regions and the Equator builds up until it becomes sufficiently intense to generate new cyclones. As their associated cold fronts sweep equatorward and their warm fronts move poleward, the new cyclones reduce the temperature difference. Thus, the wind circulation on Earth represents a balance between the heating effects of solar radiation occurring in the polar regions and at the Equator. Wind circulation, through the effect of cyclones, anticyclones, and other wind systems, also periodically destroys this temperature contrast.Cyclones of a somewhat different character occur closer to the Equator, generally forming in latitudes between 10� to 30� N and S over the oceans. They generally are known as tropical cyclones when their winds equal or exceed 74 miles (119 km) per hour. They are also known as hurricanes if they occur in the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, as typhoons in the western Pacific Ocean and the China Sea, and as cyclones off the coasts of Australia. These storms are of smaller diameter than the extratropical cyclones, ranging from 100 to 500 km (60 to 300 miles) in diameter, and are accompanied by winds that sometimes reach extreme violence. These storms are more fully described in the article tropical cyclone.Extratropical cyclonesOf the two types of large-scale cyclones, extratropical cyclones are the most abundant and exert influence on the broadest scale; they affect the largest percentage of Earth's surface. Furthermore, this class of cyclones is the principal cause of day-to-day weather changes experienced in middle and high latitudes and thus is the focal point of much of modern weather forecasting. The seeds for many current ideas concerning extratropical cyclones were sown between 1912 and 1930 by a group of Scandinavian meteorologists working in Bergen, Nor. This so-called Bergen school, founded by Norwegian meteorologist and physicist Vilhelm Bjerknes, formulated a model for a cyclone that forms as a disturbance along a zone of strong temperature contrast known as a front, which in turn constitutes a boundary between two contrasting air masses. In this model the masses of polar and mid-latitude air around the globe are separated by the polar front (the transition region separating warmer tropical air from colder polar air). This region possesses a strong temperature gradient, and thus it is a reservoir of potential energy that can be readily tapped and converted into the kinetic energy associated with extratropical cyclones.For this reservoir to be tapped, a cyclone (called a wave, or frontal, cyclone) must develop much in the way shown in the diagram. The feature that is of primary importance prior to cyclone development (cyclogenesis) is a front, represented in the initial stage (A) as a heavy black line with alternating triangles or semicircles attached to it. This stationary or very slow-moving front forms a boundary between cold and warm air and thus is a zone of strong horizontal temperature gradient (sometimes referred to as a baroclinic zone). Cyclone development is initiated as a disturbance along the front, which distorts the front into the wavelike configuration (B; wave appearance). As the pressure within the disturbance continues to decrease, the disturbance assumes the appearance of a cyclone and forces poleward and equatorward movements of warm and cold air, respectively, which are represented by mobile frontal boundaries. As depicted in the cyclonic circulation stage (C), the front that signals the advancing cold air (cold front) is indicated by the triangles, while the front corresponding to the advancing warm air (warm front) is indicated by the semicircles. As the cyclone continues to intensify, the cold dense air streams rapidly equatorward, yielding a cold front with a typical slope of 1 to 50 and a propagation speed that is often 8 to 15 meters per second (about 18 to 34 miles per hour) or more. At the same time, the warm less-dense air moving in a northerly direction flows up over the cold air east of the cyclone to produce a warm front with a typical slope of 1 to 200 and a typically much slower propagation speed of about 2.5 to 8 meters per second (6 to 18 miles per hour). This difference in propagation speeds between the two fronts allows the cold front to overtake the warm front and produce yet another, more complicated frontal structure, known as an occluded front. An occluded front (D) is represented by a line with alternating triangles and semicircles on the same side. This occlusion process may be followed by further storm intensification. The separation of the cyclone from the warm air toward the Equator, however, eventually leads to the storm's decay and dissipation (E) in a process called cyclolysis.The life cycle of such an event is typically several days, during which the cyclone may travel from several hundred to a few thousand kilometers. In its path and wake occur dramatic weather changes. A typical sequence of weather possibly resulting from the approach and passage of a cyclone and its fronts through an area is depicted in the diagram. Shown in the occluded-front stage of the cyclogenesis diagram is a cross section of the clouds and precipitation that usually occur along line ab. Warm frontal weather is most frequently characterized by stratiform clouds, which ascend as the front approaches and potentially yield rain or snow. The passing of a warm front brings a rise in air temperature and clearing skies. The warmer air, however, may also harbour the ingredients for rain shower or thunderstorm formation, a condition that is enhanced as the cold front approaches.The passage of the cold front is marked by the influx of colder air, the formation of stratocumulus clouds with some lingering rain or snow showers, and then eventual clearing. While this is an oft-repeated scenario, it is important to recognize that many other weather sequences can also occur. For example, the stratiform clouds of a warm front may have imbedded cumulus formations and thunderstorms; the warm sector might be quite dry and yield few or no clouds; the pre-cold-front weather may closely resemble that found ahead of the warm front; or the post-cold-front air may be completely cloud-free. Cloud patterns oriented along fronts and spiraling around the cyclone vortex are consistently revealed in satellite pictures of Earth.The actual formation of any area of low pressure requires that mass in the column of air lying above Earth's surface be reduced. This loss of mass then reduces the surface pressure. In the late 1930s and early '40s, three members of the Bergen school Norwegian American meteorologists Jacob Bjerknes and Jorgen Holmboe and Swedish American meteorologist Carl-Gustaf Rossby recognized that transient surface disturbances were accompanied by complementary wave features in the flow in the middle and higher atmospheric layers associated with the jet stream. These wave features are accompanied by regions of mass divergence and convergence that support the growth of surface-pressure fields and direct their movement.While extratropical cyclones form and intensify in association with fronts, there are small-scale cyclones that appear in the middle of a single air mass. A notable example is a class of cyclones, generally smaller than the frontal variety, that form in polar air streams in the wake of a frontal cyclone. These so-called polar lows are most prominent in subpolar marine environments and are thought to be caused by the transfer of heat and moisture from the warmer water surface into the overlying polar air and by supporting middle-tropospheric circulation features. Other small-scale cyclones form on the lee side of mountain barriers as the general westerly flow is disturbed by the mountain. These lee cyclones  may produce major windstorms and dust storms downstream of a mountain barrier.AnticyclonesWhile cyclones are typically regions of inclement weather, anticyclones are usually meteorologically quiet regions. Generally larger than cyclones, anticyclones exhibit persistent downward motions and yield dry stable air that may extend horizontally many hundreds of kilometers.In most cases, an actively developing anticyclone forms over a ground location in the region of cold air behind a cyclone as it moves away. This anticyclone forms before the next cyclone advances into the area. Such an anticyclone is known as a cold anticyclone. A result of the downward air motion in an anticyclone, however, is compression of the descending air. As a consequence of this compression, the air is warmed. Thus, after a few days, the air composing the anticyclone at levels 2 to 5 km (1 to 3 miles) above the ground tends to increase in temperature, and the anticyclone is transformed into a warm anticyclone.Warm anticyclones move slowly, and cyclones are diverted around their periphery. During their transformation from cold to warm status, anticyclones usually move out of the main belt followed by cyclones in middle latitudes and often amalgamate with the quasi-permanent bands of relatively high pressure found in both hemispheres around latitude 20� to 30� the so-called subtropical anticyclones. On some occasions the warm anticyclones remain in the belt normally occupied by the mid-latitude westerly winds. The normal cyclone tracks are then considerably modified; atmospheric depressions (areas of low pressure) are either blocked in their eastward progress or diverted to the north or south of the anticyclone. Anticyclones that interrupt the normal circulation of the westerly wind in this way are called blocking anticyclones, or blocking highs. They frequently persist for a week or more, and the occurrence of a few such blocking anticyclones may dominate the character of a season. Blocking anticyclones are particularly common over Europe, the eastern Atlantic, and the Alaskan area.The descent and warming of the air in an anticyclone might be expected to lead to the dissolution of clouds and the absence of rain. Near the centre of the anticyclone, the winds are light and the air can become stagnant. Air pollution can build up as a result. The city of Los Angeles, for example, often has poor air quality because it is frequently under a stationary anticyclone. In winter the ground cools, and the lower layers of the atmosphere also become cold. Fog may be formed as the air is cooled to its dew point in the stagnant air. Under other circumstances, the air trapped in the first kilometer above Earth's surface may pick up moisture from the sea or other moist surfaces, and layers of cloud may form in areas near the ground up to a height of about 1 km (0.6 mile). Such layers of cloud can be persistent in anticyclones (except over the continents in summer), but they rarely grow thick enough to produce rain. If precipitation occurs, it is usually drizzle or light snow.Anticyclones are often regions of clear skies and sunny weather in summer; at other times of the year, cloudy and foggy weather especially over wet ground, snow cover, and the ocean may be more typical. Winter anticyclones produce colder than average temperatures at the surface, particularly if the skies remain clear. Anticyclones are responsible for periods of little or no rain, and such periods may be prolonged in association with blocking highs.Cyclone and anticyclone climatologyMigrating cyclones and anticyclones tend to be distributed around certain preferred regions, known as tracks, that emanate from preferred cyclogenetic and anticyclogenetic regions. Favoured cyclogenetic regions in the Northern Hemisphere are found on the lee side of mountains and off the east coasts of continents. Cyclones then track east or southeast before eventually turning toward the northeast and decaying. The tracks are displaced farther northward in July, reflecting the more northward position of the polar front in summer. Continental cyclones usually intensify at a rate of 0.5 mb (0.05 kPa) per hour or less, although more dramatic examples can be found. Marine cyclones, on the other hand, often experience explosive development in excess of 1 mb (0.1 kPa) per hour, particularly in winter.Anticyclones tend to migrate equatorward out of the cold air mass regions and then eastward before decaying or merging with a warm anticyclone. Like cyclones, warm anticyclones also slowly migrate poleward with the warm season.In the Southern Hemisphere, where most of Earth's surface is covered by oceans, the cyclones are distributed fairly uniformly through the various longitudes. Typically, cyclones form initially in latitudes 30� to 40� S and move in a generally southeastward direction, reaching maturity in latitudes near 60� S. Thus, the Antarctic continent is usually ringed by a number of mature or decaying cyclones. The belt of ocean from 40� to 60� S is a region of persistent, strong westerly winds that form part of the circulation to the north of the main cyclone centers; These are the roaring forties, where the westerly winds are interrupted only at intervals by the passage southeastward of developing cyclones.Local windsScale classesOrganized wind systems occur in spatial dimensions ranging from tens of meters to thousands of kilometers and possess residence times that vary from seconds to weeks. The concept of scale considers the typical size and lifetime of a phenomenon. Since the atmosphere exhibits such a large variety of both spatial and temporal scales, efforts have been made to group various phenomena into scale classes. The class describing the largest and longest-lived of these phenomena is known as the planetary scale. Such phenomena are typically a few thousand kilometers in size and have lifetimes ranging from several days to several weeks. Examples of planetary-scale phenomena include the semipermanent pressure centers discussed above and certain globe-encircling upper-air waves (see below Upper-air waves).A second class is known as the synoptic scale. Spanning smaller distances, a few hundred to a few thousand kilometers, and possessing shorter lifetimes, a few to several days, this class contains the migrating cyclones and anticyclones that control day-to-day weather changes. Sometimes the planetary and synoptic scales are combined into a single classification termed the large-scale, or macroscale. Large-scale wind systems are distinguished by the predominance of horizontal motions over vertical motions and by the preeminent importance of the Coriolis force in influencing wind characteristics. Examples of large-scale wind systems include the trade winds and the westerlies.There is a third class of phenomena of even smaller size and shorter lifetime. In this class, vertical motions may be as significant as horizontal movement, and the Coriolis force often plays a less important role. Known as the mesoscale, this class is characterized by spatial dimensions of ten to a few hundred kilometers and lifetimes of a day or less. Because of the shorter time scale and because the other forces may be much larger, the effect of the Coriolis force in mesoscale phenomena is sometimes neglected.Two of the best-known examples of mesoscale phenomena are the thunderstorm and its devastating by-product, the tornado (see thunderstorm; tornado). The present discussion focuses on less intense, though nevertheless commonly observed, wind systems that are found in rather specific geographic locations and thus are often referred to as local wind systems.Local wind systemsThe so-called sea and land breeze circulation is a local wind system typically encountered along coastlines adjacent to large bodies of water and is induced by differences that occur between the heating or cooling of the water surface and the adjacent land surface. Water has a higher heat capacity (i.e., more units of heat are required to produce a given temperature change in a volume of water) than do the materials in the land surface. Daytime solar radiation penetrates to several meters into the water, the water vertically mixes, and the volume is slowly heated. In contrast, daytime solar radiation heats the land surface more quickly because it does not penetrate more than a few centimeters below the land surface. The land surface, now at a higher temperature relative to the air adjacent to it, transfers more heat to its overlying air mass and creates an area of low pressure. Thus, a circulation cell much like that depicted in the diagram is induced.It should be noted that the surface flow is from the water toward the land and thus is called a sea breeze.Since the landmass possesses a lower heat capacity than water, the land cools more rapidly at night than does the water. Consequently, at night the cooler landmass yields a cooler overlying air mass and creates a zone of relatively higher pressure. This produces a circulation cell with air motions opposite to those found during the day. This flow from land to water is known as a land breeze. The land breeze is typically shallower than the sea breeze since the cooling of the atmosphere over land is confined to a shallower layer at night than the heating of the air during the day.Sea and land breezes occur along the coastal regions of oceans or large lakes in the absence of a strong large-scale wind system during periods of strong daytime heating or nighttime cooling. Those who live within 10 to 20 km (6 to 12 miles) of the coastline often experience the cooler 19- to 37-km-per-hour (12- to 23-mile-per-hour) winds of the sea breeze on a sunny afternoon only to find it turn into a sultry land breeze late at night. One of the features of the sea and land breeze is a region of low-level air convergence in the termination region of the surface flow. Such convergence often induces local upward motions and cloud formations. Thus, in sea and land breeze regions, it is not uncommon to see clouds lying off the coast at night; these clouds are then dissipated by the daytime sea breeze, which forms new clouds, perhaps with showers occurring over land in the afternoon.Another group of local winds is induced by the presence of mountain and valley features on Earth's surface. One subset of such winds, known as mountain winds or breezes, is induced by differential heating or cooling along mountain slopes. During the day, solar heating of the sunlit slopes causes the overlying air to move upslope. These winds are also called anabatic flow. At night, as the slopes cool, the direction of airflow is reversed, and cool downslope drainage motion occurs. Such winds may be relatively gentle or may occur in strong gusts, depending on the topographic configuration. These winds are one type of katabatic flow. In an enclosed valley, the cool air that drains into the valley may give rise to a thick fog condition. Fog persists until daytime heating reverses the circulation and creates clouds associated with the upslope motion at the mountain top.Another subset of katabatic flow, called foehn winds (also known as chinook winds east of the Rocky Mountains and as Santa Ana winds in southern California), is induced by adiabatic temperature changes occurring as air flows over a mountain. Adiabatic temperature changes are those that occur without the addition or subtraction of heat; they occur in the atmosphere when bundles of air are moved vertically. When air is lifted, it enters a region of lower pressure and expands. This expansion is accompanied by a reduction of temperature (adiabatic cooling). When air subsides, it contracts and experiences adiabatic warming. As air ascends on the windward side of the mountain, its cooling rate may be moderated by heat that is released during the formation of precipitation. However, having lost much of its moisture, the descending air on the leeward side of the mountain adiabatically warms faster than it was cooled on the windward ascent. Thus, the effect of this wind, if it reaches the surface, is to produce warm, dry conditions. Usually, such winds are gentle and produce a slow warming. On occasion, however, foehn winds may exceed 185 kilometers (115 miles) per hour and produce air-temperature increases of tens of degrees (sometimes more than 20 �C [36 �F]) within only a few hours.Other types of katabatic wind can occur when the underlying geography is characterized by a cold plateau adjacent to a relatively warm region of lower elevation. Such conditions are satisfied in areas in which major ice sheets or cold elevated land surfaces border warmer large bodies of water. Air over the cold plateau cools and forms a large dome of cold dense air. Unless held back by background wind conditions, this cold air will spill over into the lower elevations with speeds that vary from gentle (a few kilometers per hour) to intense (93 to 185 km [58 to 115 miles] per hour), depending on the incline of the slope of the terrain and the distribution of the background pressure field. Two special varieties of katabatic wind are well known in Europe. One is the bora, which blows from the highlands of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the Adriatic Sea; the other is the mistral, which blows out of central and southern France to the Mediterranean Sea. Creating blizzard conditions, intense katabatic winds often blow northward off the Antarctic Ice Sheet.Zonal surface windsThe diagrams of January and July mean sea-level pressure reveal that, on the average, certain geographic locations can expect to experience winds that emanate from one prevailing direction largely dictated by the presence of major semipermanent pressure systems. Such prevailing winds have long been known in marine environments because of their influence on the great sailing ships.Tropical and subtropical regions are characterized by a general band of low pressure lying near the Equator. This band is bounded by centers of high pressure that may extend poleward into the middle latitudes. Between these low- and high-pressure regions is the region of the tropical winds. Of these the most extensive are the trade winds. So named because of their favorable influence on trade ships traveling across the subtropical North Atlantic, trade winds flow westward and somewhat in the direction of the Equator on the equatorward side of the subtropical high-pressure centers. The root of the trades, occurring on the eastern side of a subtropical high-pressure centre, is characterized by subsiding air. This produces the very warm, dry conditions above a shallow layer of oceanic stratus clouds found in the eastern extremes of the subtropical Atlantic and Pacific ocean basins. As the trade winds progress westward, however, subsidence abates, the air mass becomes more humid, and scattered showers appear. These showers occur particularly on islands with elevated terrain features that interrupt the flow of the warm moist air. The equatorward flow of the trade winds of the Northern and Southern hemispheres often results in a convergence of the two air streams in a region known as the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Deep convective clouds, showers, and thunderstorms occur along the ITCZ.When the air reaches the western extreme of the high-pressure centre, it turns poleward and then eventually returns eastward in the middle latitudes. The poleward-moving air is now warm and laden with moist maritime tropical air (mT); it gives rise to the warm, humid, showery climate characteristic of the Caribbean region, eastern South America, and the western Pacific island chains. The westerlies are associated with the changeable weather common to the middle latitudes. Migrating extratropical cyclones and anticyclones associated with contrasting warm moist air moving poleward from the tropics and cold dry air moving equatorward from polar latitudes yield periods of rain (sometimes with violent thunderstorms), snow, sleet, or freezing rain interrupted by periods of dry, sunny, and sometimes bitterly cold conditions. Furthermore, these patterns are seasonally dependent, with more intense cyclones and colder air prevailing in winter but with a higher incidence of thunderstorms common in spring and summer. In addition, these migrations and the associated climate are complicated by the presence of landmasses and major mountain features, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere.The westerlies lie on the equatorward side of the semipermanent subpolar centers of low pressure. Poleward of these centers, the surface winds turn westward again over significant portions of the subpolar latitudes. As in the middle latitudes, the presence of major landmasses, notably in the Northern Hemisphere, results in significant variations in these polar easterlies. In addition, the wind systems and the associated climate are seasonally dependent. During the short summer season, the wind systems of the polar latitudes are greatly weakened. During the long winter months, these systems strengthen, and periods of snow alternate with long intervals of dry cold air characteristic of continental polar or continental arctic air masses.These major regions of surface circulation and their associated pressure fields are related to mean meridional (north-south) circulation patterns as well (see the diagram). Although their presence is discernible in long-term mean statistics accumulated over a hemisphere, such cells are often difficult to detect on a daily basis at any given longitude.As shown in the January and July maps of sea-level atmospheric pressure, particularly strong seasonal pressure variations occur over continents. Such seasonal fluctuations, commonly called monsoons, are more pronounced over land surfaces because these surfaces are subject to more significant seasonal temperature variations than water bodies. Since land surfaces both warm and cool faster than water bodies, they often quickly modify the temperature and density characteristics of air parcels passing over them.Monsoons blow for approximately six months from the northeast and six months from the southwest, principally in South Asia and parts of Africa. Summer monsoons have a dominant westerly component and a strong tendency to converge, rise, and produce rain. Winter monsoons have a dominant easterly component and a strong tendency to diverge, subside, and cause drought. Both are the result of differences in annual temperature trends over land and sea.The Indian monsoonCharacteristicsAt the Equator the area near India is unique in that dominant or frequent westerly winds occur at the surface almost constantly throughout the year; the surface easterlies reach only to latitudes near 20� N in February, and even then they have a very strong northerly component. They soon retreat northward, and drastic changes take place in the upper-air circulation (see Jet streams). This is a time of transition between the end of one monsoon and the beginning of the next. Late in March, the high-sun season reaches the Equator and moves farther north. With it go atmospheric instability, convectional (that is, rising and turbulent) clouds, and rain. The westerly subtropical jet stream still controls the flow of air across northern India, and the surface winds are northeasterlies.As the high-sun season moves northward during April, India becomes particularly prone to rapid heating because the highlands to the north protect it from any incursions of cold air. There are three distinct areas of relative upper tropospheric warmth namely, (1) above the southern Bay of Bengal, (2) above the Plateau of Tibet, and (3) across the trunks of the various peninsulas that are relatively dry during this time. These three areas combine to form a vast heat-source region. The relatively warm area above the southern Bay of Bengal occurs mostly at the 500-100-millibar level. (This atmospheric pressure region typically occurs at elevations between 18,000 and 53,000 feet but may vary according to changes in heating and cooling.) It does not appear at a lower level and is probably caused by the release of condensation heat (associated with the change from water vapor to liquid water) at the top of towering cumulonimbus clouds along the advancing intertropical convergence. In contrast, a heat sink appears over the southern Indian Ocean as the relatively cloud-free air cools by emitting long-wavelength radiation. Monsoon winds at the surface blow from heat sink to heat source. As a result, by May the southwest monsoon is well-established over Sri Lanka, an island off the southeastern tip of the Indian peninsula.Also in May, the dry surface of Tibet (above 4,000 meters [13,100 feet]) absorbs and radiates heat that is readily transmitted to the air immediately above. At about 6,000 meters (19,700 feet) an anticyclonic cell arises, causing a strong easterly flow in the upper troposphere above northern India. The subtropical jet stream suddenly changes its course to the north of the anticyclonic ridge and the highlands, though it may occasionally reappear southward of them for very brief periods. This change of the upper tropospheric circulation above northern India from westerly jet to easterly flow coincides with a reversal of the vertical temperature and pressure gradients between 600 and 300 millibars. On many occasions the easterly wind aloft assumes jet force. It anticipates by a few days the burst, or onset, of the surface southwesterly monsoon some 1,500 km (900 miles) farther south, with a definite sequential relationship, although the exact cause is not known. Because of India's inverted triangular shape, the land is heated progressively as the sun moves northward. This accelerated spread of heating, combined with the general direction of heat being transported by winds, results in a greater initial monsoonal activity over the Arabian Sea (at late springtime), where a real frontal situation often occurs, than over the Bay of Bengal. The relative humidity of coastal districts in the Indian region rises above 70 percent, and some rain occurs. Above the heated land, the air below 1,500 meters (5,000 feet) becomes unstable, but it is held down by the overriding easterly flow. This does not prevent frequent thunderstorms from occurring in late May.During June the easterly jet becomes firmly established at 150 to 100 millibars, an atmospheric pressure region typically occurring at elevations between 45,000 and 53,000 feet. It reaches its greatest speed at its normal position to the south of the anticyclonic ridge, at about 15� N from China through India.In Arabia it decelerates and descends to the middle troposphere (3,000 meters [9,800 feet]). A stratospheric belt of very cold air, analogous to the one normally found above the intertropical convergence near the Equator, occurs above the anticyclonic ridge, across southern Asia at 30�-40� N and above the 500-millibar level (6,000 meters [19,700 feet]). These upper-air features that arise so far away from the Equator are associated with the surface monsoon and are absent when there is no monsoonal flow. The position of the easterly jet controls the location of monsoonal rains, which occur ahead and to the left of the strongest winds and also behind them and to the right. The surface flow, however, is a strong, southwesterly, humid, and unstable wind that brings humidities of more than 80 percent and heavy, squally showers that are the burst of the monsoon. The overall pattern of the advance follows a frontal alignment, but local episodes may differ considerably. The amount of rain is variable from year to year and place to place.Most spectacular clouds and rain occur against the Western Ghats in India, where the early monsoonal airstream piles up against the steep slopes, then recedes, and piles up again to a greater height. Each time it pushes thicker clouds upward until wind and clouds roll over the barrier and, after a few brief spells of absorption by the dry inland air, cascade toward the interior. The windward slopes receive from 2,000 to 5,000 mm (80 to 200 inches) of rain in the monsoon season.Various factors, especially topography, combine to make up a complex regional pattern. Oceanic air flowing toward India below 6,000 meters (19,700 feet) is deflected in accordance with the Coriolis effect (see Relationship of wind to pressure and governing forces). The converging, moist oncoming stream becomes unstable over the hot land and is subject to rapid convection. Towering cumulonimbus clouds rise thousands of meters, producing violent thunderstorms and releasing latent heat in the surrounding air. As a result, the upper tropospheric warm belt migrates northwestward from the ocean to the land. The main body of air above 9,000 meters (29,500 feet) maintains a strong easterly flow.Later, in June and July, the monsoon is strong and well-established to a height of 6,000 meters (less in the far north), with occasional thickening to 9,000 meters. Weather conditions are cloudy, warm, and moist all over India. Rainfall varies between 400 and 500 mm (16 and 20 inches), but topography introduces some extraordinary differences. On the southern slopes of the Khasi Hills at only 1,300 meters (4,300 feet), where the moist airstreams are lifted and overturned, the village of Cherrapunji in Meghalaya state receives an average rainfall of 2,730 mm (107 inches) in July, with record totals of 897 mm (35 inches) in 24 hours in July 1915, more than 9,000 mm (354 inches) in July 1861, and 16,305 mm (642 inches) in the monsoon season of 1899. Over the Ganges valley the monsoon, deflected by the Himalayan barrier, becomes a southeasterly airflow. By then the upper tropospheric belt of warmth from condensation has moved above northern India, with an oblique bias. The lowest pressures prevail at the surface.It is mainly in July and August that waves of low pressure appear in the body of monsoonal air. Fully developed depressions appear once or twice per month. They travel from east to west more or less concurrently with high-level easterly waves and bursts of speed from the easterly jet, causing a local strengthening of the low-level monsoonal flow. The rainfall consequently increases and is much more evenly distributed than it was in June. Some of the deeper depressions become tropical cyclones before they reach the land, and these bring torrential rains and disastrous floods.A totally different development arises when the easterly jet moves farther north than usual. The monsoonal wind rising over the southern slopes of the Himalayas brings heavy rains and local floods. The weather over the central and southern districts, however, becomes suddenly drier and remains so for as long as the abnormal shift lasts. The opposite shift is also possible, with midlatitude upper air flowing along the south face of the Himalayas and bringing drought to the northern districts. Such dry spells are known as breaks of the monsoon. Those affecting the south of India are similar to those experienced on the Guinea Coast during extreme northward shifts of the wind belts (as later discussed in the section on the West African monsoon), whereas those affecting the north are due to an interaction of the middle and low latitudes. The southwest monsoon over the lower Indus Plain is only 500 meters (about 1,600 feet) thick and does not hold enough moisture to bring rain. On the other hand, the upper tropospheric easterlies become stronger and constitute a true easterly jet stream. Western Pakistan, Iran, and Arabia remain dry (probably because of the divergence in this jet) and thus become the new source of surface heat.By August the intensity and duration of sunshine have decreased, temperatures begin to fall, and the surge of southwesterly air diminishes spasmodically almost to a standstill in the northwest. Cherrapunji still receives over 2,000 mm (79 inches) of rainfall at this time, however. In September, dry, cool, northerly air begins to circle the west side of the highlands and spread over northwestern India. The easterly jet weakens, and the upper tropospheric easterlies move much farther south. Because the moist southwesterlies at lower levels are much weaker and variable, they are soon pushed back. The rainfall becomes extremely variable over most of the region, but showers are still frequent in the southeastern areas and over the Bay of Bengal.By early October, variable winds are very frequent everywhere. At the end of the month, the entire Indian region is covered by northerly air and the winter monsoon takes shape. The surface flow is deflected by the Coriolis force and becomes a northeasterly flow. This causes an October-December rainy season for the extreme southeast of the Deccan (including the Madras coast) and eastern Sri Lanka, which cannot be explained by topography alone because it extends well out over the sea. Tropical depressions and cyclones are important contributing factors.Most of India thus begins a sunny, dry, and dusty season. The driest period comes in November in the Punjab; December in central India, Bengal, and Assam; January in the northern Deccan; and February in the southern Deccan. Conversely, the western slopes of the Karakoram Range and Himalayas are then reached by the midlatitude frontal depressions that come from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The winter rains they receive, moderate as they are, place them clearly outside the monsoonal realm.Because crops and water supplies depend entirely on monsoonal rains, it became imperative that quantitative, long-range weather forecasts be available. Embedded in the weather patterns of other parts of the world are clues to the summer conditions in South Asia. These clues often appear in the months leading up to monsoon onset. For a forecast to be released at the beginning of June, South American pressure and Indian upper-wind data for the month of April are examined. These data, though widely separated from one another, are positively correlated and may be used as predictors of June conditions. Forecasts may be further refined in May by comparing rainfall patterns in both Zimbabwe and Java to the easterly winds above the city of Kolkata (Calcutta) in West Bengal state. In this situation the correlation between rainfall and easterly winds is negative.Air pollution and the winter monsoon in AsiaDuring the winter months in Asia, the Siberian anticyclone, which is typically centred near Lake Baikal in Russia, extends its influence over most of central and northern China. In these locations, subsiding air and strong temperature inversions prevail in the lowest kilometer of the atmosphere. Temperature inversions create regions of stagnant air that have the effect of trapping air pollution. In China, Southeast Asia, and South Asia, the widespread practice of burning firewood and coal for cooking, heating, and industry produces significant air pollution in the lower troposphere. The prevailing northeasterly winds of the winter monsoon transport the bulk of this polluted air southward, where it contributes to what has become known as the Asian Brown Cloud over the Indian Ocean.A strong reversal of winds, where northeasterly winds near Earth's surface shift to more westerly directions above 1 km (0.6 mile), is a characteristic feature of the northeast monsoon. Parcels of polluted air rising above the 1-km level are carried eastward, over the Pacific Ocean where they disperse. When these parcels are caught in the strong winds of the subtropical jet stream, they have been known to traverse half the globe in a matter of 10 to 15 days. As a result, pollution related to the winter monsoon has become widely recognized as a major scientific issue with global environmental implications.The Malaysian-Australian monsoonSoutheast Asia and northern Australia are combined in one monsoonal system that differs from others because of the peculiar and somewhat symmetrical distribution of landmasses on both sides of the Equator. In this respect, the northwest monsoon of Australia is unique. The substantial masses of water between Asia and Australia have a moderating effect on tropospheric temperatures, weakening the summer monsoon. The many islands (e.g., Philippines and Indonesia) provide an infinite variety of topographic effects. Typhoons that develop within the monsoonal air bring additional complications.It would be possible to exclude North China, Korea, and Japan from the monsoonal domain because their seasonal rhythm follows the normal midlatitude pattern a predominant outflow of cold continental air in winter and frontal depressions and rain alternating with fine, dry anticyclonic weather in the warm season. On the other hand, the seasonal reversal of wind direction in this area is almost as persistent as that in India. The winter winds of northeastern Asia are much stronger because of the relative proximity of the Siberian anticyclone. The tropical ridge of high pressure is the natural boundary between these non-monsoonal areas and the monsoonal lands farther south.The northern limit of the typical monsoon may be set at about 25� N latitude. Farther north the summer monsoon is not strong enough to overcome the effect of the traveling anticyclones normally typical of the subtropics. As a result, monsoonal rains occur in June and also in late August and September, separated by a mild anticyclonic drought in July. In South China and the Philippines the trade winds prevail in the October-April (winter) period, strengthened by the regional, often gusty, outflow of air from the stationary Siberian anticyclone. Their disappearance and replacement by opposite (southwesterly) winds in the May-September (summer) period is the essence of the monsoon. In any case, these monsoonal streams are quite shallow, about 1,500 meters (4,900 feet) in winter and 2,000 meters (about 6,600 feet) in summer. They bring rain only when subject to considerable cooling, such as anywhere along the steep, windward slopes of the Philippines and Taiwan. On the larger islands there are contrasting effects: the slopes facing west receive most of their rainfall from May to October and experience drought from December to April, whereas the slopes facing east receive orographic rains (those produced when moist air is forced to rise by topography) from September to April and mainly convectional rains from May to October.In Vietnam and Thailand the summer monsoon is more strongly developed because of the wider expanses of overheated land. The southwesterly stream flows from May to October, reaching a thickness of 4 to 5 km (about 2.5 to 3 miles); it brings plentiful, but not extraordinary, rainfall. The period from November through February is the cool, dry season, and the period from March through April is the hot, dry one; in the far south the coolness is but relative. Along the east coast and on the eastward slopes, more rain is brought by the winter monsoon. In the summer, somewhere between Thailand and Cambodia in the interior, there may be a faint line of convergence between the southwesterly Indian-Myanmar monsoon and the southeasterly Malaysian monsoon.Monsoonal winds are weak over Indonesia because of the expanses of water and the low latitude, but their seasonal reversal is definite. From April to October the Australian southeasterly air flows, whereas north of the Equator the flow becomes a southwesterly. The Malaysian-Australian monsoon generally maintains its dryness over the islands closer to Australia, but farther north it carries increasing amounts of moisture. The northeasterly flow from Asia, which becomes northwesterly south of the Equator, is laden with moisture when it reaches Indonesia, bringing cloudy and rainy weather between November and May. The wettest months are December in most of Sumatra and January elsewhere, but rainfall patterns are highly localized. In Java, for instance, at sea level alone there are two major regions: an equatorial west with no dry season and a monsoonal east with extreme drought in August and September.Because of its relatively small size and compact shape, Australia shows relatively simple monsoonal patterns. The north shore is subject to a clear-cut wind reversal between summer (November-April, northwesterly flow) and winter (May-September, southeasterly flow) but with two definite limitations: first, the northwesterly, rain-bearing monsoonal wind is often held offshore and is most likely to override the land to any depth during January and February; second, even in summer there often are prolonged spells of southeasterly trade winds issuing from traveling anticyclones, separating the brief monsoonal incursions. The Australian summer monsoon is thus typical in direction and weather type but quite imperfect in frequency and persistence. Its thickness is usually less than 1,500 meters (4,900 feet) over the sea and 2,000-2,500 meters (6,600-8,200 feet) over the land.Much less typical are the marginal monsoonal manifestations. On the northwest coast there frequently is a northwesterly airflow in the summer (December-March), as opposed to the winter southeasterlies, but this stream is very shallow and does not bring any rain i.e., its weather is not monsoonal even though its direction is so. On the northeast coast the onshore air is humid and brings rain, but its direction is only partly modified in summer. Most of the summer winds that arrive here occur as a northeasterly flow, although at other times the flow can be mostly southeasterly.The West African monsoonThe main characteristics of the West African seasons have been known to the scientific community for more than two centuries. The southwest winter monsoon flows as a shallow (less than 2,000 meters [about 6,600 feet]) humid layer of surface air overlain by the primary northeast trade wind, which blows from the Sahara and the Sahel as a deep stream of dry, often dusty air. As a surface northeasterly, it is generally known as the harmattan, gusty and dry in the extreme-cool at night and scorchingly hot by day. As in a thorough monsoonal development, upper tropospheric anticyclones occur at about 20� N, while the easterly jet stream may occur at about 10� N, much closer to the Equator than they are in the Indian region.The West African monsoon is the alternation of the southwesterly wind and the harmattan at the surface. Such alternation is normally found between latitudes 9� and 20� N. Northeasterlies occur constantly farther north, but only southwesterlies occur farther south. Except for erratic rains in the high-sun season, the whole year is more or less dry at 20� N. The drought becomes shorter and less complete farther south. At 12� N it lasts about half the year, and at 8� N it disappears completely. Farther south a different, lighter drought begins to appear in the high-sun months when the monsoonal southwesterly is strongest. This drought is due to the arrival of dry surface air issuing from anticyclones formed beyond the Equator in the Southern Hemisphere and is thus similar to the monsoonal drought in Java. Like the break of the monsoon in southern India, however, it occurs beyond the Equator.The moist southwesterly stream, particularly frequent between 5� and 10� N, can reach much farther north, bringing warm, humid nights and moderately hot, but still humid, days. The harmattan brings cooler nights, but the extreme daily heating causes a thermal range of 10-12 �C (18-22 �F). Even in the daytime, the harmattan may give a sensation of coolness to the human skin as it evaporates moisture from the skin's surface. The alternation of the two winds is seasonal on the basis of overall frequency, but in fact it varies considerably with the synoptic pressure patterns. The harmattan comes in spells that mostly last from a few days to more than a week.The advancing fringe of the southwest monsoon is too shallow (under 1,000 meters [3,300 feet]) for many thunderstorms and other disturbances to occur. They usually occur 200-300 km (about 125-185 miles) behind the fringe, where the moist air is deeper (1,000-2,000 meters [3,300-6,600 feet]) but the ground is still hot enough to make it very unstable. The tops of cumulonimbus clouds may reach 12,000 meters (about 39,000 feet), well above freezing level (4,200-4,500 meters [13,800-14,800 feet]). The disturbances usually occur along a given longitude line that is slightly curved and may in fact form one long line squall. They also reach 12,000 meters or more, traveling steadily westward at 37 to 56 km (23 to 35 miles) per hour. This suggests that they originate in the primary trade wind aloft and, as in India, are probably related to the tropical easterly jet stream. The southwest monsoon dominates the weather, and clouds and rain abound. The rain is primarily due to coalescence of droplets, with most of the clouds located below 3,500 meters (11,500 feet). The humidity is very high, and the daily range of temperature remains around 4 �C (7 �F).If it were not for the change in wind direction when the southeast trades have crossed the Equator, the monsoon system of West Africa could not be distinguished from the weather system, caused by the seasonal shift in the latitude of the intertropical convergence, as experienced over most of Central Africa. There is a rainy season (in this case, the monsoon season), which lasts two to three months at latitude 16� N on the west coast, three to four months at 14� N, six to seven months at 10� N, and eight months at 8� N.On the south coast, which is at latitude 4� N to 6� N, the southwest monsoon (as the intertropical convergence) may occur at any time, but the results are quite atypical for various reasons. In the low-sun season (December-February), the southwesterly is rare and ineffective, and the weather is cloudy but dry. From April to June, the midday sun is at its highest, and insolation (radiation received at Earth's surface) is most intense. Because the southwest wind occurs most frequently, the consequent building up of clouds leads to the main rainy season. During July and August (the short drought), cloudy conditions prevail, but the air issues direct from anticyclones farther south and is dry, in spite of the fact that its direction of flow does not change. Although cloudiness decreases after the second high-sun season in September and October, there is a period of occasional rains just sufficient to constitute a secondary maximum.Toward the north, conditions are more distinctly monsoonal: by latitude 8� N the two wet seasons have merged into one long wet with two subdued peaks, which last approximately seven to eight months (March-October). The dry, which is controlled by northeast winds, lasts from November to early March. There is one rainfall maximum (in August or September) only a short distance farther north, although the wet season is only a few weeks shorter.Monsoonal tendencies in Europe and North AmericaIn central Europe, where the average wind direction in summer differs some 30� to 40� from that of the Atlantic, there are monsoonal tendencies that occur not as a continuous flow but rather intermittently within frontal depressions, bringing cool, cloudy weather, rain, and thunderstorms. Some see in this climatic pattern a true monsoon, but it is obvious that it is only an embryo monsoon that results in weather singularities. The latitude is too high for a true monsoon to arise.In North America the relatively low latitude and the orientation of the land-sea boundary on the Gulf of Mexico are quite favorable to monsoonal developments. During the summer, low atmospheric pressure is frequent over the heated land; the northeasterly trade winds are consequently deflected to become easterly, southeasterly, or even southerly winds. In general, Texas and the Gulf Coast of the United States may be completely overrun by a shallow sheet of oceanic air, which may continue for a long distance inland. The rainfall regime does not reveal any marked monsoonal pattern. There are mostly two, three, or even four minor peaks in the sequence of monthly rainfall totals. In the winter there often occur northers, which are offshore winds caused by the general anticyclonic flow of air from the cold land. Neither the summer onshore wind nor the winter offshore wind is persistent enough to constitute a monsoonal sequence, even though monsoonal tendencies are quite evident.In Central America, a true monsoonal cycle occurs over a small area facing the Pacific Ocean between 5� and 12� N. Not only is there a complete seasonal reversal of the wind, but the rainfall regime is typically monsoonal. The winter period (from November to January and from March to April according to latitude and other factors) is very dry. The rainy season begins earlier (May) in the south and progressively later farther north, coming at the end of June in southern Mexico. It concludes at the end of September in the north and as late as early November in the south. The result is a rainy season that increases in duration with decreasing latitude; it lasts three months in southern Mexico and from six to seven months in Costa Rica. Latitude for latitude, this is a subdued replica of the monsoon of India.Monsoon variabilityDiurnal variabilityLandmasses in regions affected by monsoons warm up very rapidly in the afternoon hours, especially on days with cloud-free conditions; surface air temperatures between 35 and 40 �C (95 and 104 �F) are not uncommon. Under such conditions, warm air is slowly and continually steeped in the moist and cloudy environment of the monsoon. Consequently, over the course of a 24-hour period, energy from this pronounced diurnal, or daily, change in terrestrial heating is transferred to the cloud, rain, and diurnal circulation systems. The scale of this diurnal change extends from that of coastal sea breezes to continent-sized processes. Satellite observations have confirmed that the effects of rapid diurnal temperature change occur at continental scales. For example, air from surrounding areas is drawn into the lower troposphere over warmer land areas of South Asia during summer afternoon hours. This buildup of afternoon heating is accompanied by the production of clouds and rain. In contrast, a reverse circulation, characterized by suppressed clouds and rain, is noted in the early morning hours.Intra-annual variabilityMonsoon rainfall and dry spells alternate on several timescales. One such well-known timescale is found around periods of 40-50 or 30-60 days. This is called the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), named for American atmospheric scientists Roland Madden and Paul Julian in 1971. This phenomenon comes in the form of alternating cyclonic and anticyclonic regions that enhance and suppress rainfall, respectively, and flow eastward along the Equator in the Indian and Pacific oceans. The MJO has the ability to influence monsoonal circulation and rainfall by adding moisture during its cyclonic (wet) phase and reducing convection during its anticyclonic (dry) phase. At the surface in monsoon regions, both dry and wet spells result. These periods may alternate locally on the order of two or more weeks per phase.Interannual variabilityThe variability of monsoon-driven rainfall in the Indian Ocean and Australia appears to parallel El Ni�o episodes. During El Ni�o events, which occur about every two to seven years, ocean temperatures rise over the central equatorial Pacific Ocean by about 3 �C (5.4 �F). Atypical conditions characterized by increased rising air motion, convection, and rain are created in the western equatorial Pacific. At the same time, a compensating lobe of descending air, producing below-normal rainfall, appears in the vicinity of eastern Australia, Malaysia, and India. The graph illustrates a well-known El Ni�o monsoon rainfall relationship. Here, precipitation figures from above- and below-normal monsoon rainfall periods over India are expressed as a function of years. Years characterized by El Ni�o events are marked by darkened histogram barbs. The graph shows that many of the years with below-normal monsoon rainfall coincide with El Ni�o years. This illustration provides only limited guidance to seasonal forecasters since monsoon rainfall is close to normal during many El Ni�o and La Ni�a years.Many other factors, aside from equatorial Pacific Ocean surface temperatures, contribute to the interannual variability of monsoon rainfall. Excessive spring snow and ice cover on the Plateau of Tibet is related to the deficient monsoon rainfall that occurs during the following summer season in India. Furthermore, strong evidence exists that relates excessive snow and ice cover in western Siberia to deficient Asian summer rainfall. Warmer than normal sea surface temperatures over the Indian Ocean may also contribute somewhat to above-normal rainfall in South Asia. The interplay among these many factors makes forecasting monsoon strength a challenging problem for researchers.A rather clear signature on the decadal variability of Indian rainfall has been documented by the Indian Weather Service. Decadal-scale variability appears in the graph as an annual running mean that combines average rainfall anomalies (totals as a departure from normal rainfall amounts) occurring at all Indian rain gauge sites. Periods of heavier-than-normal rainfall are followed by decades of somewhat less rainfall.The flow of air around the globe is greatest in the higher altitudes, or upper levels. Upper-level airflow occurs in wavelike currents that may exist for several days before dissipating. Upper-level wind speeds generally occur on the order of tens of meters per second and vary with height. The characteristics of upper-level wind systems vary according to season and latitude and to some extent hemisphere and year. Wind speeds are strongest in the midlatitudes near the tropopause and in the mesosphere.Upper-level wind systems, like all wind systems, may be thought of as having parts consisting of uniform flow, rotational flow (with cyclonic or anticyclonic curvature), convergent or divergent flow (in which the horizontal area of masses of air shrinks or expands), and deformation (by which the horizontal area of air masses remains constant while experiencing a change in shape). Upper-level wind systems in the midlatitudes tend to have a strong component of uniform flow from west to east (westerly flow), though this flow may change during the summer. A series of cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices superimposed on the uniform west-to-east flow make up a wavetrain (a succession of waves occurring at periodic intervals). The waves are called Rossby waves after Swedish American meteorologist C.G. Rossby, who first explained fundamental aspects of their behavior in the 1930s. Waves whose wavelengths are around 6,000 km (3,700 miles) or less are called short waves, while those with longer wavelengths are called long waves. In addition, short waves progress in the same direction as the mean airflow, which is from west to east in the midlatitudes; long waves retrogress (that is, move in the opposite direction of the mean flow). Although the undulating current of air is composed of a number of waves of varying wavelength, the dominant wavelength is usually around several thousand kilometers. Near and underneath the tropopause, regions of divergence are found over regions of gently rising air at the surface, while regions of convergence aloft are found over regions of sinking air below. These regions are usually much more difficult to detect than the regions of rotational and uniform flow. While the horizontal wind speed is typically in the range of 10-50 meters per second (about 20-110 miles per hour), the vertical wind speed associated with the waves is only on the order of centimeters per second.The characteristics of upper-level wind systems are known mainly from an operational worldwide network of rawinsonde observations. (A rawinsonde is a type of radiosonde designed to track upper-level winds and whose position can be tracked by radar.) Winds measured from Doppler-radar wind profilers, aircraft navigational systems, and sequences of satellite-observed cloud imagery have also been used to augment data from the rawinsonde network; the latter two have been especially useful for defining the wind field over data-sparse regions, such as over the oceans.The winds at upper levels, where surface friction does not occur, tend to be approximately geostrophic. In other words, there is a near balance between the pressure gradient force, which directs air from areas of relatively high pressure to areas of relatively low pressure, and the Coriolis force, which deflects air from its straight-line path to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. An important consequence of this geostrophic balance is that the winds blow parallel to isobars (cartographic lines indicating areas of equal pressure), and, according to Buys Ballott's law, lower pressures will be found to the left of the direction of the wind in the Northern Hemisphere and to the right of the wind in the Southern Hemisphere. Furthermore, wind speed increases as the spacing between isobars decreases. In a wavetrain of westerly flow, the regions of cyclonic flow are associated with troughs of low pressure, whereas anticyclonic flow are characterized by ridges of high pressure. Rising motions tend to be found downstream from the troughs and upstream from the ridges, while sinking motions tend to be found downstream from the ridges and upstream from the troughs. The areas of rising motion tend to be associated with clouds and precipitation (inclement weather), whereas the areas of sinking motion tend to be associated with clear skies (fair weather).The vertical variation of the structure of the waves depends upon the temperature pattern. In general, owing to the net difference in incoming shorter-wavelength solar radiation and outgoing longer-wavelength infrared radiation between the polar and the equatorial regions, there is a horizontal temperature gradient in the troposphere. At both the surface and upper levels, the troposphere is warmest at low latitudes and coldest at high latitudes. The atmosphere is mainly in hydrostatic balance, or equilibrium, between the upward-directed pressure gradient force and the downward-directed force of gravity. This circumstance is expressed in the following relationship:where p/z is the partial derivative of p with respect to z, p is the pressure, z is the height, r is the density of the air, and g is the acceleration of gravity. A consequence of this hydrostatic relationship is that the pressure at any level is equal to the weight of the column of air above. According to the ideal gas law,where R is the gas constant and T is the temperature. At any given pressure, the density varies inversely with temperature. Therefore, relatively cold air is heavier than relatively warm air at the same pressure. It follows from (1) and (2) that pressure decreases more rapidly with height at high latitudes in the colder air than it does at lower latitudes in the warmer air. If there is a westerly geostrophic wind at midlevels in the troposphere, then pressure decreases with increasing latitude. Consequently, the horizontal spacing between isobars decreases with height. Thus, the geostrophic wind speed, which approximates the actual wind speed, increases with height. Above the tropopause the pole-to-Equator temperature gradient is reversed as air temperature increases with height, so that the westerlies decrease in intensity in the stratosphere. Thus, the strongest westerly current of winds is located near the tropopause.The aforementioned relationship can be analyzed quantitatively by considering the vertical variation in the geostrophic wind, which is found from the hydrostatic equation (1), the ideal gas law (2), and the geostrophic wind formula, approximately as follows.where is the partial derivative of ug with respect to z, ug and vg are the components of the geostrophic wind in the zonal (straight from west to east) and meridional (north to south) directions, respectively, and f is the Coriolis parameter. The equations given in (3) are known as the thermal-wind relations. The difference between the geostrophic wind at some higher level and the geostrophic wind below is called the thermal wind. It follows that the thermal wind vector is oriented so that in the colder air it lies to the left in the Northern Hemisphere and to the right in the Southern Hemisphere.In addition to the general pole-to-Equator temperature gradient found in the troposphere, there are zonally oriented temperature variations that are wavelike. In fact, to a first approximation, the isotherms (cartographic lines indicating areas of equal temperature) are nearly parallel to the isobars in the upper levels of the troposphere. Most frequently, relatively cold air lies just upstream from upper-level troughs and just downstream from upper-level ridges, while relatively warm air lies just upstream from upper-level ridges and just downstream from upper-level troughs. The thermal-wind relation (3) indicates that the wavetrain of troughs and ridges tilts with height to the west. In the midlatitudes during the summer, and in some locations within the midlatitudes during the winter, the meridional temperature gradient weakens so much that the westerlies become weak or nonexistent. As a result, the wavelike wind field disappears and the flow pattern is that of cyclones and anticyclones cut off from the flow. When cold air is colocated with the upper-level cyclones and warm air is colocated with the upper-level anticyclones, according to (3), both circulation patterns increase in intensity with height and are called cold-core and warm-core systems, respectively. Tropical cyclones, on the other hand, are warm-core systems that are most intense at the surface and that decrease in intensity with height.The vertical structure of upper-level waves has an important effect on smaller-scale features that may be embedded within them. The susceptibility of the atmosphere to vertical overturning (a mixing of lower-level warmer air with higher-level colder air) through deep cumulus convection (e.g., thunderstorms) depends on the rate at which temperature decreases with height. When regions of relatively cold air aloft associated with upper-level troughs or cyclones become superimposed during the winter over relatively warm ocean surfaces or during the summer over hot and humid landmasses, then convective storms can form. The type of mesoscale convective system (MCS) that can form depends in large part on the vertical wind shear. When the vertical shear is very strong, supercells and tornadoes may be spawned, especially during the warmer months. During the winter, bands of precipitation sometimes line up along the vertical shear vector through a process known as slantwise convection.Propagation and development of wavesUpper-level waves in the westerlies in midlatitudes usually move from west to east, in part as a result of advection (a process in which the airflow transports a property of the atmosphere [warmth, cold, etc.] downstream) and in part as a result of propagation, which acts in the opposite direction, toward the west. Rossby showed that to a good approximation,where c is the phase speed of the waves, U is the speed from west to east of the component of upper-level wind due to uniform flow, b is the meridional, or north-south, gradient of the Coriolis parameter (f), and L is the zonal wavelength (the distance between successive troughs or ridges). According to (4), since the magnitude of f increases toward the poles, b is positive, and hence waves whose wavelengths are short have a relatively small component due to propagation. In this situation, advection overwhelms the effect of propagation and the waves move on downstream. On the other hand, if in midlatitudes the wavelength is very long, then the effects of propagation may exactly cancel the effects of advection, and the waves may become stationary; or if the wavelength becomes even longer, then the waves may become retrograde. From (4) it can be seen that Rossby waves owe their propagation characteristics to the north-south variation of f. In nature, temperature effects and heating and cooling over warm and cold surfaces can modify (4) somewhat.The physical basis for (4) and for the development of upper-level systems and how they relate to surface systems is described by an elegant theory developed in the late 1940s called quasigeostrophic theory. A measure of the tendency for a fluid to rotate is known as vorticity and is given by the following equation:where z is the relative vorticity with respect to Earth's surface. The variables x and y are the coordinate axes for space and correspond to the measurements to the east and north, respectively. The variables u and v are zonal and meridional components (the components of motion in the easterly and northerly directions), respectively, of the wind. On the rotating Earth, the vorticity is the sum of the relative vorticity with respect to Earth's surface, given by the aforementioned expression, and Earth's vorticity, given by f, the Coriolis parameter. Troughs are associated with cyclonic vorticity, and ridges are associated with anticyclonic vorticity. In a wavetrain, the pressure falls downstream from troughs, where the wind is directed from the region of maximum vorticity along the trough to the region of minimum vorticity, which is along the ridge, and the pressure rises downstream from ridges. On the other hand, pressure can rise east of troughs (and west of ridges) where there is component of motion from the Equator to the pole. For example, pressure rises from regions of low magnitude of f to higher magnitude of f (from low values of Earth's vorticity to higher values of Earth's vorticity). Likewise, pressure falls west of troughs (and east of ridges) where there is a component of motion from one of the poles to the Equator from relatively high magnitude of f to lower magnitude of f. The effect of pressure increases and decreases is greatest when the wavelength is relatively short, such as when the effects of the advection of Earth's vorticity are overwhelmed by the effects of advection of relative vorticity.The development and amplification of Rossby waves is typically a result of the advection of warmer or colder air at low levels. When warm air is advected underneath a layer of air not experiencing much, if any, advection, the pressure at the top of the layer rises. Conversely, pressure falls when cold air advects under a similar layer of air. If the wavetrain tilts to the west with height so that cold air lies to the west of troughs and thus east of ridges, the pressure aloft in the troughs decreases. Similarly, when warm air lies to the east of troughs and thus west of ridges, the pressure aloft in the ridges increases. As a result, the amplitude of the waves in the wavetrain increases, thereby enhancing the temperature advection process, so that there is a positive feedback mechanism that makes the waves continue to amplify. In this process, called baroclinic instability, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy which occurs as wind as warm, light air rises and cold, heavy air sinks. Since baroclinic instability is associated with horizontal temperature gradients, according to the thermal wind relation (3), there must be vertical wind shear.It is also possible for Rossby waves to amplify through a process called barotropic instability. Barotropic instability, however, requires horizontal shear, not vertical shear; kinetic energy for the waves comes from the mean kinetic energy associated with the westerly wind current. The waves grow in amplitude at the expense of the mean flow. Barotropic instability can occur when the horizontal shear varies with latitude such that the sum of Earth's vorticity and the relative vorticity associated with the horizontal shear is small with respect to latitude.Relationships to surface featuresRossby waves propagating through the upper and middle troposphere cause disturbances to form at the surface. According to quasigeostrophic theory, when there is a wavetrain embedded within a zone of pole-to-Equator temperature gradient, air rises east of upper-level troughs (and west of upper-level ridges) and sinks west of upper-level troughs (and east of upper-level ridges). These vertical air motions are required to maintain the approximate geostrophic and hydrostatic balance, which are necessary for quasigeostrophic equilibrium. Air converges at the surface underneath the rising current of air to compensate for the upward loss of mass and diverges at the surface underneath a sinking current of air to compensate for the downward gain of mass. As a consequence of the lateral deviation of the air by the Coriolis force, Earth's vorticity is converted into cyclonic relative vorticity where air converges and anticyclonic relative vorticity where air diverges. According to the geostrophic wind relation, cyclonic gyres are associated with low-pressure centers, whereas anticyclonic gyres are connected with areas of high pressure. Thus, low-pressure areas form at the surface downstream from upper-level troughs and upstream from upper-level ridges, whereas the reverse is true for high-pressure areas. These surface low- and high-pressure areas thereby create a westward tilt with height of the waves in pressure. Since there tends to be a pole-to-Equator-directed geostrophic wind west of surface lows and east of surface highs, and an Equator-to-pole-directed geostrophic wind east of surface lows and west of surface highs, there is cold advection underneath upper-level troughs and warm advection underneath upper-level ridges; the baroclinic instability process is thus facilitated.Jet streamsThe upper-level wind flow described above is frequently concentrated into relatively narrow bands called jet streams, or jets. The jets, whose wind speeds are usually in excess of 30 meters per second (about 70 miles per hour) but can be as high as 107 meters per second (about 240 miles per hour), act to steer upper-level waves. Jet streams are of great importance to air travel because they affect the ground speed, the velocity relative to the ground, of aircraft. Since strong upper-level flow is usually associated with strong vertical wind shear, jet streams in midlatitudes are accompanied by strong horizontal temperature gradients, as required by the thermal wind relation (3). Some regions of high vertical wind shear are marked by clear-air turbulence (CAT). Jet streams whose extents are relatively isolated are called jet streaks. Well-defined circulation patterns of rising and sinking air are usually found just upstream and downstream, respectively, from jet streaks (that are not too curved). Rising motion is found to the left and right just downstream and upstream, respectively, and sinking motion is found to the right and left just downstream and upstream, respectively. Jets tend to be strongest near the tropopause where the horizontal temperature gradient reverses.The polar front jet moves in a generally westerly direction in midlatitudes, and its vertical wind shear which extends below its core is associated with horizontal temperature gradients that extend to the surface. As a consequence, this jet manifests itself as a front that marks the division between colder air over a deep layer and warmer air over a deep layer. The polar front jet can be baroclinically unstable and break up into waves. The subtropical jet is found at lower latitudes and at slightly higher elevation, owing to the increase in height of the tropopause at lower latitudes. The associated horizontal temperature gradients of the subtropical jet do not extend to the surface, so that a surface front is not evident. In the tropics an easterly jet is sometimes found at upper levels, especially when a landmass is located poleward of an ocean, so the temperature increases with latitude. The polar front jet and the subtropical jet play a role in maintaining Earth's general circulation. They are slightly different in each hemisphere because of differences in the distribution of landmasses and oceans.Winds in the stratosphere and mesosphereThe winds in the stratosphere and mesosphere are usually estimated from temperature data collected by satellites. The winds at these high levels are assumed to be geostrophic. Overall, in the midlatitudes, they have a westerly component in the winter and an easterly component in the summer. The highest zonal winds are around 60-70 meters per second (135-155 miles per hour) at 65-70 km (37-43 miles) above Earth's surface. The west-wind component is stronger during the winter in the Southern Hemisphere. The axes of the strongest easterly and westerly wind components in the Southern Hemisphere tilt toward the south with increased altitude during the Northern Hemisphere winter and the Southern Hemisphere summer. The zonal component of the thermal wind shear is in accord with the zonal distribution of temperature.During the winter there is, in the mean, an intense cyclonic vortex about the poles in the lower stratosphere. Over the North Pole this vortex has an embedded mean trough over northeastern North America and over northeastern Asia, whereas over the Pacific there is a weak anticyclonic vortex. The winter cyclonic vortex over the South Pole is much more symmetrical than the one over the North Pole. During the summer there is an anticyclone above each pole that is much weaker than the wintertime cyclone.In the stratosphere, deviations from the mean behavior of the winds occur during events called sudden warmings, when the meridional temperature gradient reverses on timescales as short as several days. This also has the effect of reversing the zonal wind direction. Sudden warmings tend to occur during the early and middle parts of the winter and the transition period from winter to spring. The latter marks the changeover from the cold winter polar cyclone to the warm summer polar anticyclone. It is noteworthy that long waves from the troposphere can propagate into the stratosphere during the winter when westerlies and sudden warmings occur, but this is not the case during the summer when easterly winds prevail.The zonal component of the winds in the stratosphere above equatorial and tropical regions is, in the mean, relatively weak. This is not necessarily the case at any given time, because they reverse direction on the average every 13-14 months. This phenomenon, which is known as the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), is caused by the interaction of vertically propagating waves with the mean flow. Its effect is greatest around 27 km (17 miles) above Earth's surface in the equatorial region. The strongest easterlies are stronger than the strongest westerlies.The climate of an area is the synthesis of the environmental conditions (soils, vegetation, weather, etc.) that have prevailed there over a long period of time. This synthesis involves both averages of the climatic elements and measurements of variability (such as extreme values and probabilities). Climate is a complex, abstract concept involving data on all aspects of Earth's environment. As such, no two localities on Earth may be said to have exactly the same climate. Nevertheless, it is readily apparent that, over restricted areas of the planet, climates vary within a limited range and that climatic regions are discernible within which some uniformity is apparent in the patterns of climatic elements. Moreover, widely separated areas of the world possess similar climates when the set of geographic relationships occurring in one area parallels that of another. This symmetry and organization of the climatic environment suggests an underlying worldwide regularity and order in the phenomena causing climate (e.g., patterns of incoming solar radiation, vegetation, soils, winds, temperature, and air masses), which were discussed in earlier sections.Climate classification is an attempt to formalize this process of recognizing climatic similarity, of organizing, simplifying, and clarifying the vast amount of environmental data, and of systematizing the long-term effects of interacting climatic processes to enhance scientific understanding of climates. Users of climate classifications should be aware of the limitations of the procedure, however.First, climate is a multidimensional concept, and it is not an obvious decision as to which of the many observed environmental variables should be selected as the basis of the classification. This choice must be made on a number of grounds, both practical and theoretical. For example, using too many different elements opens up the possibilities that the classification will have too many categories to be readily interpreted and that many of the categories will not correspond to real climates. Moreover, measurements of many of the elements of climate are not available for large areas of the world or have been collected for only a short time. The major exceptions are soil, vegetation, temperature, and precipitation data, which are more extensively available and have been recorded for extended periods of time.The choice of variables also is determined by the purpose of the classification (e.g., to account for distribution of natural vegetation, to explain soil formation processes, or to classify climates in terms of human comfort). The variables relevant in the classification will be determined by this purpose, as will the threshold values of the variables chosen to differentiate climatic zones.A second difficulty results from the generally gradual nature of changes in the climatic elements over Earth's surface. Except in unusual situations due to mountain ranges or coastlines, temperature, precipitation, and other climatic variables tend to change only slowly over distance. As a result, climate types tend to change imperceptibly as one moves from one locale on Earth's surface to another. Choosing a set of criteria to distinguish one climatic type from another is thus equivalent to drawing a line on a map to distinguish the climatic region possessing one type from that having the other. While this is in no way different from many other classification decisions that one makes routinely in daily life, it must always be remembered that boundaries between adjacent climatic regions are placed somewhat arbitrarily through regions of continuous, gradual change and that the areas defined within these boundaries are far from homogeneous in terms of their climatic characteristics.Most classification schemes are intended for global- or continental-scale application and define regions that are major subdivisions of continents hundreds to thousands of kilometers across. These may be termed macroclimates. Not only will there be slow changes (from wet to dry, hot to cold, etc.) across such a region as a result of the geographic gradients of climatic elements over the continent of which the region is a part, but there will exist mesoclimates within these regions associated with climatic processes occurring at a scale of tens to hundreds of kilometers that are created by elevation differences, slope aspect, bodies of water, differences in vegetation cover, urban areas, and the like. Mesoclimates, in turn, may be resolved into numerous microclimates, which occur at scales of less than 0.1 km (0.06 mile), as in the climatic differences between forests, crops, and bare soil, at various depths in a plant canopy, at different depths in the soil, on different sides of a building, and so on.These limitations notwithstanding, climate classification plays a key role as a means of generalizing the geographic distribution and interactions among climatic elements, of identifying mixes of climatic influences important to various climatically dependent phenomena, of stimulating the search to identify the controlling processes of climate, and, as an educational tool, to show some of the ways in which distant areas of the world are both different from and similar to one's own home region.Approaches to climatic classificationThe earliest known climatic classifications were those of classical Greek times. Such schemes generally divided the Earth into latitudinal zones based on the significant parallels of 0�, 23.5�, and 66.5� of latitude and on the length of day. Modern climate classification has its origins in the mid-19th century, with the first published maps of temperature and precipitation over Earth's surface, which permitted the development of methods of climate grouping that used both variables simultaneously.Many different schemes of classifying climate have been devised (more than 100), but all of them may be broadly differentiated as either empiric or genetic methods. This distinction is based on the nature of the data used for classification. Empirical methods make use of observed environmental data, such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation, or simple quantities derived from them (e.g., evaporation). In contrast, a genetic method classifies climate on the basis of its causal elements, the activity and characteristics of all factors (air masses, circulation systems, fronts, jet streams, solar radiation, topographic effects, and so forth) that give rise to the spatial and temporal patterns of climatic data. Hence, while empirical classifications are largely descriptive of climate, genetic methods are (or should be) explanatory. Unfortunately, genetic schemes, while scientifically more desirable, are inherently more difficult to implement because they do not use simple observations. As a result, such schemes are both less common and less successful overall. Moreover, the regions defined by the two types of classification schemes do not necessarily correspond; in particular, it is not uncommon for similar climatic forms resulting from different climatic processes to be grouped together by many common empirical schemes.Genetic classificationsGenetic classifications group climates by their causes. Among such methods, three types may be distinguished: (1) those based on the geographic determinants of climate, (2) those based on the surface energy budget, and (3) those derived from air-mass analysis.In the first class are a number of schemes (largely the work of German climatologists) that categorize climates according to such factors as latitudinal control of temperature, continentality versus ocean-influenced factors, location with respect to pressure and wind belts, and effects of mountains. These classifications all share a common shortcoming: they are qualitative, so that climatic regions are designated in a subjective manner rather than as a result of the application of some rigorous differentiating formula.An interesting example of a method based on the energy balance of Earth's surface is the 1970 classification of Werner H. Terjung, an American geographer. His method utilizes data for more than 1,000 locations worldwide on the net radiation received at the surface, the available energy for evaporating water, and the available energy for heating the air and subsurface. The annual patterns are classified according to the maximum energy input, the annual range in input, the shape of the annual curve, and the number of months with negative magnitudes (energy deficits). The combination of characteristics for a location is represented by a label consisting of several letters with defined meanings, and regions having similar net radiation climates are mapped.Probably the most extensively used genetic systems, however, are those that employ air-mass concepts. Air masses are large bodies of air that, in principle, possess relatively homogeneous properties of temperature, humidity, etc., in the horizontal. Weather on individual days may be interpreted in terms of these features and their contrasts at fronts.Two American geographer-climatologists have been most influential in classifications based on air mass. In 1951, Arthur N. Strahler described a qualitative classification based on the combination of air masses present at a given location throughout the year. Some years later (1968 and 1970), John E. Oliver placed this type of classification on a firmer footing by providing a quantitative framework that designated particular air masses and air mass combinations as dominant, subdominant, or seasonal at particular locations. He also provided a means of identifying air masses from diagrams of mean monthly temperature and precipitation plotted on a thermohyet diagram, a procedure that obviates the need for less common upper-air data to make the classification.Empirical classificationsMost empirical classifications are those that seek to group climates based on one or more aspects of the climate system. While many such phenomena have been used in this way, natural vegetation stands out as one of prime importance. The view held by many climatologists is that natural vegetation functions as a long-term integrator of the climate in a region; the vegetation, in effect, is an instrument for measuring climate in the same way that a thermometer measures temperature. Its preeminence is apparent in the fact that many textbooks and other sources refer to climates using the names of vegetation, as, for example, rainforest, taiga, or tundra.Wladimir K�ppen, a German botanist-climatologist, developed the most popular (but not the first) of these vegetation-based classifications. His aim was to devise formulas that would define climatic boundaries in such a way as to correspond to those of the vegetation zones that were being mapped for the first time during his lifetime. K�ppen published his first scheme in 1900 and a revised version in 1918. He continued to revise his system of classification until his death in 1940. Other climatologists have modified portions of K�ppen's procedure on the basis of their experience in various parts of the world.K�ppen's classification is based on a subdivision of terrestrial climates into five major types, which are represented by the capital letters A, B, C, D, and E. Each of these climate types except for B is defined by temperature criteria. Type B designates climates in which the controlling factor on vegetation is dryness (rather than coldness). Aridity is not a matter of precipitation alone but is defined by the relationship between the precipitation input to the soil in which the plants grow and the evaporative losses. Since evaporation is difficult to evaluate and is not a conventional measurement at meteorological stations, K�ppen was forced to substitute a formula that identifies aridity in terms of a temperature-precipitation index (i.e., evaporation is assumed to be controlled by temperature). Dry climates are divided into arid (BW) and semiarid (BS) subtypes, and each may be differentiated further by adding a third code, h for warm and k for cold.As noted above, temperature defines the other four major climate types. These are subdivided, with additional letters again used to designate the various subtypes. Type A climates (the warmest) are differentiated on the basis of the seasonality of precipitation: Af (no dry season), Am (short dry season), or Aw (winter dry season). Type E climates (the coldest) are conventionally separated into tundra (ET) and snow/ice climates (EF). The mid-latitude C and D climates are given a second letter, f (no dry season), w (winter dry), or s (summer dry), and a third symbol (a, b, c, or d [the last subclass exists only for D climates]), indicating the warmth of the summer or the coldness of the winter. The table gives the specific criteria for the K�ppen-Geiger-Pohl system of 1953.The K�ppen classification has been criticized on many grounds. It has been argued that extreme events, such as a periodic drought or an unusual cold spell, are just as significant in controlling vegetation distributions as the mean conditions upon which K�ppen's scheme is based. It also has been pointed out that factors other than those used in the classification, such as sunshine and wind, are important to vegetation. Moreover, it has been contended that natural vegetation can respond only slowly to environmental change, so that the vegetation zones observable today are in part adjusted to past climates. Many critics have drawn attention to the rather poor correspondence between the K�ppen zones and the observed vegetation distribution in many areas of the world. In spite of these and other limitations, the K�ppen system remains the most popular climatic classification in use today.A major contribution to climate grouping was made by the American geographer-climatologist C. Warren Thornthwaite in 1931 and 1948. He first used a vegetation-based approach that made use of the derived concepts of temperature efficiency and precipitation effectiveness as a means of specifying atmospheric effects on vegetation. His second classification retained these concepts in the form of a moisture index and a thermal efficiency index but radically changed the classification criteria and rejected the idea of using vegetation as the climatic integrator, attempting instead to classify rationally on the basis of the numerical values of these indices. His 1948 scheme is encountered in many climatology texts, but it has not gained as large a following among a wide audience as the K�ppen classification system, perhaps because of its complexity and the large number of climatic regions it defines.While vegetation-based climate classifications could be regarded as having relevance to human activity through what they may indicate about agricultural potential and natural environment, they cannot give any sense of how human beings would feel within the various climate types. Terjung's 1966 scheme was an attempt to group climates on the basis of their effects on human comfort. The classification makes use of four physiologically relevant parameters: temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. The first two are combined in a comfort index to express atmospheric conditions in terms perceived as extremely hot, hot, oppressive, warm, comfortable, cool, keen, cold, very cold, extremely cold, and ultra cold. Temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation are combined in a wind effect index expressing the net effect of wind chill (the cooling power of wind on exposed surfaces) and addition of heat to the human body by solar radiation. These indices are combined for different seasons in different ways to express how humans feel in various geographic areas on a yearly basis. Terjung visualized that his classification would find applicability in medical geography, climatological education, tourism, housing, clothing, and as a general analytical tool.Many other specialized empirical classifications have been devised. For example, there are those that differentiate between types of desert and coastal climates, those that account for different rates of rock weathering or soil formation, and those based on the identification of similar agricultural climates.World distribution of major climatic typesThe following discussion of the climates of the world is based on groupings of K�ppen's climatic types. It should be read in conjunction with the table (for the specific criteria defining each type) and K�ppen's climate classification map (for the geographic extent of each type).Type A ClimatesK�ppen's A climates are found in a nearly unbroken belt around the Earth at low latitudes, mostly within 15� N and S. Their location within a region in which available net solar radiation is large and relatively constant from month to month ensures both high temperatures (generally in excess of 18 �C [64 �F]) and a virtual absence of thermal seasons. Typically, the temperature difference between day and night is greater than that between the warmest and the coolest month, the opposite of the situation in mid-latitudes. The terms winter and summer have little meaning, but in many locations annual rhythm is provided by the occurrence of wet and dry seasons. Type A climates are controlled mainly by the seasonal fluctuations of the trade winds, the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), and the Asian monsoon (see above Monsoons and Atmospheric pressure and wind: upper-level winds).Wet equatorial climate (Af)Within about 12� latitude of the Equator lies a region of consistently high temperatures (around 30 �C [86 �F]), with plentiful precipitation (150-1,000 cm [59-394 inches]), heavy cloud cover, and high humidity, with very little annual temperature variation. Such regions lie within the influence of the ITCZ in all months; the converging, ascending air spawns convectional thunderstorm activity with much of the rainfall occurring in late afternoon or early evening when the atmosphere is most susceptible to thunderstorms. While precipitation is profuse in all months, variations do occur in response to the precise location of the ITCZ drier months result when the ITCZ moves away from the region in question. Other zones of Af climate are found beyond the usual margins of ITCZ activity, in coastal Madagascar, southeast coastal Brazil, and much of Central America and western Colombia, where trade winds blow onshore all year to encounter coastlines backed by mountain barriers that stimulate the formation of precipitation as warm, moist tropical air is forced to ascend and cool. Some of these regions also may receive precipitation from tropical disturbances, including hurricanes.Tropical monsoon and trade-wind littoral climates (Am)These climates resemble the Af in most characteristics, with small annual temperature ranges, high temperatures, and plentiful precipitation (often more than Af climates in annual total). They differ from the latter, however, in that they exhibit a short dry season, usually in the low-sun (winter) season. The highest temperatures generally occur at the end of this clear spell. Two distinct processes can give rise to Am climate types. The largest areas, mostly in southern and southeastern Asia, result from the Asian monsoon circulation that brings convective and orographic precipitation in the summer when warm, moist, maritime tropical air moves over land to converge into the low-pressure zone north of the Himalayas. In winter, by contrast, cool, dry air diverges out of the Siberian anticyclone to the north, bringing a cooler, drier, and clearer period of variable length. In the Americas and in Africa, Am climates are of the trade-wind variety. These areas receive precipitation on narrow coastal strips through orographic effects as the moist air of the trade winds ascends mountain chains. Seasonal migrations and changes in the intensity of these winds give rise to short, moderately dry seasons. Summer precipitation may be enhanced by tropical disturbances traveling in the trade winds.Tropical wet-dry climate (Aw)This climate has distinct wet and dry seasons, with most of the precipitation occurring in the high-sun (summer) season. Total amounts of rainfall are less than in the previous two climate types (50-175 cm [20-69 inches]), most of which occur in convectional thunderstorms. The dry season is longer than in the Am climates and becomes progressively longer as one moves poleward through the region. Temperatures are high throughout the year but show a greater range than Af and Am climates (19-20 �C [66-68 �F] in winter and 24-27 �C [75-81 �F] in summer). Throughout most of the region, the cause of the seasonal cycle is the shift in the tropical circulation throughout the year. During the high-sun season, the ITCZ moves poleward and brings convergent and ascending air to these locations, which stimulates convective rainfall. During the low-sun season, the convergence zone moves off to the winter hemisphere and is replaced by the periphery or core of the subtropical anticyclone, with its subsiding, stable air resulting in a period of dry, clear weather, the intensity and length of which depend on latitude. The subtropical anticyclone occurs in the descending portion of the Hadley cell.Type B climatesArid and semiarid climates cover about a quarter of Earth's land surface, mostly between 50� N and 50� S, but they are mainly found in the 15-30� latitude belt in both hemispheres. They exhibit low precipitation, great variability in precipitation from year to year, low relative humidity, high evaporation rates (when water is available), clear skies, and intense solar radiation.Tropical and subtropical desert climate (BWh, part of BWk)Most of Earth's tropical, true desert (BW) climates occur between 15� and 30� latitude, at the poleward end of the Hadley cell circulation (see atmosphere). These regions are dominated in all months by the subtropical anticyclone, with its descending air, elevated inversions, and clear skies. This is an atmospheric environment that inhibits precipitation. The most extreme arid areas also are far removed from sources of moisture-bearing winds in the interiors of continents and are best developed on the western sides of continents, where the subtropical anticyclone shows its most intense development. An exception to the general tendency for aridity to be associated with subsidence is in the so-called Horn of Africa region, where the dryness of Somalia is caused more by the orientation of the landmass in relation to the atmospheric circulation. Both the high- and low-sun monsoonal winds blow parallel to the coast, so that moisture-laden maritime air can penetrate over land only infrequently. In most low-latitude deserts, cloud cover is uncommon (fewer than 30 days per year have clouds in some areas). Precipitation amounts are mostly in the range 0-25 cm (0-10 inches), although the unreliability of precipitation is more significant than the small totals. Average figures have little meaning; a location with a 10-year mean of 5 cm (2 inches), for example, might have received 50 cm (about 20 inches) in one year as a result of an unusual intrusion of moist air, followed by nine years with no measurable precipitation.Temperatures are high, with monthly means in the range 21-32 �C (70-90 �F). Daily temperature variations are extreme. Ranges of 35 �C (63 �F) are not unknown when daytime maxima in excess of 40 �C (104 �F) are followed by a rapid nocturnal temperature drop brought about by the limited capacity of the dry, cloudless desert air to emit infrared radiation to the ground to offset radiation loss from the surface at night. The highest air temperatures recorded on Earth have been in the BWh regions; for example, in shaded, well-ventilated locations, Death Valley in the western United States has reached 57 �C (135 �F), while al-'Aziziyah in Libya has had a recorded high of 58 �C (136 �F). Actual surface temperatures may reach 82 �C (180 �F) on dry sand under intense sunshine.An interesting variant of tropical and subtropical deserts are the so-called West Coast Desert areas found on the western coastal margins of the regions discussed above (e.g., in the Sonoran Desert of North America, the Peru and Atacama deserts of South America, and the Sahara [Moroccan part] and Namib deserts of Africa). These areas are much cooler than their latitude would suggest (monthly mean temperatures of only 15-21 �C [59-70 �F]), and parts are classified as BWk in K�ppen's scheme. The cooling results from airflow off adjacent coastal waters where upwelling of the ocean gives rise to cold currents. Deserts of this sort are subject to frequent fog and low-level clouds; yet they are extremely arid. Some parts of the Atacama Desert, for example, have recorded no precipitation for 20 years.Tropical and subtropical steppe climate (BSh)The low-latitude semiarid (or steppe) climate occurs primarily on the periphery of the true deserts treated above. It is transitional to the Aw climate on the equatorward side (showing a summer rainfall maximum associated with the ITCZ and a small annual temperature range) and to the Mediterranean climate on its poleward margin (with a cooler, wetter winter resulting from the higher latitude and mid-latitude frontal cyclone activity). Annual precipitation totals are greater than in BW climates (38-63 cm [15-25 inches]). Yearly variations in amount are not as extreme as in the true deserts but are nevertheless large.Mid-latitude steppe and desert climate (BSk, part of BWk)Although these climates are contiguous with the tropical dry climates of North and South America and of central Asia, they have different origins. Cool true deserts extend to 50� latitude and cool steppes reach nearly 60� N in the Canadian Prairies, well beyond the limits of the subtropical anticyclone. These climates owe their origins to locations deep within continental interiors, far from the windward coasts and sources of moist, maritime air. Remoteness from sources of water vapor is enhanced in some regions (e.g., the Great Plains of the United States) by mountain barriers upwind. Temperature conditions are extremely variable, with annual means decreasing and annual ranges increasing poleward. In the higher latitudes, winters are severely cold, with meager precipitation (much of it in the form of snow) associated with polar and arctic air masses. Summer precipitation is more often convective, arriving in the form of scattered thunderstorm activity brought about by irregular incursions of moist air. Both BWk and BSk climates in the mid-latitudes owe their origins to these mechanisms, but the steppe type tends to be located peripheral to the true desert, either adjacent to the moister C and D climates or at the poleward extent of the range, where reduced evaporation under cooler conditions makes more of the scarce precipitation available as soil moisture for plant growth.Type C and D climatesThrough a major portion of the middle and high latitudes (mostly from 25� to 70� N and S) lies a group of climates classified within the K�ppen scheme as C and D types. Most of these regions lie beneath the upper-level, mid-latitude westerlies throughout the year, and it is in the seasonal variations in location and intensity of these winds and their associated features that the explanation of their climatic character must be sought. During summer, the polar-front and its jet stream move poleward, and air masses of tropical origin are able to extend to high latitudes. During winter, as the circulation moves equatorward, tropical air retreats and cold polar outbreaks influence weather, even within the subtropical zone. The relative frequency of these air masses of different origins varies gradually from low to high latitude and is largely responsible for the observed temperature change across the belt (which is most marked in winter). The air masses interact in the frontal systems commonly found embedded within the traveling cyclones that lie beneath the polar-front jet stream. Ascent induced by convergence into these low-pressure cells and by uplift at fronts induces precipitation, the main location of which shifts with the seasonal circulation cycle. Other important sources of precipitation are convection, mainly in tropical air, and forced uplift at mountain barriers. Monsoon effects modify this general pattern, while the subtropical anticyclone plays a role in the explanation of climate on the western sides of the continents in the subtropics.Humid subtropical climate (Cfa, Cwa)These climates are found on the eastern sides of the continents between 20� and 35� N and S latitude. Most show a relatively uniform distribution of precipitation throughout the year (the Cfa types), with totals in the range 75-150 cm (30-59 inches). In summer, these regions are largely under the influence of moist, maritime airflow from the western side of the subtropical anticyclonic cells over low-latitude ocean waters. Temperatures are high; the warmest months generally average about 27 �C (81 �F), with mean daily maxima from 30 �C to 38 �C (86 �F to 100 �F) and warm, oppressive nights. Summers are usually somewhat wetter than winters, with much of the rainfall coming from convectional thunderstorm activity; tropical cyclones also enhance warm-season rainfall in some regions. The coldest month is usually quite mild (5-12 �C [41-54 �F]), although frosts are not uncommon, and winter precipitation is derived primarily from frontal cyclones along the polar front. In North America, the spring and early summer seasons, when the front begins its northward return, are notorious for the outbreak of tornadoes associated with frontal thunderstorms along the zone of interaction between tropical and polar air. In eastern and southern Asia, the monsoon influence results in a modified humid subtropical climate (Cwa) that has a clearly defined dry winter when air diverges from the Siberian anticyclone, and the polar front and cyclone paths are deflected around the region. These areas generally lie on the poleward side of Am and Aw climates and exhibit a somewhat larger annual temperature range than Cfa types. Winters are sunny and rather cool. Annual precipitation totals average about 100 cm (39 inches) but vary from 75 to 200 cm (30 to 79 inches).Mediterranean climate (Csa, Csb)Between about 30� and 45� latitude on the western sides of the continents is found a series of climates that show the unusual combination of hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Poleward extension and expansion of the subtropical anticyclonic cells over the oceans bring subsiding air to the region in summer, with clear skies and high temperatures. When the anticyclone moves equatorward in winter, it is replaced by traveling, frontal cyclones with their attendant precipitation. Annual temperature ranges are generally smaller than those found in the Cfa climates, since locations on the western sides of continents are not well positioned to receive the coldest polar air, which develops over land rather than over the ocean. Mediterranean climates also tend to be drier than humid subtropical ones, with precipitation totals ranging from 35 to 90 cm (14 to 35 inches); the lowest amounts occur in interior regions adjacent to the semiarid steppe climates. Some coastal locations (e.g., southern California in the western United States) exhibit relatively cool summer conditions and frequent fogs where cold offshore currents prevail. Only in Europe, where the latitude for this climate type fortuitously corresponds to an ocean basin (that of the Mediterranean, from which this climate derives its name), does this climate type extend eastward away from the coast for any significant distance.Marine west coast climate (Cfb, Cfc)Poleward of the Mediterranean climate region on the western sides of the continents, between 35� and 60� N and S latitude are regions that exhibit ample precipitation in all months. Unlike their equatorward neighbours, these areas are located beyond the farthest poleward extent of the subtropical anticyclone, and they experience the mid-latitude westerlies and traveling frontal cyclones all year. Precipitation totals vary somewhat throughout the year in response to the changing location and intensity of these storm systems, but annual accumulations generally range from 50 to 250 cm (20 to 98 inches), with local totals exceeding 500 cm (197 inches) where onshore winds encounter mountain ranges. Not only is precipitation plentiful but it is also reliable and frequent. Many areas have rainfall more than 150 days per year, although the precipitation is often of low intensity. Fog is common in autumn and winter, but thunderstorms are infrequent. Strong gales with high winds may be encountered in winter. These are equable climates with few extremes of temperature. Annual ranges are rather small (10-15 �C or [50-59 �F]), about half those encountered farther to the east in the continental interior at the same latitude. Mean annual temperatures are usually 7-13 �C (45-55 �F) in lowland areas, the winters are mild, and the summers are relatively moderate, rarely having monthly temperatures above 20 �C (68 �F).In North and South America, Australia, and New Zealand, north south mountain ranges backing the west coasts of the landmasses at these latitudes confine the marine west coast climate to relatively narrow coastal strips (but enhance precipitation). By contrast, in Europe the major mountain chains (the Alps and Pyrenees) run east-west, permitting Cfb and Cfc climates to extend inland some 2,000 km (about 1,250 miles) into eastern Germany and Poland.Humid continental climate (Dfa, Dfb, Dwa, Dwb)The D climates are primarily Northern Hemispheric phenomena, since landmasses are absent at the significant latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. The humid continental subgroup occupies a region between 30� and 60� N in central and eastern North America and Asia in the major zone of conflict between polar and tropical air masses. These regions exhibit large seasonal temperature contrasts with hot summers and cold winters. Precipitation tends to be ample throughout the year in the Df section, being derived both from frontal cyclones and, in summer months, from convectional showers when maritime tropical air pushes northward behind the retreating polar front. Many areas show a distinct summer precipitation maximum because of this convective activity, although more uniform patterns are not uncommon. Severe thunderstorms and tornadoes are an early summer occurrence when the polar front is in the southern margin of the Dfa region. Winter precipitation often occurs in the form of snow, and a continuous snow cover is established for from one to four months in many parts of the region, especially in the north. This snow often arrives in conjunction with high winds from an intense frontal cyclone, giving rise to a blizzard.Winters tend to be cold but are subject to occasional frigid or mild spells brought about by periodic incursions of arctic or tropical air. Indeed the changeable nature of weather in all seasons is a characteristic feature of the climate, especially in such areas as the eastern United States and Canada where there are few topographic barriers to limit the exchange of air masses between high and low latitudes. Mean temperatures are typically below freezing from one to several months, and the frost-free season varies from fewer than 150 to 200 days per year. Annual precipitation totals range from 50 to 125 cm (about 20 to 50 inches), with higher amounts in the south of the region and in the uplands.In eastern Asia (Manchuria and Korea), a monsoonal variant of the humid continental climate (Dwa, Dwb) occurs. This climate type has a pronounced summer precipitation maximum and a cold, dry winter dominated by continental polar air diverging out of the nearby Siberian anticyclone.Continental subarctic climate (Dfc, Dfd, Dwc, Dwd)North of the humid continental climate, from about 50� to 70� N, in a broad swath extending from Alaska to Newfoundland in North America and from northern Scandinavia to Siberia in Eurasia, lie the continental subarctic climates. These are regions dominated by the winter season, a long, bitterly cold period with short, clear days, relatively little precipitation (mostly in the form of snow), and low humidity. In Asia the Siberian anticyclone, the source of continental polar air, dominates the interior, and mean temperatures 40-50 �C (40-58 �F) below freezing are not unusual. The North American representative of this climate is not as severe but is still profoundly cold. Mean monthly temperatures are below freezing for six to eight months, with an average frost-free period of only 50-90 days per year, and snow remains on the ground for many months. Summers are short and mild, with long days and a prevalence of frontal precipitation associated with maritime tropical air within traveling cyclones. Mean temperatures in summer only rarely exceed 16 �C (61 �F), except in interior regions where values near 25 �C (77 �F) are possible. As a result of these temperature extremes, annual temperature ranges are larger in continental subarctic climates than in any other climate type on Earth, up to 30 �C (54 �F) through much of the area and more than 60 �C (108 �F) in central Siberia, although coastal areas are more moderate. Annual precipitation totals are mostly less than 50 cm (about 20 inches), with a concentration in the summer. Higher totals, however, occur in marine areas near warm ocean currents. Such areas also are generally somewhat more equable and may be designated marine subarctic climates. Areas with a distinct dry season in winter, which results in the K�ppen climate types Dwc and Dwd, occur in eastern Siberia, both in the region where the wintertime anticyclone is established and in the peripheral areas subject to dry, divergent airflow from it.Type E climatesK�ppen's type E climates are controlled by the polar and arctic air masses of high latitudes (60� N and S and higher). These climates are characterized by low temperatures and precipitation and by a surprisingly great diversity of subtypes.Tundra climate (ET)Tundra climates occur between 60� and 75� of latitude, mostly along the Arctic coast of North America and Eurasia and on the coastal margins of Greenland. Mean annual temperatures are below freezing and annual ranges are large (but not as large as in the adjacent continental subarctic climate). Summers are generally mild, with daily maxima from 15 to 18 �C (59 �F to 64 �F), although the mean temperature of the warmest month must be less than 10 �C (50 �F). Days are long (a result of the high latitude), but they are often cloudy. The snow cover of winter melts in the warmer season (though in places with mean annual temperatures of -9 �C [16 �F] or less the ground at depth remains permanently frozen as permafrost); however, frosts and snow are possible in any month. Winters are long and cold (temperatures may be below 0 �C [32 �F] for 6 to 10 months), especially in the region north of the Arctic Circle where, for at least one day in the year, the Sun does not rise. Winter precipitation generally consists of dry snow, with seasonal totals less than in the summer when cyclonic storms that develop along the boundary between the open sea and sea ice yield rainfall. Typical annual totals are less than 35 cm (about 14 inches), but a range from 25 to 100 cm (10 to 39 inches) is possible, with higher totals in upland areas.Snow and ice climate (EF)This climate occurs poleward of 65� N and S latitude over the ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica and over the permanently frozen portion of the Arctic Ocean. Temperatures are below freezing throughout the year, and annual temperature ranges are large but again not as large as in the continental subarctic climates. Winters are frigid, with mean monthly temperatures from -20 �C to -65 �C (-4 �F to -85 �F); the lowest temperatures occur at the end of the long polar night. The EF climate holds the distinction for the lowest recorded temperatures at Earth's surface: the Vostok II research station in Antarctica holds the record for the lowest extreme temperature (-89.2 �C [-129 �F]), while the Plateau Station has the lowest annual mean (-56 �C [-69 �F]). Daily temperature variations are very small, because the presence of snow and ice at the surface refrigerates the air. Precipitation is meager in the cold, stable air (in most cases, 5 to 50 cm [2 to 20 inches]), with the largest amounts occurring on the coastal margins. Most of this precipitation results from the periodic penetration of a cyclone into the region, which brings snow and ice pellets and, with strong winds, blizzards. High winds also occur in the outer portions of the Greenland and Antarctic EF climates, where cold, dense air drains off the higher, central sections of the ice caps as katabatic winds (see above Local wind systems).Type H climatesThe major highland regions of the world (the Cascades, Sierra Nevadas, and Rockies of North America, the Andes of South America, the Himalayas and adjacent ranges and the Tibetan Highlands [or Plateau] of Asia, the eastern highlands of Africa, and the central portions of Borneo and New Guinea) cannot be classified realistically at this scale of consideration, since the effects of altitude and relief give rise to myriad mesoclimates and microclimates. This diversity over short horizontal distances is unmappable at the continental scale. Very little of a universal nature can be written about such mountain areas except to note that, as a rough approximation, they tend to resemble cooler, wetter versions of the climates of nearby lowlands in terms of their annual temperature ranges and seasonality of precipitation. Otherwise, only the most general characteristics may be noted.With increasing height, temperature, pressure, atmospheric humidity, and dust content decrease. The reduced amount of air overhead results in high atmospheric transparency and enhanced receipt of solar radiation (especially of ultraviolet wavelength) at elevation. Altitude also tends to increase precipitation, at least for the first 4,000 meters (about 13,100 feet). The orientation of mountain slopes has a major impact on solar radiation receipt and temperature and also governs exposure to wind. Mountains can have other effects on the wind climate; valleys can increase wind speeds by funneling regional flows and may generate mesoscale mountain- and valley-wind circulations as well. Cold air also may drain from higher elevations to create frost pockets in low-lying valleys. Furthermore, mountains can act as barriers to the movement of air masses, can cause differences in precipitation amounts between windward and leeward slopes (the reduced precipitation on and downwind from lee slopes is called a rain shadow), and, if high enough, can collect permanent snow and ice on their peaks and ridges; the snow line varies in elevation from sea level in the subarctic to about 5,500 meters (about 18,000 feet) at 150-25� N and S latitude.The connection between climate and life arises from a two-way exchange of mass and energy between the atmosphere and the biosphere. In Earth's early history, before life evolved, only geochemical and geophysical processes determined the composition, structure, and dynamics of the atmosphere. Since life evolved on Earth, biochemical and biophysical processes have played a role in the determination of the composition, structure, and dynamics of the atmosphere. Humans, Homo sapiens, are increasingly shouldering this role by mediating interactions between the biosphere and the atmosphere.The living organisms of the biosphere use gases from, and return waste gases to, the atmosphere, and the composition of the atmosphere is a product of this gas exchange. It is very likely that, prior to the evolution of life on Earth, 95 percent of the atmosphere was made up of carbon dioxide, and water vapor was the second most abundant gas. Other gases were present in trace amounts. This atmosphere was the product of geochemical and geophysical processes in the interior of Earth and was mediated by volcanic outgassing. It is estimated that the great mass of carbon dioxide in this early atmosphere gave rise to an atmospheric pressure 60 times that of modern times. Today only about 0.035 percent of Earth's atmosphere is carbon dioxide. Much of the carbon dioxide present in Earth's first atmosphere has been removed by photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, and weathering. Currently, most of the carbon dioxide now resides in Earth's limestone sedimentary rocks, in coral reefs, in fossil fuels, and in the living components of the present-day biosphere. In this transformation, the atmosphere and the biosphere coevolved through continuous exchanges of mass and energy.Biogenic gases are gases critical for, and produced by, living organisms. In the contemporary atmosphere, they include oxygen, nitrogen, water vapor, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, nitric acid, ammonia and ammonium ions, nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, dimethyl sulfide, and a complex array of non-methane hydrocarbons. Of these gases, only nitrogen and oxygen are not greenhouse gases. Added to this roster of biogenic gases is a much longer list of human-generated gases from industrial, commercial, and cultural activities that reflect the diversity of the human enterprise on Earth.The Gaia hypothesisThe notion that the biosphere exerts important controls on the atmosphere and other parts of the Earth system has increasingly gained acceptance among earth and ecosystem scientists. While this concept has its origins in the work of American oceanographer Alfred C. Redfield in the mid-1950s, it was English scientist and inventor James Lovelock that gave it its modern currency in the late 1970s. Lovelock initially proposed that the biospheric transformations of the atmosphere support the biosphere in an adaptive way through a sort of genetic group selection. This idea generated extensive criticism and spawned a steady stream of new research that has enriched the debate and advanced both ecology and environmental science. Lovelock called his idea the Gaia Hypothesis and defined Gaia asa complex entity involving Earth's biosphere, atmosphere, oceans, and soil; the totality constituting a feedback of cybernetic systems which seeks an optimal physical and chemical environment for life on this planet.The Greek word Gaia, or Gaea, meaning Mother Earth, is Lovelock's name for Earth, which is envisioned as a superorganism engaged in planetary biogeophysiology. The goal of this superorganism is to produce a homeostatic, or balanced, Earth system. The scientific process of research and debate will eventually resolve the issue of the reality of the Gaian homeostatic superorganism, and Lovelock has since revised his hypothesis to exclude goal-driven genetic group selection. Nevertheless, it is now an operative norm in contemporary science that the biosphere and the atmosphere interact in such a way that an understanding of one requires an understanding of the other. Furthermore, the reality of two-way interactions between climate and life is well recognized.The evolution of life and the atmosphereLife on Earth began at least as early as 3.5 billion years ago during the middle of the Archean Eon (about 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago). It was during this interval that life first began to exercise certain controls on the atmosphere. The atmosphere's prebiological state is often characterized as being rich in water vapor and carbon dioxide. Though some nitrogen was also present, little if any oxygen was available. Chemical reactions with hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen, and reduced compounds of nitrogen and sulfur precluded any but the shortest lifetime for free oxygen in the atmosphere. As a result, life evolved in an atmosphere that was reducing (high hydrogen content) rather than oxidizing (high oxygen content). In addition to their chemically reducing character, the predominant gases of this prebiotic atmosphere, with the exception of nitrogen, were largely transparent to incoming sunlight but opaque to outgoing terrestrial infrared radiation. As a result, these gases are called, perhaps improperly, greenhouse gases (see greenhouse effect) because they are able to slow the release of outgoing radiation back into space.In the Archean Eon, the Sun produced as much as 25 percent less light than it does today; however, Earth's temperature was much like that of today. This is possible because the greenhouse gas-rich Archean atmosphere was effective in retarding the loss of terrestrial radiation to space. The resulting long residence time of energy within the Earth-atmosphere system resulted in a warmer atmosphere than would have been possible otherwise. The average temperature of Earth's surface in the early Archean Eon was warmer than the modern global average. It was, according to some sources, probably similar to temperatures found in today's tropics. Depending on the amount of nitrogen present during the Archean Eon, it has been suggested that the atmosphere may have held more than 1,000 times as much carbon dioxide than it does today.Archean organisms included photosynthetic and chemosynthetic bacteria, methane-producing bacteria, and a more primitive group of organisms now called the Archaea (a group of prokaryotes more related to eukaryotes than to bacteria and found in extreme environments). Through their metabolic processes, organisms of the Archean Eon slowly changed the atmosphere. Hydrogen rose from trace amounts to about 1 part per million (ppm) of dry air. Methane concentrations increased from near zero to about 100 ppm. Oxygen increased from near zero to 1 ppm, whereas nitrogen concentrations rose to encompass 99 percent of all atmospheric molecules excluding water vapor. Carbon dioxide concentrations decreased to only 0.3 percent of the total; however, this was nearly 10 times the current concentration. The composition of the atmosphere, its radiation budget, its thermodynamics, and its fluid dynamics were transformed by life from the Archean Eon.American geochemist Robert Garrels calculated that, in the absence of life and given the burial rate of carbon in rocks, oxygen would be unavailable to form water, and free hydrogen would be lost to space. Without the presence of life and compounded by this loss of hydrogen, there would be no oceans, and Earth would have become merely a dusty planet by the middle of the Archean Eon. By the end of the Archean Eon 2.5 billion years ago, both the pigment chlorophyll and photosynthetic organisms had evolved such that the production of oxygen increased rapidly. The atmosphere became transformed from a reducing atmosphere with carbon dioxide, limited oxygen, and anaerobic organisms (that is, life-forms that do not require oxygen for respiration) in control to one with an oxidizing atmosphere that was rich in oxygen, poor in carbon dioxide, and dominated by aerobic organisms (that is, life-forms requiring oxygen for respiration).With the decline in carbon dioxide and a rise in oxygen, the greenhouse warming capacity of Earth's atmosphere was sharply reduced; however, this happened over a period of time when the energy produced by the Sun increased systematically. These compensating changes resulted in a relatively constant planetary temperature over much of Earth's history.The role of the biosphere in the Earth-atmosphere systemThe biosphere and Earth's energy budgetBiogenic gases in the atmosphere play a role in the dynamics of Earth's planetary radiation budget, the thermodynamics of the planet's moist atmosphere, and, indirectly, the mechanics of the fluid flows that are Earth's planetary wind systems. In addition, human cultural and economic activities add a new dimension to the relationship between the biosphere and the atmosphere. While humans are biologically trivial compared with bacteria in the exchange of gases with the atmosphere, chemical compounds produced from human industrial activities and other economic enterprises are changing the gaseous composition of the atmosphere in climatically significant ways. The largest changes involve the harvesting of ancient carbon stores. This organic material has been transformed into fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas, and others) by geologic processes acting upon the remains of plants and animals over many millions of years. Different forms of carbon may be burned and thus used as energy sources. In so doing, organic carbon is converted into carbon dioxide. Additionally, humans are also burning trees, grasses, and other biomass for cooking purposes and clearing the land for agriculture and other activities. The combination of burning both fossil fuels and biomass is enriching the atmosphere with carbon dioxide and adding to the essential reservoir of greenhouse gases (see global warming).Earth's atmosphere is largely transparent to sunlight. Of the sunlight absorbed by the entire Earth-atmosphere system, about one-third is absorbed by the atmosphere and two-thirds by Earth's surface. Sunlight is absorbed by the molecules of the atmosphere, by cloud droplets, and by dust and debris. Though oxygen and nitrogen make up nearly 99 percent of the atmosphere, these diatomic molecules do not vibrate in a way that permits them to absorb terrestrial radiation. They are largely transparent to outgoing terrestrial radiation as well as to incoming solar radiation.Over the continents, the surface cover of vegetation is the principal absorbing medium of Earth's surface, although other surfaces such as bare rock, sand, and water also absorb solar radiation. At night, absorption at the surface (that is, below 1.2 meters [4 feet]) is reradiated, in the form of long-wave infrared radiation, away from Earth's surface back toward space. Most of this infrared radiation is absorbed by the principal biogenic trace gases of the atmosphere the so-called greenhouse gases: water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane. Without these biogenic greenhouse gases, Earth would be 33 �C (59 �F) colder on average than it is. A moderate-emission scenario from the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report predicts that the continued addition of greenhouse gases from fossil fuels will increase the average global temperature by between 2.3 and 4.3 �C (4.1 and 7.7 �F) over the next century. Other scenarios, predicting greater greenhouse gas emissions, forecast even greater global warming.The cycling of biogenic atmospheric gasesThe cycling of oxygen, nitrogen, water vapor, and carbon dioxide, as well as the trace gases methane, ammonia, various oxides of nitrogen and sulfur, and non-methane hydrocarbons between the atmosphere and the biosphere results in relatively constant proportions of these compounds in the atmosphere over time. Without the continuous generation of these gases by the biosphere, they would quickly disappear from the atmosphere.The carbon cycle, as it relates to the biosphere, is simple in its essence. Inorganic carbon (carbon dioxide) is converted to organic carbon (the molecules of life). To complete the cycle, organic carbon is then converted back to inorganic carbon. Ultimately, the carbon cycle is powered by sunlight as green plants and cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) use sunlight to split water into oxygen and hydrogen and to fix carbon dioxide into organic carbon. Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere, and oxygen is added. Animals engage in aerobic respiration, in which oxygen is consumed and organic carbon is oxidized to manufacture inorganic carbon dioxide. It should be noted that chemosynthetic bacteria, which are found in deep-ocean and cave ecosystems, also fix carbon dioxide and produce organic carbon. Instead of using sunlight as an energy source, these bacteria rely on the oxidation of either ammonia or sulfur.The carbon cycle is fully coupled to the oxygen cycle. Each year, photosynthesis fixes carbon dioxide and releases 100,000 megatons of oxygen to the atmosphere. Respiration by animals and living organisms consumes about the same amount of oxygen and produces carbon dioxide in return. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are thus coupled in two linked cycles. On a seasonal basis, an enrichment of atmospheric carbon dioxide occurs in the winter half of the year, whereas a drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide takes place during the summer.The nitrogen cycle begins with the fixing of inorganic atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into organic compounds. These nitrogen-containing compounds are used by organisms and, through the process of denitrification, are converted back to inorganic atmospheric nitrogen. Ammonia and ammonium ions are the products of nitrogen fixation and may be incorporated into some organisms as organic nitrogen-containing molecules. In addition, ammonium ions may be oxidized to form nitrites, which can be further oxidized by nitrifying bacteria into nitrates. Though both nitrites and nitrates may be used to make organic nitrogen-containing molecules, nitrates are especially useful for plant growth and are key compounds that support both terrestrial and aquatic food chains. Nitrates may also be denitrified by bacteria to produce nitrogen gas. This process completes the nitrogen cycle.The nitrogen cycle is coupled to both the carbon and oxygen cycles. Seventy-eight percent of the gases of the atmosphere by volume is diatomic nitrogen. Diatomic nitrogen is the most stable of the nitrogen-containing gases of the atmosphere. Only 300 megatons of nitrogen must be produced each year by denitrifying bacteria to account for losses. These losses mostly occur during lightning discharges and during nitrogen-fixation activities by blue-green algae and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. (The latter are found in the root nodules of certain plants called legumes.) Nitrogen-fixing bacteria use atmospheric nitrogen to produce oxides of nitrogen. Denitrifying bacteria convert nitrates in soils and wetlands to nitrogen gas, which is then returned to the atmosphere.Nitrous oxide occurs in trace amounts (0.3 ppm) in the atmosphere. Between 100 and 300 megatons of nitrous oxide are produced by soil and marine bacteria each year to maintain this concentration. In the atmosphere, nitrous oxide is short-lived because it is quickly broken down by ultraviolet light. Nitric oxide (NO), a minor contributor in the breakdown of stratospheric ozone, is the by-product of this reaction.Like nitrous oxide, ammonia is also produced in soils and marine waters by bacteria and escapes into the atmosphere. Nearly 1,000 megatons are added to the atmosphere each year. Ammonia decreases the acidity of precipitation and serves as a nutrient for plants when returned to the land via precipitation.There are six major sulfur-containing biogenic atmospheric gases that are part of the sulfur cycle. They include hydrogen sulfide, carbon disulfide (CS2), carbonyl sulfide (COS), dimethyl sulfide (DMS; C2H6S), dimethyl disulfide ([CH3S]2), and methyl mercaptan (CH3SH). Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is an oxidation product of these sulfur gases, and it is also added to the atmosphere by volcanoes, burning biomass, and anthropogenic sources (i.e., smelting metals and coal ignition). SO2 is removed from the atmosphere and returned to the biosphere in rainfall. The increased acidity of rain and snow from anthropogenic additions of SO2 and oxides of nitrogen is often referred to as acid precipitation. The acidity of this precipitation and other phenomena, such as acid fog, is partly cancelled by the release of ammonia in the atmosphere.The concentration of methane at any one time in the atmosphere is only about 1.7 ppm. Though only a trace gas, it is highly reactive and plays a key role in the chemical reactions that control the composition of the atmosphere. Methanogenic bacteria in wetland sediments decompose organic matter and release 1,000 megatons of gaseous methane to the atmosphere per year. In the lower atmosphere, methane reacts with oxygen to produce water and carbon dioxide. Each year 2,000 megatons of oxygen are removed from the atmosphere by this mechanism. This loss of oxygen must be replaced by photosynthesis. Some methane reaches the upper stratosphere, where its interaction with oxygen is a major source of upper stratospheric moisture. Within wetlands, bacteria produce methyl halide compounds (methyl chloride [CH3Cl] and methyl iodide [CH3I] gases), whereas these same methyl halides are produced in forests by fungi. These gases, upon reaching the stratosphere, regulate the production of stratospheric ozone by contributing to its natural breakdown (see ozonosphere). Without the continual production of methane by methanogenic bacteria, the oxygen concentration of the atmosphere would increase by 1 percent in only 12,000 years. Dangerously high levels of oxygen in the atmosphere would greatly increase the incidence of wildfires. If the oxygen concentration of Earth's atmosphere rose from its current concentration of 21 percent to 25 percent, even damp twigs and grass would easily ignite. Non-methane hydrocarbons of terrestrial origin are generally well mixed in the free atmosphere above the planetary boundary layer (PBL; see below). These organic particles weaken incoming solar radiation as it passes through the atmosphere, and reductions of 1 percent have been recorded.Biosphere controls on the structure of the atmosphereBecause the biosphere plays a key role in the flux of energy from the surface to the atmosphere, it also contributes to the structure of the atmosphere. Three major fluxes are important: the direct transfer of heat from the surface to the atmosphere by conduction and convection (sensible heating), the energy flux to the atmosphere carried by water vapor via evaporation and transpiration from the surface (latent heat energy), and the flux of radiant energy from the surface to the atmosphere (infrared terrestrial radiation). These fluxes differ in the altitude at which the heating of the air takes place and thus contribute to the thermal structuring of the atmosphere. Sensible heating primarily warms the planetary boundary layer (PBL) of the atmosphere. In marine areas, the PBL occurs in the lowest 1 km (3,300 feet); in heavily vegetated areas, the PBL occurs in the lowest 1 to 2 km (3,300 to 6,600 feet); and in arid regions, it occurs in the lowest 4 or 5 km (13,100 to 16,400 feet) of the atmosphere. In contrast, the latent heat of the atmosphere is released when the water vapor is converted into cloud droplets by condensation. Heating by latent energy release generally occurs above the PBL.On the other hand, heating of the atmosphere by radiation from the surface depends on the density of the atmosphere and its water vapor content. Radiative heating from the surface declines with increasing altitude. The availability of water to evaporate from the surface limits the sensible heating of the air near the surface and so limits the maximum daytime surface air temperature (see below).Biosphere controls on the planetary boundary layerThe top of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) can be visually marked by the elevation of the base of the clouds. In addition, the PBL can also be denoted by a thin layer of haze often seen by passengers aboard airplanes during takeoff from airports. During the day, the air within the PBL is thoroughly mixed by convection induced by the heating of Earth's surface. The thickness of the PBL depends on the intensity of this surface heating and the amount of water evaporated into the air from the biosphere. In general, the greater the heating of the surface, the deeper the PBL. Over deserts, the PBL may extend up to 4 or 5 km (13,100 or 16,400 feet) in altitude. In contrast, the PBL is less than 1 km (0.6 mile) thick over ocean areas, since little surface heating takes place there because of the vertical mixing of water. The wetter the air advected into the region and the greater the additional water added by evaporation and transpiration, the lower the height of the top of the PBL. For every 1 �C (1.8 �F) increase in daily maximum surface temperature for a well-mixed PBL, the top of the PBL is elevated 100 meters (about 325 feet). In New England forests during the days following the spring leafing, it has been shown that the top of the PBL is lowered to between 200 and 400 meters (650 and 1,300 feet). By contrast, during the months before the leafing out, the PBL thickens from solar heating as the sun rises higher in the sky and day length increases.If convective mixing of the air in the PBL is vigorous, convection currents may penetrate through the temperature inversion at the top of the PBL. The cooling of the lifting air initiates the condensation of water vapor and the development of miniscule particles of liquid water called cloud droplets. The small clouds just above the PBL are known as planetary boundary layer clouds. These clouds scatter direct sunlight. As the ratio of diffuse sunlight to direct beam sunlight increases, greater levels of photosynthetic productivity are favoured in the biosphere below. The result is a dynamic synergy between the atmosphere and biosphere.The landscapes of most human-dominated ecosystems are decidedly patchy in their geography (see below). Cities, suburbs, fields, forests, lakes, and shopping centers both heat and evaporate water into the air of the PBL according to the nature of the surfaces involved. Convection and the prospect of breaking through the top of the PBL vary markedly across such heterogeneous landscapes. These upward and downward currents or vertical eddies within the PBL transfer mass and energy upward from the surface. The frequency, timing, and strength of convective weather elements, including thunderstorms, vary according to the patchiness of the land use and land cover pattern of the area. In general, the greater the patchiness of the landscape and the earlier the hour in the day, the more frequent and more intense these rain-producing systems become.In the absence of an organized storm in the region, the air above the PBL sinks gently and the air below lifts. At the top of the PBL, a small inversion, where temperatures increase with height, develops. This inversion essentially becomes a stable layer in the atmosphere. Emissions from the biosphere below are thus contained within the PBL and may build up below this layer over time. Consequently, the PBL may become quite turbid, hazy, or filled with smog.When the sinking from above is vigorous, the PBL inversion grows in thickness. This situation has the effect of hindering the development of thunderstorms, which depend on rapidly rising air. This often occurs over southern California, and thus the chance of thunderstorms forming there is small. Emissions from both the biosphere and from anthropogenic activities accumulate in this part of the atmosphere, and pollution may build up to such an extent that health warnings may be required. In locations free of temperature inversions, convection processes are strong enough, particularly during the summer months, that emissions are scavenged and quickly lifted by thunderstorms to regions high above the PBL. Often, acidic compounds from these emissions are returned to the surface in the precipitation that falls.Biosphere controls on maximum temperatures by evaporation and transpirationSolar radiation is converted to sensible and latent heat at Earth's surface. A change in sensible heat results in a change in the temperature of a medium, whereas energy stored as latent heat is used to drive a process, such as a phase change in a substance from its liquid to its gaseous state, and does not produce a change in temperature. Thus, the daily maximum surface temperature at a given location is dependent on the amount of radiant energy converted to sensible heat. Water available for evaporation increases latent heating by adding water vapor to the atmosphere. As a result, relatively little energy remains to heat the air, and thus the sensible heating of the air near the ground is minimized. In addition, daily maximum temperatures are not as high in locations with strong latent heating.As day length increases from winter to summer, sensible heating and maximum surface temperatures rise. In the U.S. Midwest, prior to the leafing out of vegetation in the springtime and the resulting rise in evaporation and transpiration, sensible heating causes an average increase in maximum surface temperatures of only about 0.3 �C (0.5 �F) per day. The process of leaf production creates a surge in evaporation and transpiration and results in increased latent heating and reduced sensible heating. After leafing, since most of the available thermal energy is used to convert liquid water to water vapor rather than to heat the air, the average day-to-day rise in daily maximum temperatures is reduced to about 0.1 �C (0.2 �F) per day.This effect extends upward through the atmosphere. Prior to leafing out, the one-kilometer-thick layer occurring between the 850-to-750-millibar pressure level (which typically occurs between 1,650 and 2,750 meters [5,400 and 9,000 feet]) in the Midwest warmed at the rate of 0.1 �C (0.2 �F) per day. Following leafing out, the warming rate fell to 0.02 �C (0.04 �F) per day. Scientists have used computer models of the atmosphere to study the effect of transpiration from vegetation on maximum surface air temperatures. In these models, the variable controlling transpiration by vegetation was turned off, and the character of the resulting modeled climate was studied. By subtracting the effect of transpiration, temperatures in central North America and on the other continents were predicted to equilibrate at a very hot 45 �C (113 �F). Such warming is nearly realized in desert areas where moisture is unavailable for transpiration.Biosphere controls on minimum temperaturesDuring the late 1860s, British experimental physicist John Tyndall, based on his studies of the infrared radiation absorption by atmospheric gases, concluded that nighttime minimum temperatures were dependent on the concentration of trace gases in the atmosphere. Of these gases, water vapor had the greatest impact. To emphasize the significance of water vapor on decreases in air temperature during the night, he wrote that if all the water vapor in the air over England was removed even for a single night, it would be attended by the destruction of every plant which a freezing temperature could kill. As a result, it follows that the greater the water content of the atmosphere, the lower the radiative loss of energy to the sky and the less the surface atmosphere is cooled. Thus, locations with substantial amounts of water vapor experience reduced nocturnal cooling.Water vapor in the atmosphere also limits the extent to which temperatures fall at night. This limiting temperature is known as the dew point, which is defined as the temperature at which condensation begins. Over North America east of the 100th meridian (a line of longitude traditionally dividing the moist eastern part of North America from drier western areas), average nighttime minimum temperatures are within a degree or two of the dew point temperature. Upon nocturnal cooling, the dew point is reached, condensation begins, and latent energy is converted to heat. Additional temperature falls are retarded by this release of heat to the atmosphere. A significant fraction of the water in the atmosphere over the continents comes from the evaporation of water from soils and the transpiration from vegetation. Transpired water directly moderates temperature by increasing humidity and thus raising the dew point. As a consequence, the amount of outgoing terrestrial radiation released to space is reduced. This results in the elevation of the minimum temperature of the air above what it would otherwise be.The effect of spring leafing on the buildup of humidity in the lower atmosphere has received the attention of researchers in recent years. In the late 1980s, American climatologists M.D. Schwartz and T.R. Karl used the superimposed epoch method to study the climate before and after the leafing out of lilac plants in the spring in the U.S. Midwest. (This method uses time series data from multiple locations, which can be compared to one another by adjusting each data set around the respective onset date of lilac blooming.) In the illustration, the x-axis marks days before and after leafing, whereas the y-axis shows the related changes in the vapor pressure of the atmosphere. A second y-axis follows the day-by-day changes in minimum temperatures. Prior to the average date of leafing, the atmospheric humidity (vapor pressure) is relatively constant and minimum temperatures hover near freezing. At leafing, there is an abrupt increase in atmospheric humidity. Following leafing, daily minimum temperatures also increase abruptly. Although frosts are possible until June 10th in many parts of the Midwest, the chances of frost decline as the atmosphere is humidified.Climate and changes in the albedo of the surfaceThe amount of solar energy available at the surface for sensible and latent heating of the atmosphere depends on the albedo, or the reflectivity, of the surface. Surface albedos vary by location, season, and land cover type. The albedo of unvegetated ground devoid of snow ranges from 0.1 to 0.6 (10 to 60 percent), while the albedo of fully forested lands ranges from 0.08 to 0.15. An increase of 0.1 in regional albedo has been associated with a 20 percent decline in rainfall events connected with thunderstorms. Equivalent reductions in both evaporation and transpiration have also been reported in areas with sudden increases in albedo.The greatest changes in albedo occur in regions undergoing desertification and deforestation. Depending on the albedo of the underlying soil, reductions in vegetative land cover may give rise to albedo increases of as much as 0.2. Model studies of the vegetative zone known as the Sahel in Africa reveal that albedo increased from 0.14 to 0.35 due to desertification occurring during the 20th century. This coincided with a 40 percent decrease in rainfall. In addition, it is likely that the clearing of forests and prairies for agricultural crops over the past several hundred years has altered the albedo of extensive regions of the middle latitudes.Contemporary agricultural practices give rise to large variations in albedo from season to season as the land passes through the cycle of tilling, planting, crop growth, and harvest. At larger scales, an agricultural mosaic often emerges as each different plot of ground is covered by plantings of a single species. Viewed from the air, landscapes in the middle latitudes appear as a heterogeneous mix of forests, grasslands, meadows, water bodies, farmlands, wetlands, and urban types. The resultant patchiness in the landscape produces a patchiness in surface albedo. The mosaic of land use types creates a mix in the fluxes of sensible and latent heat to the atmosphere. Such changes to the heat flux have been shown to cause changes in the timing, intensity, and frequency of summer thunderstorms.The effect of vegetation patchiness on mesoscale climatesThe establishment of vegetation bands or patches 50 to 100 km (30 to 60 miles) in width in semiarid regions could increase atmospheric convection and precipitation beyond that expected over areas of uniform vegetation. This convection creates spatial differences in the upward and downward wind velocities and contributes to the development of mesoscale (20 to 200 km [12 to 120 miles]) circulation in the atmosphere (see Upper-level winds: Characteristics). For example, when creating models for forecasting atmospheric conditions on the Great Plains and along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, the mix of land cover and vegetation types must be specified to properly relate the fluxes of momentum and sensible and latent heat to the larger-scale circulation of the atmosphere. Proper calculations are also necessary to estimate rainfall. In addition, the specific location and hour of the day that thunderstorms occur depend on the heterogeneity of the vegetation cover of this region. Field observations have shown that the heterogeneity of surface roughness (small-scale irregularities in topography), soil moisture, forest coverage, and transpiration affect the location and pace of the formation of convective clouds and rainfall. Both convection and thunderstorm development tend to occur earlier in the day in heterogeneous landscapes.Biosphere controls on surface friction and localized windsAveraged annually over Earth's entire surface, the Sun provides about 345 watts per square meter of energy. About 30 percent of this energy is reflected away to space and is never used in the Earth-atmosphere system. Of that which remains, a little less than 1 percent (3.1 watts per square meter) accelerates the air by generating winds. An equal amount of energy must eventually be lost, or else wind speeds would perpetually increase.Earth as a thermodynamic system is dissipative the mechanical energy of the winds is eventually converted to heat through friction. Over the continents, it is the combination of terrain and the veneer of vegetation that offers the frictional roughness to dissipate the surface winds and convert this kinetic energy into heat. Marine winds approaching the British Isles average about 12 meters per second (27 miles per hour), but they are decelerated to 6 meters per second (13 miles per hour) because of the friction of the landscape's surface shortly after the winds make landfall. Without vegetation cover, the continents would offer much less friction to the wind, and wind speeds in unvegetated landscapes would be nearly twice as fast as those in vegetated landscapes.The correct specification of Earth's surface roughness due to vegetation, for use in computer models of the atmosphere, is critical to proper model performance. If the height of the terrain and vegetation are not specified correctly, the patterns of Earth's winds, global geography, and rainfall will be poorly modeled. When modeling newly desertified areas, such as the Sahel, it is important to understand that desertification creates vegetation of lower stature and thus lower surface roughness values. As a result, both wind velocities and wind direction could change from previous patterns over landscapes with taller vegetation.The extent of this impact of the biosphere on the atmosphere is revealed in climate model studies. One such study modeled the influence of reduced vegetation on surface roughness over the Indian subcontinent and provided evidence for a weaker monsoon and reduced rainfall. Given that much of the northwest third of India underwent a severe desertification and cultural collapse near the beginning of historical times, the role cultures play in vegetation reduction and climate change should not be ignored.The vegetation cover of the continents is not passive in response to the winds. Greenhouse-grown trees subjected to mechanical forces designed to mimic the winds lay down new woody tissue called reaction wood, which results in a stiffer tree over time. This material helps trees become more resilient and offer more frictional resistance to wind. This negative feedback, where increased winds result in stiffer vegetation and thereby subsequently reduced wind speeds, might well apply at the global scale by balancing the energy used to heat and accelerate the air (3.1 watts per square meter) with the surface friction needed to dissipate it.Biosphere impacts on precipitation processesCloud condensation nucleiThe formation and subsequent freezing of cloud droplets depend on the presence of cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei, respectively. Significantly, the biosphere is a major source of both of these kinds of nuclei. Over the continents, condensation nuclei are readily available and are of biogenic as well as anthropogenic origin. Examples of condensation nuclei include sea salt, small soil particles, and dust.As atmospheric convection increases with the heating of the day, cloud condensation nuclei are mixed into and above the planetary boundary layer and into the troposphere. In the bottom 0.5 km (the lowest 1,600 feet or so) of the atmosphere, nuclei typically number 2.2  1010 per cubic meter. In the next 0.5 km (between 1,600 and 3,300 feet) above, half as many nuclei are found. The number of condensation nuclei continues to decline with increased altitude. Furthermore, in general, the number of nuclei in the air over land is 10 times higher than over the oceans.Cloud condensation nuclei are generally abundant. They do not limit cloud formation over the continents; however, low numbers of condensation nuclei over the oceans may limit cloud formation there. In addition to natural sources, particulates from fuel combustion and sulfur dioxide gas resulting from high sulfur fuels also contribute to the load of condensation nuclei over the continents. Both the number and kind of condensation nuclei present in the atmosphere affect the cloudiness and the brightness of clouds in a given region. In this way, condensation nuclei play a significant role in determining both regional and global albedo.There is a type of condensation nuclei that forms in the marine air over the margins of continents. Though these nuclei are often few in number, they play a large role in cloud formation near the coasts of continents and may contribute significantly to both planetary albedo and global average temperature. Typically, sources of condensation nuclei in marine air are sulfate aerosols formed from the biogenic production of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) by marine algae. Given that DMS production increases with sea surface temperatures, a negative feedback may result. The central idea in this feedback hypothesis is that warmer waters result in the increased production of condensation nuclei by phytoplankton and thus produce more clouds. Increased cloudiness shades the ocean surface and results in lower temperatures that limit condensation nuclei production. It is estimated that a 30 percent increase in marine condensation nuclei would increase planetary albedo by 0.005 (0.5 percent) or produce a 0.7 percent reduction in solar radiation and a planetary average temperature decrease of 1.3 �C (2.3 �F). The sensitivity of this negative feedback on planetary temperatures remains in active debate.Biogenic ice nucleiAs water vapor condenses onto condensation nuclei, the droplets grow in size. Growth proceeds at relative humidity as low as 70 percent, but the rate of growth is very slow. Growth by condensation is most rapid where the air is slightly supersaturated with water vapor. At this point, cloud droplets typical of the size of fog droplets arise. Should temperatures fall to the level where freezing begins, the temperature difference between the droplet and the surrounding air (the vapor pressure deficit) strongly favours rapid condensation into the crystalline lattice of an ice particle. Ice particles that grow rapidly soon reach sizes where they begin to fall. As they fall, they collide and merge with smaller droplets and thereby grow larger.The formation of ice is of critical importance. A droplet of pure water, such as distilled water, will automatically freeze in the atmosphere at a temperature of 40 �C (40 �F). Freezing at warmer temperatures requires a substance upon which ice crystallization can take place. The common clay mineral kaolinite, a contaminant of the droplet, raises this freezing point to around 25 �C (13 �F). Furthermore, silver iodide, often used in cloud seeding to encourage rainfall, and sea salts also cause ice to form at 25 �C. Freezing at still warmer temperatures is most common with biogenic ice nuclei. Upon ice formation, heat energy on the order of 80 calories per gram of water frozen are released. This energy increases the sensible heat of the air and causes the air to become more buoyant. The process of ice formation encourages convection, cloudiness, and precipitation from clouds.The decomposition of organic matter is a major source of biogenic ice nuclei. Ice crystal formation has been shown to occur at temperatures as warm as 2 to 3 �C (28.5 to 26.6 �F) when biogenic ice nuclei are involved. The common freezing temperature for biogenic nuclei varies systematically according to biome and latitude. The coldest freezing-temperature nuclei occur above the tropics, whereas the warmest occur above the Arctic. Freezing produces greater buoyancy of the particles and helps them to reach higher vertical velocities within the clouds. The vertical motions and the larger droplet size that occur with biogenic materials favour the charge separation needed to produce lightning. Subsequently, oceanic areas with few biogenic ice nuclei are also areas of low lightning frequency. The production of biogenic nuclei from organic matter decomposition is greatest during the warm months when bacterial decomposition is greatest.Recycled rainfallThe water that is transpired into the atmosphere from the biosphere is eventually returned to the surface as precipitation. This vegetation-transpiration component of the hydrologic cycle is referred to as  recycled rainfall. While the oceans are the major source of atmospheric water vapor and rainfall, water from plant transpiration is also significant. For example, in the 1970s and '80s, analyses performed by American meteorologist Michael Garstang on the city of Manaus, Braz., in the Amazon basin revealed that around 20 percent of the precipitation came from water transpired by vegetation; the remaining 80 percent of this precipitation (an estimate made by German American meteorologist Heinz Lettau in the 1970s) was generated by the Atlantic Ocean. Isotopic studies of rainwater collected at various points in the Amazon basin indicated that nearly half of the total rain came from water originating in the ocean and half transpired through the vegetation. Evidence of the proportion of transpired water in rainfall reaching as high as 88 percent has been reported for the Amazon foothills of the Andes. General climate circulation models indicate that, without transpired water from plants, rainfall in the central regions of the continents would be greatly reduced. As a general rule, the farther the distance from oceanic water sources, the higher the fraction of rainwater originating from transpiration.Climate, humans, and human affairsIn the late 1960s and early '70s, climatologists envisioned the start of a new ice age because it was becoming clear that a cycle of planetary cooling was detected in the post-1940s record. The Central Intelligence Agency of the United States commissioned studies of the global political stresses that would ensue with a 1 �C (1.8 �F) temperature decline. The central question revolved around the locations of the political hot spots in a cooling world. The results of these studies were published under the title The Weather Conspiracy. In the late 1970s, Harvard University's Center for International Affairs addressed these issues in a book by English diplomat and environmentalist Crispin Tickell titled Climatic Change and World Affairs. Tickell sounded a warning:A shift of 2 �C in mean temperatures leads either to ice ages or to melting of the polar ice caps, either of which would destroy much of present civilization.In the late 1970s the global warming concerns arising from the burning of fossil fuels were still a decade away, but the Harvard report provided the impetus to research the possible links between the burning of fossil fuels and global warming. In academia during this time, climatologists and historians began working together to reexamine the past connections between climate and history.Since prehistoric times, humans have altered the land cover of the continents to suit their economic and cultural enterprises. In so doing, they have recast the two-way balance of mass and energy exchange between the atmosphere and the biosphere. Since the characteristics of Earth's climate in the absence of cities, agriculture, and other human land uses are unknown, comparing the dynamics of the present Earth-atmosphere system with that of preurban and preagricultural times is very difficult.In any case, humans are subject to the same climatic variations and changes that affect other life-forms. Food and fibre resources are climatically sensitive and vary in price accordingly. The cost of hauling coal by railroad depends on the temperature of the rails and on the weight gain that occurs when coal is wetted by rainfall. The consumption of fossil fuels for heating and cooling purposes is also climate-dependent. Damage from hurricanes, floods, droughts, snowstorms, tornadoes, and other weather phenomena have real costs. Climate conditions also affect decisions concerning travel and leisure.As an exceptionally adaptable species, humans are found in all corners of the planet save the coldest polar regions, highest mountain peaks, and lowest ocean troughs. As a result, there remain few places on Earth that are not in some respect aptly classified as human-dominated ecosystems. No region is untouched by human influence. The release of waste products from domestic and economic enterprises (burning fossil fuels, synthetic chemical use, trash production, etc.) alters the composition of the atmosphere, and gases and particulates related to these activities travel to all parts of the globe. In contrast, land clearing and development often permanently alter the surface of the planet and modify patterns of both surface heating and local weather. Economically, these enterprises are purposeful actions; however, they are inadvertent when it comes to the realized changes in the environment. Air pollution, ozone depletion, acid precipitation, global warming, desertification, smog production, and deforestation are but a few of the human impacts on the climate system that arise from the alteration of the mass and energy exchange with the atmosphere.The Gaia hypothesis, introduced at the beginning of this section, remains controversial in the scientific community. Nevertheless, the question of whether Homo sapiens possesses the capacity and the will to maintain the Earth-atmosphere system in a sort of relative homeostatic balance is intriguing. The Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer, which has resulted in the phasing out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), a group of industrial compounds that react with and disassociate ozone molecules, is a collective adaptive response by humans to a perceived and predicted threat to life from stratospheric ozone depletion. The Environmental Protection Acts ratified by the United Kingdom and Australia and the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are some examples of attempts to combat deleterious environmental change associated with the release of additional carbon dioxide into the air. If humans are to maintain the Earth-atmosphere system, it is through the social institutions of research and education that they will recognize environmental threats, come to wise decisions, and attempt to exercise stewardship of the planet.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://search.eb.com.turing.library.northwestern.edu/eb/print?articleId=37976&fullArticle=true&tocId=9037976<TEXT>a warming of the Earth's surface and troposphere (the lowest layer of the atmosphere), caused by the presence of water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and certain other gases in the air. Of these gases, known as greenhouse gases, water vapour has the largest effect.The atmosphere allows most of the visible light from the Sun to pass through and reach the Earth's surface. As the Earth's surface is heated by sunlight, it radiates part of this energy back toward space as infrared radiation. This radiation, unlike visible light, tends to be absorbed by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, raising its temperature. The heated atmosphere in turn radiates infrared radiation back toward the Earth's surface. (Despite its name, the greenhouse effect is different from the warming in a greenhouse, where panes of glass transmit visible sunlight but hold heat inside the building by trapping warmed air.)Without the heating caused by the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average surface temperature would be only about -18 �C (0 �F). On Venus the very high concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes an extreme greenhouse effect resulting in surface temperatures as high as 450 �C (840 �F).Although the greenhouse effect is a naturally occurring phenomenon, it is possible that the effect could be intensified by the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere as the result of human activity. From the beginning of the Industrial Revolution through the end of the 20th century, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increased 30 percent and the amount of methane more than doubled. A number of scientists have predicted that human-related increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases could lead to an increase in the global average temperature of 1.4 to 5.8 �C (2.5 to 10.4 �F) by the end of the 21st century. This global warming could alter the Earth's climates and thereby produce new patterns and extremes of drought and rainfall and possibly disrupt food production in certain regions. Other scientists involved in climatic research maintain that such predictions are overstated, however.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://search.eb.com.turing.library.northwestern.edu/eb/article-9066491<TEXT>any of four divisions of the year according to consistent annual changes in the weather. The seasons winter, spring, summer, and autumn are commonly regarded in the Northern Hemisphere as beginning on the winter solstice, December 22 or 23; the vernal equinox, March 20 or 21; the summer solstice, June 21 or 22; and the autumnal equinox, September 22 or 23, respectively (at the equinoxes, the days and nights are equal in length; at the winter solstice the day is the year's shortest, and at the summer solstice it is the year's longest). In the Southern Hemisphere, summer and winter are reversed, as are spring and fall.Outside the tropics and the polar regions, the essential characteristic of the annual cycle is a temperature oscillation between a single maximum and a single minimum. This oscillation results from the annual variation in the angle at which the Sun's rays reach the Earth's surface and from the annual variation in the duration of sunlight on the Earth's surface each day. As the Earth moves in its orbit around the Sun, its axis maintains a nearly constant orientation in space, inclined about 66�33� to the orbital plane. During the six-month half of each orbit when the North Pole is inclined toward the Sun, a point in the Northern Hemisphere receives the Sun's rays at an angle closer to 90� than does a point in the Southern Hemisphere; this causes greater heating and more hours of daylight in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere. During the other six months, these conditions are reversed. (See the Figure.)In polar latitudes, the seasons consist of a short summer and a long winter; this division is based primarily on sunlight, as there is continuous darkness all winter and continuous daylight or twilight all summer. In low latitudes, where the range of the annual insolation (receipt of solar radiation) and temperature cycle is very small, seasonal weather variations are based largely on rainy and dry periods. These moisture variations result from the movements of the intertropical convergence zone, a narrow belt of abundant precipitation that encircles the Earth near the equator. It shifts north and south seasonally with the Sun and causes the areas it crosses to have alternating wet and dry seasons; those regions very near the equator that are crossed twice each year by this belt have two wet and two dry seasons.In India, a marked seasonal alternation of rainfall and drought, caused by the monsoon, extends northward into latitudes where distinct temperature seasons also exist. The result is a cool, dry season from December through February; a hot, dry season from March through mid-June; and a rainy season from mid-June through November.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://search.eb.com.turing.library.northwestern.edu/eb/article-70019<TEXT>Pleistocene climates and the cause of the climatic cycles that resulted in the development of large-scale continental ice sheets have been a topic of study and debate for more than 100 years. Many theories have been proposed to account for Quaternary glaciations, but most are deficient in view of current scientific knowledge about Pleistocene climates. One early theory, the theory of astronomical cycles, seems to explain much of the climatic record and is considered by most to best account for the fundamental cause or driving force of the climatic cycles.The astronomical theory is based on the geometry of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, which affects how solar radiation is distributed over the surface of the planet. The latter is determined by three orbital parameters that have cyclic frequencies: (1) the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit (i.e., its departure from a circular orbit), with a frequency of about 100,000 years, (2) the obliquity, or tilt, of the Earth's axis away from a vertical drawn to the plane of the planet's orbit, with a frequency of 41,000 years, and (3) the precession, or wobble, of the Earth's axis, with frequencies of 19,000 and 23,000 years. Collectively these parameters determine the amount of radiation received at any latitude during any season; radiation curves have been calculated from them for different latitudes for the past 600,000 years. These curves vary systematically from the poles to the equator, with those in the higher latitudes being dominated by the 41,000-year tilt cycle and those in lower latitudes by the 19,000- and 23,000-year precession cycles. The astronomical theory places emphasis on summer insolation in the high-latitude areas of the Northern Hemisphere (about 55� N latitude). Glaciations are hypothesized to begin during times of low summer insolation when conditions should be most optimal for winter snow to last through the summer season.Dating of the marine terraces in Barbados and New Guinea and, more importantly, determining the chronology of glaciations as inferred from the marine oxygen isotope record were milestones in testing the astronomical theory. Early spectral analysis of the oxygen isotope record of cores from the deep ocean showed frequencies of climatic variation at essentially the same frequencies as the orbital cycles that is to say, at 100,000 years, 43,000 years, 24,000 years, and 19,000 years. These results (reported in 1976), along with those of more recent analyses, provide firm evidence of a tie between orbital cycles and the Earth's recent climatic record. The variations in the Earth's orbit are generally considered the pacemaker of the ice ages.Although the planetary orbital cycles are the likely cause of the Pleistocene climatic cycles, the mechanisms and connections to the global climate are not fully understood, and important questions remain unanswered. The relatively small seasonal and latitudinal radiation variations alone cannot account for the magnitude of climatic change as experienced by the Earth during the Pleistocene. Clearly, feedback mechanisms must operate to amplify the insolation changes caused by the orbital parameters. One of these is albedo, the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. Increased snow cover in high-latitude areas would cause increased cooling. Another feedback mechanism is the decreased carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere during times of glaciation, as recorded in the bubbles of long ice cores. Variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide are essentially synchronous with global climatic change and thus in all likelihood played a significant role through the so-called greenhouse effect. (The latter phenomenon refers to the trapping of heat that is to say, infrared radiation in the lower levels of the atmosphere by carbon dioxide, water vapour, and certain other gases.) Another atmospheric effect is the increased amount of dust during glacial times, as borne out by ice core and loess records. All of these changes operate in the same direction, causing increased cooling during glacial times and warming during interglacial times.Other problems remain with respect to the astronomical theory. One is the dominance of the 100,000-year cycle in the Pleistocene climatic record, whereas the eccentricity cycle is the weakest among the orbital parameters. Another is the cause of the asymmetrical pattern of the climatic record. Ice ages appear to start slowly and take a long time to build up to maximum glaciation, only to terminate abruptly and go from maximum glacial to full interglacial conditions in less than 10,000 years (see figure). A third problem is the synchronous nature of the climatic record between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, which one would not expect from the orbital parameters because they operate in different directions in the two hemispheres.Different approaches have been taken to explain these questions. Most of these suggest that the Northern Hemisphere with its enormous continental ice sheets was the controlling area and that the ice sheets themselves with their complex dynamics may explain the 100,000-year climatic cycle. Others propose that major reorganizations of the ocean atmosphere system must be called upon to explain the climatic record. These reorganizations are concerned with the transport of salt through the oceans and water vapor through the atmosphere and revolve around the existence and strength of deep oceanic currents in the Atlantic Ocean.Ongoing interdisciplinary research on Pleistocene paleoclimatology is focused on understanding the complex dynamics and interactions among the atmosphere, oceans, and ice sheets. Such research is expected to provide further insight into the cause of the climatic cycles, which is essential as scientists attempt to predict future climates in view of recent human-induced modifications of the climatic system.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.bartleby.com/65/cl/climate.html<TEXT>average condition of the atmosphere near the Earth�s surface over a long period of time, taking into account temperature, precipitation (see rain), humidity, wind, barometric pressure, and other phenomena. Primary Influence on ClimateThe major influence governing the climate of a region is its latitude. A broad latitudinal division of the Earth�s surface into climatic zones based on global winds includes the equatorial zone, or doldrums, characterized by high temperatures with small seasonal and diurnal change and heavy rainfall; the subtropical, including the trade-wind belts and the horse latitudes, a dry region with uniformly mild temperatures and little wind; the intermediate, the region of the prevailing westerlies that, because of several secondary influences, displays wide temperature ranges and marked changeability of weather; and the polar, a region of short summers and long winters, where the ground is generally perpetually frozen (see permafrost). The transitional climate between those of the subtropical and intermediate zones, known as the Mediterranean type, is found in areas bordering the Mediterranean Sea and on the west coasts of continents. It is characterized by mild temperatures with moderate winter rainfall under the influence of the moisture-laden prevailing westerlies and dry summers under the influence of the horse latitudes or the trade winds. Secondary Influences on ClimateThe influence of latitude on climate is modified by one or more secondary influences including position relative to land and water masses, altitude, topography, prevailing winds, ocean currents, and prevalence of cyclonic storms. Climatic types combining the basic factor of latitude with one or more secondary influences include the continental and the marine. Except in the equatorial region, the continental type is marked by dry, sunny weather with low humidity and seasonal extremes in temperature; noteworthy are the Sahara (with the highest temperature on record, 136�F, or 58�C, at Tripoli) and Siberia (with the lowest recorded surface temperature, -93.6�F, or -70�C, at Verkhoyansk). Marine climates are characterized by small annual and diurnal temperature variation and by copious rainfall on the windward side of coastal highlands and mountainous islands; notable is the mean annual precipitation of 451 in. (1146 cm) at Mt. Waialeale, Hawaii.The coastal, or littoral, climate is one in which the direction of the prevailing winds plays a dominant role the east coasts having generally the heavier rainfall in the trade-wind belts, the west coasts in westerly belts. Both coasts have a climate resembling the continental during the season when the wind is blowing from the interior of the continent. An instance of the coastal type, in which the precipitation is accentuated by the nearness of a mountain barrier, is the west coast of North America from Alaska to Oregon, where the mean annual precipitation averages 80 to 100 in. (203 to 254 cm), almost all of it falling during the winter months. Elevation is the dominant factor in mountain and plateau climates, with the temperature decreasing about 3�F per 1,000 ft (1.7�C per 305 m) of ascent and rainfall increasing with altitude up to about 6000 ft (1829 m), then decreasing with further elevation. Climatology and Climatic ChangeClimatology, the science of climate and its relation to plant and animal life, is important in many fields, including agriculture, aviation, medicine, botany, zoology, geology, and geography. Changes in climate affect, for example, the plant and animal life of a given area. The presence of coal beds in North America and Europe along with evidence of glaciation in these same areas indicates that they must have experienced alternately warmer and colder climates than they now possess.Despite yearly fluctuations of climatic elements, there has been, apparently, little overall change during the period of recorded history. Numerous climatic cycles (variations in weather elements that recur with considerable regularity) have been claimed to exist, including an 11-year cycle related to sunspot activity. There is currently much concern that human activities are changing the Earth's climate in harmful ways. Computer models of climate changes have been developed in recent years; some examine potential parameters that effect global warming or cooling.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.iki.rssi.ru/mirrors/stern/stargaze/Sseason.htm<TEXT>Stargazers and Skywatchers described the observed motion of the Sun across the sky, in different seasons of the year. This section tries to explain what is seen.  If the Earth's axis were perpendicular to the ecliptic, as in the drawings here, the Sun's position in the sky would be halfway between the celestial poles, and its daily path, seen from any point on Earth, would stay exactly the same, day after day.  Each point on Earth would be carried around the axis AB once a day. On the equator (point C) the sun would always rise until it was overhead, then again descend to the horizon. At the poles (A and B) it would always graze the horizon and never get away from it. Except at the pole, every point would be in the shadow half the time, when on the right of the line AB, and would experience night; the other half it would be in the sunlight, experiencing day. Because the motion is symmetric with respect to the line AB, day and night anywhere on Earth are always equal.  Actually, the axis of rotation makes an angle of about 23. 5 degrees with the direction perpendicular to the ecliptic. That makes life a lot more interesting.Equinox and Solstice  In particular (drawing above), the angle between the Earth's axis and the Earth-Sun line changes throughout the year. Twice a year, at the spring and fall equinox (around March 21 and September 22--the exact date may vary a bit) the two directions are perpendicular.  Twice a year, the angle is as big as it can get, at the summer and winter solstices, when it reaches 23.5 degrees. In the summer solstice (around June 21) the north pole is inclined towards the Sun, in the winter solstice (around December 21) it faces away from it.Let us look at the summer solstice first, with the Sun on the left.Summer and Winter  The boundary AB between sunlight and shadow--between day and night--is always perpendicular to the Earth-Sun line, as it was in the example shown at the beginning.  But because of the tilted axis, as each point on Earth is carried on its daily trip around the rotating Earth, the part of the trip spent in daylight (unshaded part of the drawing) and in the shadow (shaded) are usually not equal. North of the equator, day is longer than night, and when we get close enough to the north pole, there is no night at all. The Sun is then always above the horizon and it just makes a 360-degree circuit around it. That part of Earth enjoys summer.  A mirror-image situation exists south of the equator. Nights are longer than days, and the further one gets from the equator, the larger is the imbalance--until one gets so close to the pole that the sun never rises. That is the famous polar night, with 24 hours of darkness each day. In that half of the Earth, it is winter time.  Half a year later, the Earth is on the other side of the Sun, that is, the Sun's position in the above drawing should be on the right, and the shaded part of the Earth should now be on the left (light and dark portions in the drawing switch places). The Earth's axis however has not moved, it is still pointed to the same patch of sky, near the star Polaris. Now the south pole is bathed in constant sunshine and the north one is dark. Summer and winter have switched hemispheres.  A big difference between summer and winter is thus the length of the days: note that on the equator that length does not change, and hence Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter do not exist there (depending on weather patterns, however, there may exist a "wet season" and a "dry season"). In addition (as the drawing makes clear), the Sun's rays hit the summer hemisphere more vertically than the winter one. That, too, helps heat the ground, as explained further in section #4, "The Angle of the Sun's Rays."  At equinox, the situation is as in the first drawing, and night and day are equal (that is where the word "equinox" comes from)Some interesting facts  If June 21 is the day when we receive the most sunshine, why is it regarded as the beginning of summer and not its peak? And similarly, why is December 21, the day of least sunshine, the beginning of winter and not mid-winter day?  Blame the oceans, which heat up and cool down only slowly. By June 21 they are still cool from the winter time, and that delays the peak heat by about a month and a half. Similarly, in December the water still holds warmth from the summer, and the coldest days are still (on the average--not always! ) a month and a half ahead.  And what about our distance from the Sun? It, too, varies, because the Earth's orbit around the Sun isn't an exact circle. We are closest to the Sun--would you believe it? --in the cold wintertime, around January 3-5. This may have an interesting implication for the origin of ice ages, as will be explained later. It also ties to an interesting story of the unusually bright Moon of December 22, 1999.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/skytellers/seasons/activities/sequences.shtml<TEXT>In this traditional investigation of the causes of Earth's seasons, children model Earth's movement around our Sun using Styrofoam balls and flashlights and make observations about the changing distribution of light through our year. Begin the activity by asking why we have seasons (information can be found in About Seasons).

Have the children note their observations on a sheet of poster paper. What are the motions of Earth and our Sun that create the 24-hour day/night pattern we know on Earth? (Earth spinning, or rotating on its axis)Invite the children to experiment with their Styrofoam Earth and flashlight Sun to create the seasons in a way that explains what they know about Earth's seasons. One child will hold the Sun and another will move Earth. The other children in the group will evaluate the results and suggest model changes. How long does it take for Earth to go through a cycle of seasons or to go from one winter to the next? (One year) What changes as we go from summer to winter? (Day length decreases, temperatures get colder) Does winter in the northern hemisphere occur at the same time as winter in the southern hemisphere? (No, seasons are opposite in the northern and southern hemispheres; note that children can arrive at this conclusion in the activity) What motions of our Sun and Earth can the children propose that will explain these observations about the seasons on Earth?Are the children remembering to keep the Earth axis tilted? Does the direction of tilt change? (No, the axis always points in the same direction ? in the northern hemisphere, it currently points toward Polaris, the North Star)Draw the children's attention to the north polar region, where seasonal and day/night differences through the year are extreme. Do the children's models show the northern hemisphere getting sunlight full time during the northern hemisphere winter?They may be familiar with the fact that the north pole experiences months of darkness in the winter and months of daylight in the summer. Simply spinning on our axis does not explain months of darkness or light at the poles. The long polar night and day cycles also can help the children fix the direction of the axis so that it points consistently in a single direction for the movement of Earth around the Sun.Once the polar seasons are established, assist the children in noting other changes over the year. What is the relationship between our Sun and Earth in the northern hemisphere summer? Winter? Do the children's models explain the opposite seasons in the northern and southern hemispheres? What do the children observe about the direction of incoming solar rays in the winter and summer (They are in the same direction as the Earth's axis; the incoming rays are parallel to the plane in which Earth's axis lies) Where are the Sun's rays striking most directly in the northern hemisphere summer? (In the northern hemisphere) In the northern hemisphere winter? (In the southern hemisphere, during the southern hemisphere summer)Invite the children to model the slightly elliptical orbit. Ask them to describe what is happening to the seasons at the south and north polar regions. Does distance from our Sun influence Earth's seasons? [No. Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle, it is an ellipse, and our Sun is not exactly at the center of the ellipse. This means that sometimes Earth is farther from our Sun than at other times. Earth is closest to our Sun in January (147.5 million kilometers at perihelion) and the farthest away in July (152.5 million kilometers at aphelion). However, the difference in distances is so small, that it makes little difference in the winter and summer temperatures]Share with the children that on Earth's orbital path around our Sun, we are farthest from the Sun in July and closest in December, or just the opposite of what we might expect. Revisit the common misconception that distance from our Sun causes Earth's seasons, to make certain the children understand why this is not the case. Does distance alone ? without axial tilt ? explain the seasons? (NO! Without tilt, there are no seasons, and the northern and southern hemispheres would experience the same conditions at the same time.)If distance was the main factor then the northern hemisphere summer would occur when Earth is closest to our Sun (the opposite is true) and the northern and southern hemisphere winters and summers would not occur at different times.Invite the groups to demonstrate their models of the seasons and assess that each child understands that the annual pattern of seasons on Earth is caused by Earth's annual revolution around our Sun with its axis pointing to a fixed position in space.Explore equinoxes and solstices.Invite the children to model the solstices and equinoxes to check for comprehension about the seasons. Challenge them to illustrate the seasons for the southern hemisphere. When does the longest day of the year occur in the northern hemisphere? (In the summer) What do we call it? (Summer solstice, around June 21) What is the relationship between our Sun and Earth that makes this happen? (Our northern axis is tilted directly toward the Sun on that day of Earth's journey around the Sun) When does winter solstice occur in the northern hemisphere and what happens? (Around December 21 or 22 the northern hemisphere experiences the shortest day) Where is our northern hemisphere axis pointing? (Directly away from our Sun) The equinoxes are times of equal night (March 21 and 22 for northern hemisphere spring and September 22 and 23 for fall). Can the children show where equinoxes occur in their model?What happens with our Sun's rays in the spring and fall? (Incoming rays are perpendicular to the plane in which Earth's axis lies; all locations on Earth experience equal duration of daylight)</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate<TEXT>Climate is the average and variations of weather in a region over long periods of time. The climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, persistent ice or snow cover, as well as nearby oceans and their currents. Climates can be classified using parameters such as temperature and rainfall to define specific climate types. The most commonly used classification scheme is the one originally developed by Wladimir Koeppen. The Thornthwaite system,[1] in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration in addition to temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying animal species diversity and potential impacts of climate changes. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses defining the climate for certain areas.Paleoclimatology is the study and description of ancient climates using information from both non-biotic factors such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores, and biotic factors such as tree rings and coral, and can be used to extend back the temperature or rainfall information for particular locations to a time before various weather instruments were used to monitor weather conditions. Climate models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates and can be used to describe the likely patterns of future changes.Climate (from Ancient Greek klima) is commonly defined as the weather averaged over a long period of time.[2] The standard averaging period is 30 years,[3] but other periods may be used depending on the purpose. Climate also includes statistics other than the average, such as the magnitudes of day-to-day or year-to-year variations. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) glossary definition is:Climate in a narrow sense is usually defined as the average weather, or more rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.[4]The difference between climate and weather is usefully summarized by the popular phrase "Climate is what you expect, weather is what you get."[5] Over historical time spans there are a number of static variables that determine climate, including latitude, altitude, proportion of land to water, and proximity to oceans and mountains. Other climate determinants are more dynamic: for example, the thermohaline circulation of the ocean leads to a 5 �C (9 �F) warming of the northern Atlantic ocean compared to other ocean basins.[6] Other ocean currents redistribute heat between land and water on a more regional scale. The density and type of vegetation coverage affects solar heat absorption,[7] water retention, and rainfall on a regional level. Alterations in the quantity of atmospheric greenhouse gases determines the amount of solar energy retained by the planet, leading to global warming or global cooling. The variables which determine climate are numerous and the interactions complex, but there is general agreement that the broad outlines are understood, at least insofar as the determinants of historical climate change are concerned.[8]Climate classificationThere are several ways to classify climates into similar regimes. Originally, climes were defined in Ancient Greece to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and empiric methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the relative frequency of different air mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of empiric classifications include climate zones defined by plant hardiness,[9] evapotranspiration,[10] air mass origin, or more generally the K�ppen climate classification which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain biomes. A common shortcoming of these classification schemes is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.Bergeron and Spatial SynopticSource regions of global air massesMain article: Air massThe most generic classification is that involving the concept of air masses. The Bergeron classification is the most widely accepted form of air mass classification. Air mass classification involves three letters. The first letter describes its moisture properties, with c used for continental air masses (dry) and m for maritime air masses (moist). The second letter describes the thermal characteristic of its source region: T for tropical, P for polar, A for Arctic or Antarctic, M for monsoon, E for equatorial, and S for superior air (dry air formed by significant downward motion in the atmosphere). The third letter is used to designate the stability of the atmosphere. If the air mass is colder than the ground below it, it is labeled k. If the air mass is warmer than the ground below it, it is labeled w.[11] While air mass identification was originally used in weather forecasting during the 1950s, climatologists began to establish synoptic climatologies based on this idea in 1973.[12]Based upon the Bergeron classification scheme is the Spatial Synoptic Classification (SSC) system. There are six categories within the SSC scheme: Dry Polar (similar to continental polar), Dry Moderate (similar to maritime superior), Dry Tropical (similar to continental tropical), Moist Polar (similar to maritime polar), Moist Moderate (a hybrid between maritime polar and maritime tropical), and Moist Tropical (similar to maritime tropical, maritime monsoon, or maritime equatorial).[13]K�ppenAnnual average surface temperatures from 1961-1990. This is an example of how climate varies with location.Main article: K�ppen climate classificationThe K�ppen classification includes climate regimes such as Rain forest, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate, continental steppe, subarctic climate, tundra, polar ice cap, and desert. Rain forests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 1,750 millimetres (69 in) and 2,000 millimetres (79 in). Mean monthly temperatures exceed 18 �C (64 �F) during all months of the year.[14] A monsoon is a seasonal prevailing wind which lasts for several months, ushering in a region's rainy season.[15] Regions such as within North America, South America. Sub-Saharan Africa, Australia and East Asia to qualify as monsoon regimes.[16] A tropical savanna is a grassland biome located in semi-arid to semi-humid climate regions of subtropical and tropical latitudes, with average temperatures remain at or above 18 �C (64 �F) year round and rainfall between 750 millimetres (30 in) and 1,270 millimetres (50 in) a year. They are widespread on Africa, and are also found in India, the northern parts of South America, Malaysia, and Australia.[17] The humid subtropical climate zone where winter rainfall (and sometimes snowfall) is associated with large storms that the westerlies steer from west to east. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from occasional tropical cyclones.[18] Humid subtropical climates lie on the east side continents, roughly between latitudes 20� and 40� degress away from the equator.[19]Humid continental climate worldwideHumid continental climate is marked by variable weather patterns and a large seasonal temperature variance. Places with a hottest monthly temperature above 10 �C (50 �F) and a coldest month temperature below  3 �C (26.6 �F) and which do not meet the criteria for an arid climate, are classified as continental.[20] An oceanic climate is typically found along the west coasts at the middle latitudes of all the world's continents, and in southeastern Australia, and is accompanied by plentiful precipitation year round.[21] The Mediterranean climate regime resembles the climate of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of western North America, parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa and in parts of central Chile. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.[22] A steppe is a dry grassland with an annual temperature range in the summer of up to 40 �C (104 �F) and during the winter down to  40 �C (40.0 �F).[23] A subarctic climate has little precipitation,[24] and monthly temperatures which are above 10 �C (50 �F) for one to three months of the year, with continuous permafrost due to the very cold winters. Winters within subarctic climates include up to six months of temperatures averaging below 0 �C (32 �F).[25]Map of arctic tundraArctic tundra occurs in the far Northern Hemisphere, north of the taiga belt, including vast areas of northern Russia and Canada [26]. A polar ice cap, or polar ice sheet, is a high-latitude region of a planet or moon that is covered in ice. Ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy in the form of solar radiation from the sun than equatorial regions, resulting in lower surface temperatures.[27] A desert is a landscape form or region that receives very little precipitation. Deserts usually have a large diurnal and seasonal temperature range, with high daytime temperatures (in summer up to 45 �C or 113 �F), and low night-time temperatures (in winter down to 0 �C; 32 �F) due to extremely low humidity. Many deserts are formed by rain shadows, as mountains block the path of moisture and precipitation to the desert.[28]ThornthwaiteSee also: Microthermal, Mesothermal, and MegathermalThis climate classification method monitors the soil water budget using the concept of evapotranspiration.[10] It monitors the portion of total precipitation used to nourish vegetation over a certain area.[29] It uses indices such as a humidity index and an aridity index to determine an area's moisture regime based upon its average temperature, average rainfall, and average vegetation type.[30] The lower the value of the index is any given area, the drier the area is.The moisture classification includes climatic classes with descriptors such as hyperhumid, humid, subhumid, subarid, semi-arid (values of -20 to -40), and arid (values below -40).[31] Humid regions experience more precipitation than evaporation each year, while arid regions experience greater evaporation than precipitation on an annual basis. A total of 33 percent of the earth's landmass is considered either arid of semi-arid, including southwest North America, southwest South America, most of northern and a small part of southern Africa, southwest and portions of eastern Asia, as well as much of Australia.[32] Studies suggest that precipitation effectiveness (PE) within the Thornthwaite moisture index is overestimated in the summer and underestimated in the winter.[33] This index can be effectively used to determine the number of herbivore and mammal species numbers within a given area.[34] The index is also used in studies of climate change.[33]Thermal classifications within the Thornthwaite scheme include microthermal, mesothermal, and megathermal regimes. A mircothermal climate is one of low annual mean temperatures, generally between 0 �C (32 �F) and 14 �C (57 �F) which experiences short summers and has a potential evaporation between 14 centimetres (5.5 in) and 43 centimetres (17 in).[35] A mesothermal climate lacks persistent heat or persistent cold, with potential evaporation between 57 centimetres (22 in) and 114 centimetres (45 in).[36] A megathermal climate is one with persistent high temperatures and abundant rainfall, with potential evaporation in excess of 114 centimetres (45 in).[37]ModernInstrumental temperature record of the last 150 yearsDetails of the modern climate record are known through the taking of measurements from such weather instruments as thermometers, barometers, and anemometers during the past few centuries. The instruments used to study weather conditions over the modern time scale, their known error, their immediate environment, and their exposure have changed over the years, which must be considered when studying the climate of centuries past.[38]PaleoclimatologyMain article: PaleoclimatologyPaleoclimatology is the study of past climate over a great period of the Earth's history. It uses evidence from ice sheets, tree rings, sediments, coral, and rocks to determine the past state of the climate. It demonstrates periods of stability and periods of change and can indicate whether changes follow patterns such as regular cycles.[39]Climate changeVariations in CO2, temperature and dust from the Vostok ice core over the past 450,000 yearsSee also: Climate change, Global warming, temperature record, and attribution of recent climate changeClimate change refers to the variation in the Earth's global climate or in regional climates over time. It describes changes in the variability or average state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. These changes can be caused by processes internal to the Earth, external forces (e.g. variations in sunlight intensity) or, more recently, human activities.[40]In recent usage, especially in the context of environmental policy, the term "climate change" often refers only to changes in modern climate, including the rise in average surface temperature known as global warming. In some cases, the term is also used with a presumption of human causation, as in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC uses "climate variability" for non-human caused variations.[41]Earth has undergone periodic climate shifts in the past, including four major ice ages. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by interglacial periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface albedo, reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in greenhouse gases, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial. Suggested causes of ice age periods include the positions of the continents, variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and vulcanism.[42]Climate modelsSee also: Climate models and ClimatologyClimate models use quantitative methods to simulate the interactions of the atmosphere,[43] oceans, land surface and ice. They are used for a variety of purposes from study of the dynamics of the weather and climate system to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.The most talked-about models of recent years have been those relating temperature to the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide (see greenhouse gas). These models predict an upward trend in the global mean surface temperature, with the most rapid increase in temperature being projected for the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere.Models can range from relatively simple to quite complex:A simple radiant heat transfer model that treats the earth as a single point and averages outgoing energythis can be expanded vertically (radiative-convective models), or horizontallyfinally, (coupled) atmosphere-ocean-sea ice global climate models discretise and solve the full equations for mass and energy transfer and radiant exchange</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_sun_angle_on_climate<TEXT>Effect of sun angle on climateFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaThis diagram illustrates how sunlight is spread over a greater area in the polar regions. In addition to the density of incident light, the dissipation of light in the atmosphere is greater when it falls at a shallow angle.This is a diagram of the seasons. Regardless of the time of day (i.e. the Earth's rotation on its axis), the North Pole will be dark, and the South Pole will be illuminated; see also arctic winter.The amount of heat energy received at any location on the globe is a direct effect of sun angle of climate, as the angle at which sunlight strikes the earth varies by location, time of day, and season due to the earth's orbit around the sun and the earth's revolution around its tilted axis. Seasonal change in the angle of sunlight, caused by the tilt of the earth's axis, is the basic mechanism that results in warmer weather in summer than in winter.[1] Change in day length is another factor. (See also season.)Geometry of sun angleOne sunbeam one mile wide shines on the ground at a 90� angle, and another at a 30� angle. The one at a shallower angle covers twice as much area with the same amount of light energy.When sunlight shines on the earth at a lower angle (sun closer to the horizon), the energy of the sunlight is spread over a larger area, and is therefore weaker than if the sun is higher overhead and the energy is concentrated on a smaller area. (See Figure 2.)Figure 1 shows the angle of sunlight striking the earth in the Northern and equator when the earth's northern axis is tilted away from the sun.Figure 2 depicts a sunbeam one mile wide falling on the ground from directly overhead, and another hitting the ground at a 30� angle. Trigonometry tells us that the sine of a 30� angle is 1/2, whereas the sine of a 90� angle is 1. Therefore, the sunbeam hitting the ground at a 30� angle spreads the same amount of light over twice as much area (if we imagine the sun shining from the south at noon, the north-south width doubles; the east-west width does not). Consequently, the amount of light falling on each square mile is only half as much.The sunbeam entering at the shallower angle must also travel twice as far through the Earth's atmosphere, which reflects some of the energy back into space.Technical noteHeat energy is not received from the Sun. Radiant energy is received and this results in change in energy level of receiving bodies in Earth's domain. Different materials have different properties for transmitting back received energy in the form of heat energy at different rates. Concrete and tar for example are slow releasers. Most metals are fast releasers</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season<TEXT>A season is one of the major divisions of the year, generally based on yearly periodic changes in weather.Seasons happen due to the yearly revolution of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth's axis relative to the plane of revolution. In Temperate and Polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the amount of sunlight which may cause animals to go into hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant.The Northern hemisphere is closer to the sun at times of the year than the southern, it is exposed to more light causing summer to come into action at different times as the earth revolves.In temperate and polar regions generally four seasons are recognized: spring, summer, autumn, winter.In some tropical and subtropical regions it is more common to speak of the rainy (or wet, or monsoon) season versus the dry season, because the amount of precipitation may vary more dramatically than the average temperature. In other tropical areas a three-way division into hot, rainy and cool season is used. In some parts of the world, special "seasons" are loosely defined based upon important events such as a hurricane season, tornado season or a wildfire season.The seasons result from the Earth's axis being tilted to its orbital plane; it deviates by an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees. Thus, at any given time during summer or winter, one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the Sun (see Fig. 1). This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, the northern and southern hemispheres experience opposite seasons.It is easy to observe the effect of the axis tilt from the change in day length, and altitude of the Sun at noon (the culmination of the Sun), during a year.Seasonal weather differences between hemispheres are further caused by the elliptical orbit of Earth. Earth reaches perihelion (the point in its orbit closest to the Sun) in January, and it reaches aphelion (farthest point from the Sun) in July. Even though the effect this has on Earth's seasons is minor, it does noticeably soften the northern hemisphere's winters and summers. In the southern hemisphere, the opposite effect is observed.Seasonal weather fluctuations (changes) also depend on factors such as proximity to oceans or other large bodies of water, currents in those oceans, El Ni�o/ENSO and other oceanic cycles, and prevailing winds.In the temperate and polar regions, seasons are marked by changes in the amount of sunlight, which in turn often causes cycles of dormancy in plants and hibernation in animals. These effects vary with latitude and with proximity to bodies of water. For example, the South Pole is in the middle of the continent of Antarctica and therefore a considerable distance from the moderating influence of the southern oceans. The North Pole is in the Arctic Ocean, and thus its temperature extremes are buffered by the water. The result is that the South Pole is consistently colder during the southern winter than the North Pole during the northern winter.The cycle of seasons in the polar and temperate zones of one hemisphere is opposite to that in the other. When it is summer in the Northern hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern hemisphere, and vice versa.In the tropics, there is no noticeable change in the amount of sunlight. However, many regions (such as the northern Indian ocean) are subject to monsoon rain and wind cycles. A study of temperature records over the past 300 years[1] shows that the climatic seasons, and thus the seasonal year, are governed by the anomalistic year rather than the tropical year.In meteorological terms, the summer solstice and winter solstice (or the maximum and minimum insolation, respectively) do not fall in the middles of summer and winter. The heights of these seasons occur up to a month later because of seasonal lag. Seasons, though, are not always defined in meteorological terms.Compared to axial tilt, other factors contribute little to seasonal temperature changes. The seasons are not the result of the variation in Earth's distance to the sun because of its elliptical orbit.[2] Orbital eccentricity can influence temperatures, but on Earth, this effect is small and is more than counteracted by other factors; research shows that the Earth as a whole is actually slightly warmer when farther from the sun.[3] Mars however experiences wide temperature variations and violent dust storms every year at perihelion.[4]Polar day and nightAny point north of the Arctic Circle or south of the Antarctic Circle will have one period in the summer when the sun does not set, and one period in the winter when the sun does not rise. At progressively higher latitudes, the periods of "midnight sun" (or "midday dark" for the other side of the globe) are progressively longer. For example, at the military and weather station Alert on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island, Canada (about 450 nautical miles or 830 km from the North Pole), the sun begins to peek above the horizon in mid-February and each day it climbs higher and stays up longer; by 21 March, the sun is up for 12 hours. However, mid-February is not first light. The sky (as seen from Alert) has twilight, or at least a pre-dawn glow on the horizon, for increasing hours each day, for more than a month before the sun first appears.In the weeks surrounding 21 June, the sun is at its highest, and it appears to circle the sky without going below the horizon. Eventually, it does go below the horizon, for progressively longer periods each day until, around the middle of October, it disappears for the last time. For a few more weeks, "day" is marked by decreasing periods of twilight. Eventually, for the weeks surrounding 21 December, it is continuously dark. In later winter, the first faint wash of light briefly touches the horizon (for just minutes per day), and then increases in duration and pre-dawn brightness each day until sunrise in February.It is possible to explore interactively in this 3D season simulation, the main elements of this article such as:Effect of sun angle on climate,tilt of the earth's axe of poles,Polar day and nightEarth in 3D lightReckoningMeteorologicalMeteorological seasons are reckoned by temperature, with summer being the hottest quarter of the year and winter the coldest quarter of the year.Using this reckoning, the Roman calendar began the year and the spring season on the first of March, with each season occupying three months. This reckoning is also used in Denmark, the former USSR, and Australia. In the modern United Kingdom there are no hard and fast rules about seasons, and informally many people use this reckoning.So, in meteorology for the Northern hemisphere: spring begins on March 1, summer on June 1, autumn on September 1, and winter on December 1. Conversely, for the Southern hemisphere: summer begins on December 1, autumn on March 1, winter on June 1, and spring on September 1.AstronomicalIn astronomical reckoning, the seasons begin at the solstices and equinoxes. The cross-quarter days are considered seasonal midpoints. The length of these seasons is not uniform because of the elliptical orbit of the earth and its different speeds along that orbit.[citation needed]In the conventional United States calendar: Winter (89 days) begins on 21 December, the winter solstice; spring (92 days) on 20 March, the vernal equinox; summer (93 days) on 20 June, the summer solstice; and autumn (90 days) on 22 September, the autumnal equinox.[citation needed]Because of the differences in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, it is no longer considered appropriate to use the northern-seasonal designations for the astronomical quarter days. The modern convention for them is: March Equinox; June Solstice; September Equinox; and December SolsticeTraditionalTraditional seasons are reckoned by insolation, with summer being the quarter of the year with the greatest insolation and winter the quarter with the least. These seasons begin about 4 weeks earlier than the meteorological seasons and 7 weeks earlier than the astronomical seasons.In traditional reckoning, the seasons begin at the cross-quarter days. The solstices and equinoxes are the midpoints of these seasons. For example, the days of greatest and least insolation are considered the "midsummer" and "midwinter" respectively.This reckoning is used by various traditional cultures in the Northern Hemisphere, including East Asian and Irish cultures. In Iran, Afghanistan and some other parts of middle east the beginning of the astronomical spring is the beginning of the new year which is called Nowruz.AustraliaIn Australia, the traditional aboriginal people defined the seasons by what was happening to the plants, animals and weather around them. This led to each separate tribal group having different seasons, some with up to 8 seasons each year. However, most modern Aboriginal Australians follow the meteorological seasons as do non-Aboriginal Australians.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather<TEXT>The weather is a set of all the phenomena in a given atmosphere at a given time.[1] Weather phenomena lie in the hydrosphere and troposphere.[2][3] Weather refers to current activity, as opposed to the term climate, which refers to the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.[4] When used without qualification, "weather" is understood to be the weather of Earth.Weather occurs due to density (temperature and moisture) differences between one place to another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream. Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range 40 �C (72 �F) annually. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate.Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. The atmosphere is a chaotic system, so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to control the weather have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry has inadvertently modified weather patterns.Studying how the weather works on other planets has been helpful in understanding how weather works on Earth. A famous landmark in the Solar System, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years. However, weather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind.On Earth, common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere).[3] Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.[5]Weather occurs primarily due to density (temperature and moisture) differences between one place to another. These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics you lie, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due to the indirect sunlight.[6] The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the jet stream.[7] Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity).[8] Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes.Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate).[9] This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate (see Milankovitch cycles).[10]Uneven solar heating (the formation of zones of temperature and moisture gradients, or frontogenesis) can also be due to the weather itself in the form of cloudiness and precipitation.[11] Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes, which is explained by the lapse rate.[12][13] On local scales, temperature differences can occur because different surfaces (such as oceans, forests, ice sheets, or man-made objects) have differing physical characteristics such as reflectivity, roughness, or moisture content.Surface temperature differences in turn cause pressure differences. A hot surface heats the air above it and the air expands, lowering the air pressure and its density.[14] The resulting horizontal pressure gradient accelerates the air from high to low pressure, creating wind, and Earth's rotation then causes curvature of the flow via the Coriolis effect.[15] The simple systems thus formed can then display emergent behaviour to produce more complex systems and thus other weather phenomena. Large scale examples include the Hadley cell while a smaller scale example would be coastal breezes.The atmosphere is a chaotic system, so small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole.[16] This makes it difficult to accurately predict weather more than a few days in advance, though weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through the scientific study of weather, meteorology. It is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.[17] Chaos theory says that the slightest variation in the motion of the ground can grow with time. This idea is sometimes called the butterfly effect, from the idea that the motions caused by the flapping wings of a butterfly eventually could produce marked changes in the state of the atmosphere. Because of this sensitivity to small changes it will never be possible to make perfect forecasts, although there still is much potential for improvement.The sun and oceans can also affect the weather of land. If the sun heats up ocean waters for a period of time, water can evaporate. Once evaporated into the air, the moisture can spread throughout nearby land, thus making it cooler.Shaping the planet EarthMain article: WeatheringWeather is one of the fundamental processes that shape the Earth. The process of weathering breaks down rocks and soils into smaller fragments and then into their constituent substances.[18] These are then free to take part in chemical reactions that can affect the surface further (such as acid rain) or are reformed into other rocks and soils. In this way, weather plays a major role in erosion of the surface.[19]Effect on humansWeather has played a large and sometimes direct part in human history. Aside from climatic changes that have caused the gradual drift of populations (for example the desertification of the Middle East, and the formation of land bridges during glacial periods), extreme weather events have caused smaller scale population movements and intruded directly in historical events. One such event is the saving of Japan from invasion by the Mongol fleet of Kublai Khan by the Kamikaze winds in 1281.[20] French claims to Florida came to an end in 1565 when a hurricane destroyed the French fleet, allowing Spain to conquer Fort Caroline.[21] More recently, Hurricane Katrina redistributed over one million people from the central Gulf coast elsewhere across the United States, becoming the largest diaspora in the history of the United States.[22]Though weather affects people in drastic ways, it can also affect the human race in simpler ways. The human body is negatively affected by extremes in temperature, humidity, and wind.[23] Mood is also affected by the weather.[24]ForecastingMain article: Weather forecastingForecast of surface pressures five days into the future for the north Pacific, North America, and north Atlantic ocean.Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a future time and a given location. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennia, and formally since at least the nineteenth century.[25][26] Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve.[27]Once an all human endeavor based mainly upon changes in barometric pressure, current weather conditions, and sky condition,[28][29] forecast models are now used to determine future conditions. Human input is still required to pick the best possible forecast model to base the forecast upon, which involves pattern recognition skills, teleconnections, knowledge of model performance, and knowledge of model biases. The chaotic nature of the atmosphere, the massive computational power required to solve the equations that describe the atmosphere, error involved in measuring the initial conditions, and an incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes mean that forecasts become less accurate as the difference in current time and the time for which the forecast is being made (the range of the forecast) increases. The use of ensembles and model consensus help narrow the error and pick the most likely outcome.[30][31][32]There are a variety of end users to weather forecasts. Weather warnings are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property.[33] Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture,[34][35][36][37] and therefore to commodity traders within stock markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days.[38][39][40] On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and the wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them.ModificationThe wish to control the weather is evident throughout human history: from ancient rituals intended to bring rain for crops to the U.S. Military Operation Popeye, an attempt to disrupt supply lines by lengthening the North Vietnamese monsoon. The most successful attempts at influencing weather involve cloud seeding; they include the fog- and low stratus dispersion techniques employed by major airports, techniques used to increase winter precipitation over mountains, and techniques to suppress hail.[41]Whereas there is inconclusive evidence for these techniques' efficacy, there is extensive evidence that human activity such as agriculture and industry results in inadvertent weather modification:[41]Acid rain, caused by industrial emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, adversely effects freshwater lakes, vegetation, and structures.Anthropogenic pollutants reduce air quality and visibility.Climate change caused by human activities that emit greenhouse gases into the air is expected to affect the frequency of extreme weather events such as drought, extreme temperatures, flooding, high winds, and severe storms.[42]The effects of inadvertent weather modification may pose serious threats to many aspects of civilization, including ecosystems, natural resources, food and fiber production, economic development, and human health.[43].Extremes on EarthOn Earth, temperatures usually range 40 �C (72 �F) annually. The range of climates and latitudes across the planet can offer extremes of temperature outside this range. The coldest air temperature ever recorded on Earth is 89.2 �C (129 �F), at Vostok Station, Antarctica on 21 July 1983. The hottest air temperature ever recorded was 57.7 �C (135.9 �F) at Al 'Aziziyah, Libya, on 13 September 1922.[44] The highest recorded average annual temperature was 34.4 �C (93.9 �F) at Dallol, Ethiopia.[45] The coldest recorded average annual temperature was 55.1 �C (67 �F) at Vostok Station, Antarctica.[46] The coldest average annual temperature in a permanently inhabited location is at Eureka, Nunavut, in Canada, where the annual average temperature is Extraterrestrial with the Solar SystemStudying how the weather works on other planets has been seen as helpful in understanding how it works on Earth.[48] Weather on other planets follows many of the same physical principles as weather on Earth, but occurs on different scales and in atmospheres having different chemical composition. The Cassini-Huygens mission to Titan discovered clouds formed from methane or ethane which deposit rain composed of liquid methane and other organic compounds.[49] Earth's atmosphere includes six latitudinal circulation zones, three in each hemisphere.[50] In contrast, Jupiter's banded appearance shows many such zones,[51] Titan has a single jet stream near the 50th parallel north latitude,[52] and Venus has a single jet near the equator.[53]One of the most famous landmarks in the Solar System, Jupiter's Great Red Spot, is an anticyclonic storm known to have existed for at least 300 years.[54] On other gas giants, the lack of a surface allows the wind to reach enormous speeds: gusts of up to 600&nsbp;metres per second (about 2,100 kilometres per hour (1,300 mph)) have been measured on the planet Neptune.[55] This has created a puzzle for planetary scientists. The weather is ultimately created by solar energy and the amount of energy received by Neptune is only about 1/900th of that received by Earth, yet the intensity of weather phenomena on Neptune is far greater than on Earth.[56] The strongest planetary winds discovered so far are on the extrasolar planet HD 189733 b, which is thought to have easterly winds moving at more than 9,600 kilometres per hour (6,000 mph).[57]Space weatherWeather is not limited to planetary bodies. A star's corona is constantly being lost to space, creating what is essentially a very thin atmosphere throughout the Solar System. The movement of mass ejected from the Sun is known as the solar wind. Inconsistencies in this wind and larger events on the surface of the star, such as coronal mass ejections, form a system that has features analogous to conventional weather systems (such as pressure and wind) and is generally known as space weather. Coronal mass ejections have been tracked as far out in the solar system as Saturn.[58] The activity of this system can affect planetary atmospheres and occasionally surfaces. The interaction of the solar wind with the terrestrial atmosphere can produce spectacular aurorae,[59] and can play havoc with electrically sensitive systems such as electricity grids and radio signals</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/weather/<TEXT>Australian weather and the seasonsA photo of Santa arriving at the beach by boat. Image courtesy of the National Archives of Australia: A1500, K26950.Like all countries in the southern hemisphere (the hemisphere south of the Equator), Australia's seasons follow the sequence:Summer: December to FebruaryAutumn: March to MayWinter: June to AugustSpring: September to NovemberThis means that the Australian Christmas takes place at the height of summer. It also means that the mid-year break for students happens in winter. The end of year break for students is commonly known as the 'summer holidays', or the 'Christmas holidays'.Even though the four 'official' calendar seasons have the same names as the northern hemisphere seasons, the weather during these seasons is very different to northern hemisphere weather patterns. Australia is generally a very dry place, so summers can get much hotter. The pattern of rainfall is also distinct - some places have abundant rain at one time of the year and almost none at other times.Indigenous Australians have long had their own seasonal calendars, which are different from the seasonal calendar brought to Australia by the British in 1788. For example, the Jawoyn, from the Northern Territory, recognize six seasons. Jiorrk, the wet season, lasts from January to February. Bungarung, the end of the rains, lasts from March to mid-April. Jungalk, the hot start of the dry period, lasts from mid-April to the end of May. Malaparr, the cooler, middle part of the dry period, lasts from June to the end of August. Worrwopmi, the humid time, lasts from September to the end of October. Wakaringding, the humid time when the first rains begin to fall, lasts from November until the end of December.All different kinds of weatherBecause Australia is such a large country, its weather varies significantly in different parts of the continent. Living in Australia can involve everything from sunbathing on the beach in scorching summers to knocking snow off your boots after a day of skiing and from sweating out the humidity during the build-up at the beginning of the wet season, to wrapping up snug and waiting at the bus stop in the pouring rain.In the north there are tropical regions with high temperatures and high humidity and distinct wet and dry seasons. In the centre of the country are dry, desert regions with high daytime temperatures and low amounts of rain. In the south are the temperate regions with moderate rainfall and temperatures ranging from hot to cold.The temperature in Australia changes with the seasons, but in general it ranges between highs of 50 degrees Celsius to lows of sub-zero temperatures. The lowest temperatures reached in Australia, however, are not comparable to the extreme lows experienced in other continents. This is partly because Australia lacks very high mountains and enjoys the presence of warming oceans around its coastal regions.Australia's tropical regionsThe tropical regions of Australia are in the north of the country. They include the central and northern parts of the Northern Territory and Queensland, and the northern parts of Western Australia. The weather in the Australian tropics has two very different seasons: the wet season and the dry season.The wet season lasts about six months in summer and spring, between December and March. It is hotter than the dry season, with temperatures between 30 and 50 degrees Celsius. This is because of the high humidity during the wet, which is caused by large amounts of water in the air. During the wet there is a lot of rain, which frequently causes flooding.The dry season lasts about six months in autumn and winter, usually between May and October. Temperatures are lower and the skies are generally clearer during the dry. The average temperature is around 20 degrees Celsius.The 'build up' is the humid time of year between the wet and dry seasons. It usually lasts for three or four months. Things become quite tense during the 'build up' as people sit and swelter in the humidity while waiting and hoping for the first rains to come. The humidity continues day and night with no respite, so when the rains finally do come everyone enjoys their cooling relief.Australia's dry regionsThe driest regions of Australia are found mostly in central Australia, stretching from most of central and southern Western Australia, through the southern parts of the Northern Territory and most of South Australia, to the far west regions of Queensland and New South Wales, and the north-western parts of Victoria.The dry and desert regions of Australia are characterised by intense heat during the day and intense cold at night. Temperatures range from around 40 degrees celsius in the summer to between 16 and 24 degrees celsius in the winter. At night the temperature can vary from 19 degrees Celsius to zero degrees Celsius These areas receive little rainfall. Most of central Australia is normally in a state of drought.Australia's temperate regionsThe temperate areas of Australia are found on the south-eastern coast, reaching south from Tasmania through most of Victoria and New South Wales into the southern parts of Queensland. Temperate regions are also found in the southern most parts of South Australia and the south-western tip of Western Australia.The weather in temperate Australia is quite changeable throughout the year, with an average temperature of around 30 degrees Celsius in the summer, and cool to cold winters with an average temperature of around 15 degrees Celsius. The summer frequently extends into periods of heat wave and drought, while the winters, while usually cold, wet and windy, are quite mild in comparison to winters in many European countries.Snow is uncommon in temperate Australia, and unheard of in the dry and tropical regions, but along the Great Dividing Range, the mountain range that passes through New South Wales and Victoria, there are regular winter snowfalls.Living with Australian weatherDroughtAustralia is the driest inhabited continent. As a consequence, water is a very precious resource to Australians. As well as having an unpredictable and varied rainfall pattern, Australia often experiences serious droughts.A drought is an unusually long period of time when there is not enough water for people to use in the way they normally would. There have been many serious droughts in Australia in the last 200 years. The 1895-1903 drought lasted eight years and caused the death of half of Australia's sheep and forty per cent of its cattle. The 1963-68 drought caused a forty per cent reduction in wheat crops across Australia. In central Australia that same drought actually lasted eight years, from 1958 to 1967.Generally speaking, for every ten years in Australia there are three years during which water supply is good, and three years during which water supply is bad. Drought affects farming practices and can pose long-term threats to the environment. Droughts affect the sustainability of agriculture, threaten the life cycles of plants and animals, increase the chance that toxic algae outbreaks will happen, and also increase the chance of dust-storms and bushfires.In times of drought, water restrictions are put in place. These restrictions place limits on the amount of water that people can use. In farming areas, restrictions limit the amount of water farmers can use to water their crops or give to their stock to drink, as well as how much water they can use for their own personal needs. In urban areas, restrictions limit the way that people use water for showering and baths, for watering their gardens, and even for washing their cars.BushfiresAustralia's weather also contributes to bushfires. Bushfires are large, out of control fires that occur in Australia's bushland. The Australian summer is characterized by low humidity, high winds and low rainfall. Sunshine and high temperatures make trees and grass very dry and very easy to burn. Most Australian native plants burn quickly and easily. Eucalyptus trees have a lot of oil occurring naturally in them, which makes them especially dangerous in a bushfire.There have been many severe bushfires in Australia's history. These fires have resulted in the loss of many lives and millions of dollars in property damage. In 1967, a huge fire burnt over 250,000 hectares of land in southern Tasmania in five hours, reaching as far as the outskirts of Hobart. In February 1983, around 180 bushfires were burning in Victoria and South Australia. In total, the fires burnt out over one million hectares and resulted in the death of 76 people. This devastating series of fires came to be known as 'Ash Wednesday'. In 2003, bushfires swept through the outer suburbs of Canberra, Australia's capital, killing 4 people and injuring many others, destroying more than 500 houses and forcing whole suburbs to be evacuated.Living with bushfire is part of the Australian way of life. Most Australian states and territories have a volunteer country fire service, for example, the Victorian Country Fire Authority, the South Australian Country Fire Service and the New South Wales Rural Fire Service. These are important volunteer organisations that help to fight alongside professional fire fighters when bushfires strike. Many Australians give up their time to learn how to fight bushfires so that they are ready when the fires occur. Bushfire prevention methods are also taught to everyone in Australia from a very young age.CyclonesCyclones are a tropical weather phenomenon. They are usually encountered in Australia between November and April, and they mostly take place in the north of the country. The Western Australian and Northern Territory coasts, as well as the Queensland coast, are the usual places that cyclones occur.About six cyclones happen in Australia every year. By far the most famous cyclone in Australia is Cyclone Tracy, which hit Darwin in the Northern Territory on Christmas Day. Forty-nine people died as a result, and over 600 people were injured. Darwin had to be evacuated because over eighty per cent of the city was destroyed. But Tracy is not the worst cyclone to ever visit Australia. In 1899, Cyclone Mahina killed over 400 people when it destroyed an entire pearl-fishing fleet at Bathurst Bay in Queensland.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/badseasons.html<TEXT>The seasons begin at the time of the solstice or equinox.I think I will break from my usual format of Bad Astronomy/Good Astronomy by saying that the way we define seasons currently is not strictly bad, but I feel (in my opinion!) that it could be better. The definition of when the seasons begin is at the moment of solstice or equinox; that is, winter (in the north) starts on December 22nd and summer starts on June 22nd. I feel instead that the midpoint of the seasons are really at these times. The seasons themselves start a month and a half before then.How it works: During a local news broadcast, they said that winter begins in December. I prefer to think that the Winter Solstice is in December, and winter itself started a month and half earlier. We will need to have a few definitions here, so hang on!First off, I am in the Northern hemisphere, so I will make all my descriptions using that reference. I apologize to my Southern readers; just reverse the references to the seasons (i.e., replace "winter" with "summer") and it should straighten things out.The Earth orbits the Sun in one year (by definition!). The seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth to the plane of its orbit. The Earth is tilted about 23 degrees, so that sometimes the North pole is tipped toward the Sun, and other times the South pole is pointed more toward the Sun. From here on the Earth, this means the Sun moves north and south about 46 degrees over the course of the year. In the summer, the Sun is very high in the sky, but in the winter it never gets as high; the difference is that very same 46 degrees (about 1/4 of the way around the visible part of the sky!).Now imagine breaking up the Sun's 46 degree up-and-down yearly swing into 1 day intervals. Start at the top; then 3 months later it is midway between extremes and heading south, then 3 months after that it is at the lowest point (6 months after the peak). After that, it starts heading back up; three months later it is at the midway point on its way up. A full year after we start, it is back at the top of its journey. We have names for these four times; in order, they are the Summer Solstice, the Autumnal (or Fall) Equinox, the Winter Solstice, and the Spring (or Vernal) Equinox).Now, bear with me: if summer started at the moment the Sun hit its peak, then every day of summer would mean the Sun gets a little lower in the sky. This to me doesn't make sense. You want the Sun to hit its peak at summer's midpoint, meaning summer would start 1.5 months earlier. That way the Sun would be climbing steadily higher until the peak of summer, then start to fall. This would in turn mean that the Sun hits its nadir (lowest point) in the middle of winter, and not at winter's beginning! See?As it happens, a lot of countries do actually think of the seasons this way; Japan for example. A lot of European countries do too; they have a Midsummers Day (made famous by William Shakespeare) on June 21 or so, and the days I claim should be the actual season starters are called "cross-quarter" days. I'll note that I didn't know this when I started the page. I'll also note that the email I get complaining about my opinion on this is overwhelmingly from people in the US, who also use weather as an argument. I specifically say here that I am avoiding using weather in my reasoning. Also, the email that supports my idea usually comes from outside the US boundaries.The length of the day depends on this effect as well. When the Sun is at the peak of its path, the day is at its longest (think of it this way: it has more distance to travel to get across the sky!). When the Sun is at its lowest, the day is shortest. It makes far more sense to me to have the longest day of the year at mid-summer, and not the first day, much as the shortest day should be mid-winter.There is one major drawback with this definition of the seasons. Most people like to base definitions on something, well-- definite. That's probably the reason we define the seasons at such specific, easily measured dates. My definition would change that so that the mid-season is defined at these times, and thus the beginnings of the seasons would not have such a definite start and stop.The point I am trying to make here is that the seasons are defined by an astronomical event-- the crossing of the Sun over the Celestial Equator (see below). This event does not really tie into the weather at all: by December where I live, things have been cold for over a month and will stay that way for at least two more! So I am trying to avoid the whole issue of weather and simply say that the definition of seasons -- while fine in and of itself-- could be tied into our daily lives better by using the length of the day as a guide.This makes some people uncomfortable, as my email has been telling me! Still, I am not trying to change the world here-- just pointing out that maybe our current definition needs some background to explain why we chose it. Now mind you, I don't have a lot of scientific backing on this claim, just my own personal feelings on symmetry, beauty and common sense.I have received quite a bit of mail about this. The messages tend to fall into two groups: one uses weather as a guide to the seasons, and the other talks about definitions. Let me make this clearer now: I am talking about the somewhat arbitrary definition of seasons, not the climatic effects. Temperature changes with seasons are highly latitude-dependent: someone in Ecuador, for example, sees little temperature change year round, while in Washington DC (trust me here!) the change is dramatic (well over 30 degrees Centigrade). So I am avoiding that issue completely. The actual definition of seasons is purely astronomical: the Equinoxes are defined as the two points on the sky where the path of the Earth around the Sun (the ecliptic) intersects the projected equator of the Earth on the sky (the Celestial Equator or CE). These two points are generically called nodes. As the Sun travels around the ecliptic it moves generally in an East/West direction, with some small North/South motion due to the inclination of the ecliptic to the CE. When the Sun hits the Vernal Equinox, it is moving North (on its way up in the sky as I discussed above). Six months later, it is moving South (on its way down) when it reaches the Autumnal Equinox. At the Summer Solstice the Sun has reached its highest point (the farthest North of the CE), and at the Winter Solstice its lowest point (the farthest South of the CE). That is how the seasons are actually defined! (phew!) I know this is confusing and awful without a diagram, but I don't have good software yet to make the diagrams I need for this page. I will include them as soon as I can draw them!</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/skytellers/day_night.shtml<TEXT>Why does Earth have day and night?Day and night cycles are caused by Earth's spin on its axis. Earth turns or rotates one time every 24 hours. The part of Earth that is facing the Sun experiences day, and the part facing away from the Sun experiences night. As Earth spins counterclockwise (viewed from above the North Pole) the region of daylight moves across the globe from east to west.Do other planets have day and night?All the planets in the solar system spin on their axes (so does the Sun!) and so they have day and night cycles. There are differences, however, in the length of day and night. Some planets rotate faster than Earth and some rotate slower. Mars has a day/night cycle similar to Earth. Mars rotates on its axis once every 24.6 hours. Venus turns once on its axis every 243 Earth days (which is a little longer than it takes for Venus to go around the Sun!). The larger planets spin much faster. Jupiter rotates once every 10 hours, Saturn spins once every 11 hours, and Neptune completes a rotation in 16 hours. Pluto, at the farthest reaches of the solar system, spins on its axis once every 6.4 days.Why does Earth's day length change during the year?Every location on Earth experiences an average of 12 hours of light per day, but the actual number of hours of daylight on any particular day of the year varies from place to place. Locations around Earth's equator receive about 12 hours of light each day. In contrast, the North Pole receives 24 hours of daylight for a few months in the summer and total darkness for months in the winter. These two annual times of light and dark are separated by a long sunrise and a long sunset.Earth rotates on its axis; this causes us to experience day and night. But Earth's axis is tilted 23.5 degrees (the angle is measured between Earth's equatorial plane and the plane in which it orbits the Sun). As Earth revolves around the Sun, the axis points toward the same location in space, almost directly toward Polaris, the North Star. This means that during our movement around their Sun each year, our polar regions spend long periods pointed toward the Sun in the summer (for example, July in the Northern Hemisphere, or December in the Southern Hemisphere) and long periods pointed away from the Sun during the winter. At latitudes greater than 66.5 degrees (90 degrees minus 23.5, the tilt of the axis), the regions above the Arctic and Antarctic circles on our globe, days of constant darkness or light can occur.Because of this tilt and our movement around the Sun, there is a time when Earth's North Pole is tilting 23.5 degrees toward the Sun. This is the Summer Solstice, the first day of the Northern Hemisphere summer and the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. On December 21 or 22, our North Pole is tilting 23.5 degrees away from the Sun and the South Pole is tilted toward the Sun. This is the Winter Solstice, the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. Twice each year, during the Equinoxes (equal nights), Earth's axis is not pointed toward the Sun. The Spring Equinox in March marks the beginning of the transition from 24 hours of darkness to 24 hours of daylight at the North Pole. The Fall Equinox in September marks the shift into 24 hours of darkness at the North Pole. During the Equinoxes, every location on Earth (excluding the extreme poles) experiences a 12-hour day time period.Other planets also experience these changes in the length of day and night because they, too, are tilted on their axes. Each planet's axis is tilted at a different angle. Jupiter is tilted only 3 degrees, so its change in the lengyh of day and night as it moves around the Sun is less extreme than that of Earth. Neptune's axis is tilted 30 degrees; day and night changes would be more extreme on Neptune than on Earth. Uranus presents an interesting case because its axial tilt is even more extreme, 98 degrees! This means that the north pole of Uranus is pointed at the Sun during the north polar summer; the south pole is in total darkness. During the north pole winter, some 42 Earth years later, the south polar axis points at the Sun and the north polar region is in total darkness. During the spring and fall, when its axis is perpendicular to the incoming rays of the Sun, Uranus experiences a 17-hour day and night cycle as it spins on its axis.Good news for overachievers: Earth's days are getting longer!Researchers examining ancient corals noted that annual growth patterns suggested there were more days in a year in Fossil corals from the Devonian Period (380 million years ago) recorded 400 daily cycles. About 290 million years ago in the Pennsylvanian Period, there were 390 daily cycles each year. Assuming that Earth's revolution around the Sun has not changed dramatically, this means that the number of hours per day has been increasing and that Earth's rotation has been slowing. Today, the length of a day is 24 hours. During the Pennsylvanian Period a day was ~22.4 hours long. In the Devonian Period, a day was ~21.8 hours long. Earth's rotation appears to be slowing approximately 2 seconds every 100,000 years. Why are Earth days getting longer? Some scientists suggest that tidal cycles create a drag on Earth, causing it to slow down.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/skytellers/sun.shtml<TEXT>The Sun is our nearest star. Its light and heat make life on Earth possible.When did the Sun form? Scientists calculate the Sun and solar system formed at approximately the same time, 4.55 billion years ago. This is based on the ages of the oldest objects that we have sampled from our solar system, meteorites.How did the Sun form? The solar nebula theory describes how most scientists think the Sun formed. A cloud of hydrogen and helium gas and dust existed in space. It began to compress and eventually gravitational forces pulled the gas and dust together and the cloud collapsed. The collapsing cloud began spinning and flattening into a disk. Much of the material was concentrated in the center of the spinning mass, where compression resulted in a protosun of increasing density and temperature. Eventually the heat and pressure increased to the point where nuclear fusion of hydrogen occurred and the Sun ignited. By exploring our universe with tools such as the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists have discovered stars in various stages of formation predicted by the solar nebular theory.How much longer will the Sun shine? Scientists predict the Sun will shine for another 7 billion years! They arrive at this estimate by calculating how fast the hydrogen in the Sun's core is being converted to helium. Approximately 37% of the Sun's hydrogen has been used since the time of its formation, 4.55 billion years ago. (Lang, 1999)How big is the Sun? The Sun's diameter is 1,391,020 kilometers, or about 109 times the diameter of Earth.Structure of the SunLike Earth, the Sun has many different layers. Unlike Earth, the Sun is made of gas!The Sun's energy is generated in its core. Gravitational pressures compress and heat the material in the core to over 15 million degrees Celsius!Energy passes from the core into the cooler radiative zone (5 million degrees Celsius). Here the energy (radiation) moves randomly from atom to atom, with some of the energy moving toward the Sun's surface.As energy moves out of the radiative zone, it enters the convective zone. Here the atoms do not pass the energy from particle to particle; the atoms themselves move, carrying the heat with them. The hotter material near the radiative zone rises to the cooler surface of the convective zone. As it reaches the top of the convective zone, it cools and sinks.The photosphere (sphere of light) is the surface of the Sun; because the Sun is made of gas, it does not have a solid surface. The photosphere has temperatures that reach about 5800 degrees Kelvin and is the layer that releases most of the light that reaches Earth.The surface of the Sun has continuously changing dark regions or sunspots. The spots are dark because they are cooler than the surrounding gas (about 3230 degrees Celsius). Sunspots can persist for an hour to several months. The number of sunspots increases and decreases in an 11-year cycle, the solar cycle.The photosphere and sunspots can be viewed safely with special solar telescopes, but not directly with the human eye!The chromosphere (sphere of color) is a 2000-kilometer-thick layer of gas that reaches temperatures between 6000 and 50,000 degrees Celsius. Most of the energy from the chromosphere is released as red light, which means that the chromosphere can be viewed with special telescopes that filter out the other wavelengths. The chromosphere is dynamic; convection cells swirl the surface, and material shoots off the surface as flame-like features.The corona is a thin outer layer of the Sun that is seen during a solar eclipse. The corona emits energy at many different wave lengths. Loops and arches of matter are often seen extending out from the corona along lines of the Sun's magnetic field. This material flows away from the Sun as the solar wind. Some of the particles reach Earth's atmosphere and interact with atmospheric particles to create the aurora.What is the Sun made of?While approximately 60 different elements make up the Sun, hydrogen accounts for about 92% of the atoms (almost three-fourths of the mass) and helium makes up most of the rest (7.8% of the atoms). This is similar to the composition of our universe; hydrogen is the most abundant element, with some helium and trace amounts of all other heavier elements (such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and silicon). We do not have any direct samples from the Sun but scientists can identify the elements by observing the solar spectrum. The Sun, like other stars, emits light, and in some cases more light in one color than another (and some colors are not emitted at all, because they are absorbed). Gases of different elements have distinct patterns of emission or absorption that can be determined in the laboratory. Once scientists know which pattern matches which element, they can determine the composition of our star, or other stars in the universe, by examining the pattern of the spectrum.Where does the Sun's energy come from?Stars like the Sun generate their power by turning mass into energy through the process of nuclear fusion. Essentially, hydrogen is converted into helium in the Sun's core, and a little bit of energy is produced every time the reaction occurs. Gravitational pressure compresses and heats the core material to over 15 million degrees. In these extreme conditions atoms cannot exist hydrogen atoms split apart into protons and electrons. Four hydrogen protons get fused into a single helium nucleus in a process that releases energy. The resulting helium atom has a smaller mass than the four hydrogen atoms. This mass difference is released as energy. Every second, 600 million tons of hydrogen are converted to radiant energy. The energy is carried by high-energy gamma rays. The gamma rays collide with the electrons in the core, losing energy and becoming photons of visible light. While the Sun emits energy across much of the electromagnetic spectrum, approximately half the solar radiation is in the visible part of the spectrum and much of the rest is infrared radiation. Because of our distance from the Sun, the amount of energy reaching Earth is small, only about one two-billionth compared to the amount emitted by the Sun. The top of Earth's atmosphere receives about 1,365 watts per square meter.How does the Sun influence the Earth?The amount of energy reaching Earth is fairly consistent over time, and is called the solar constant. The Sun, however, is anything but constant! Sunspots move across the photosphere, growing and diminishing in number in an 11-year cycle. Solar flares, possibly caused by sudden changes in the magnetic field, accompany the sunspots and spew gases and particles into space. Clouds of gases occasionally rise and erupt from the chromosphere as coronal mass ejections, corresponding to the 11-year periods of solar maxima. During a mass ejection event, plumes of material pass into space at speeds in excess of 1000 kilometers per second. All this material contributes to the solar wind, a stream of radiation and particles that flows into space from the outer surface of the Sun. Earth's magnetic field deflects and protects us from the solar wind. During periods of extreme solar activity, the radiation and particles interact with our magnetic field to produce the polar auroras. These periods of extreme activity, however, can disrupt communications by damaging the delicate electronics in satellites and interfering with radio waves. Even power grids are not immune; the charged particles alter the magnetic fields around power and phone lines and can induce current surges. While these storms from space are disruptive, they do not directly threaten human health on Earth. This is not true in space; astronauts are not protected by Earth's magnetic field.How are we studying the Sun?The astronomer Galileo initiated our investigations of solar activity with his observations of sunspot movement using the newly invented telescope in the early 1600s (1610-1613). Our investigations continue today but take us beyond the visual realm (http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/edmissns.htm). Space scientists are using all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including the UV, radio, and gamma ranges, to learn more about our star. Their research is aided by satellites such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). Some missions, such as the Genesis sample mission, involve the collection of particles carried by the solar wind. Space scientists will use this information to understand the origin of the Sun and the formation of stars and planets. Other missions, such as the Ulysses solar polar orbiter, orbit the Sun to monitor the solar wind intensity and magnetic field to understand solar processes. Researchers are also monitoring solar activity through the Geotail Mission to understand solar impacts on space exploration, communications, and technology. Moving closer to home, scientists are investigating the interaction of the Sun and Earth systems to learn more about how the Sun influences Earth's weather and climate</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/6a.html<TEXT>IntroductionEnergy is defined simply by scientists as the capacity for doing work. Matter is the material (atoms and molecules) that constructs things on the Earth and in the Universe. Albert Einstein suggested early in this century that energy and matter are related to each other at the atomic level. Einstein theorized that it should be possible to convert matter into energy. From Einstein's theories, scientists were able to harness the energy of matter beginning in the 1940s through nuclear fission. The most spectacular example of this process is a nuclear explosion from an atomic bomb. A more peaceful example of our use of this fact of nature is the production of electricity from controlled fission reactions in nuclear reactors. Einstein also suggested that it should be possible to transform energy into matter.Energy and matter are also associated to each other at much larger scales of nature. Later on in this chapter, we will examine how solar radiation provides the energy to create the matter that makes up organisms. Organisms then use some of this matter to power their metabolism. Types of EnergyEnergy comes in a variety of forms. The simplest definition of the types of energy suggests that two forms exist: kinetic energy and potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy due to motion. A rock falling from a cliff, a bee in flight, wind blowing leaves of trees, and water following over a waterfall are all examples of kinetic energy. Potential energy is the energy stored by an object that can be potentially transformed into another form of energy. Water stored behind a dam, the chemical energy of the food we consume, and the gasoline that we putting in our cars are all examples of potential energy. Conversion of this energy occurs when the energy in food is used by an organism to energize its metabolism, when the water in the dam flows through turbines to produce electricity from motion, and when the gasoline is used in a engine to produce motion from combustion.Some other forms of energy include heat, electricity, sound, energy of chemical reactions, magnetic attraction, energy of atomic reactions, and light. Definitions for a few of these types of energy are as follows:Radiation - is the emission of energy from a material object in the form of electromagnetic waves and photons.Chemical Energy - is the energy produced or consumed in chemical reactions.Atomic Energy - is the energy released from an atomic nucleus because of a change in its subatomic mass.Electrical Energy - is the energy produced from the force between two objects having the physical property of electrical charge.Heat Energy - is a form of energy created by the combined internal motion of atoms in a substance.On Earth, there are fundamentally only three ways in which energy can be transferred from one place to another: conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction involves the adjacent transfer of heat energy from one atom to another through the mass of a gas, liquid, or solid. Condution results in the continuous flow of heat energy along a temperature gradient from areas of higher to lower temperature. Convection involves the transfer of heat energy by way of mass movements of a substance in gas or liquid form in a vertical direction (horizontal transfer is called advection). Convection is often seen as rising masses of gas or liquid called convection currents. It is important to note that energy transfer by way of conduction and convection depends on the presence of matter. These forms of energy transfer do not operate in the vacuum of space. Radiation is the only means of energy transfer that can occur across outer space. The transfer of radiation produced at the Sun's surface through space supplies the Earth with most of its energy.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/6g.html<TEXT>Almost all of the energy that drives the various systems (climate systems, ecosystems, hydrologic systems, etc.) found on the Earth originates from the Sun. Solar energy is created at the core of the Sun when hydrogen atoms are fused into helium by nuclear fusion. For each second of this nuclear process, 700 million tons of hydrogen are converted into 695 million tons of helium. The remaining 5 million tons are turned into electromagnetic energy that radiates from the Sun's surface out into space.The radiative surface of the Sun, or photosphere, has an average temperature of about 5800 Kelvins. Most of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from the Sun's surface lies in the visible band centered at 0.5 m. The total quantity of energy emitted from the Sun's surface is approximately 63,000,000 Watts per square meter (W/m2 or Wm-2).The energy emitted by the Sun passes through space until it is intercepted by planets and other celestial objects. The intensity of solar radiation striking these objects is determined by a physical law known as the Inverse Square Law (see topic 6f). This law merely states that the intensity of the radiation emitted from the Sun varies with the squared distance from the source. As a result of this law, if the intensity of radiation at a given distance is one unit, at twice the distance the intensity will become only one-quarter. At three times the distance, the intensity will become only one-ninth of its original intensity at a distance of one unit, and so on.Given the amount of energy radiated by the Sun and the average Earth-Sun distance of 149.5 million kilometers, the amount of radiation intercepted by the outer limits of the atmosphere can be calculated to be around 1370 W/m2. For general purposes, the energy output of the Sun can be considered constant. This of course is not entirely true. Scientists have shown that the output of the Sun is temporally variable. Some researchers have also suggested that the increase in the average global temperature over the last century may have been solar in origin. This statement, however, is difficult to prove because accurate data on solar output of radiation only goes back to about 1978 (see link).</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/6i.html<TEXT>In the previous topic, we learned that the Earth's seasons are controlled by changes in the duration and intensity of solar radiation or insolation. Both of these factors are in turn governed by the annual change in the position of the Earth's axis relative to the Sun (see Figure 6h-4).Yearly changes in the position of the Earth's axis cause the location of the Sun to wander 47� across our skies. Changes in the location of the Sun have a direct effect on the intensity of solar radiation. The intensity of solar radiation is largely a function of the angle of incidence, the angle at which the Sun's rays strike the Earth's surface. If the Sun is positioned directly overhead or 90� from the horizon, the incoming insolation strikes the surface of the Earth at right angles and is most intense. If the Sun is 45� above the horizon, the incoming insolation strikes the Earth's surface at an angle. This causes the rays to be spread out over a larger surface area reducing the intensity of the radiation. Figure 6i-1 models the effect of changing the angle of incidence from 90 to 45�. As illustrated, the lower Sun angle (45�) causes the radiation to be received over a much larger surface area. This surface area is approximately 40% greater than the area covered by an angle of 90�. The lower angle also reduces the intensity of the incoming rays by 30%.The yearly changes in the position of the Earth's axis relative to the plane of the ecliptic also causes seasonal variations in day length to all locations outside of the equator. Longest days occur during the June solstice for locations north of the equator and on the December solstice for locations in the Southern Hemisphere. The equator experiences equal day and night on every day of the year. Day and night is also of equal length for all Earth locations on the September and March equinoxes. Figure 6i-2 describes the change in the length of day for locations at the equator, 10, 30, 50, 60, and 70 degrees North over a one-year period. The illustration suggests that days are longer than nights in the Northern Hemisphere from the March equinox to the September equinox. Between the September to March equinox days are shorter than nights in the Northern Hemisphere. The opposite is true in the Southern Hemisphere. The graph also shows that the seasonal (winter to summer) variation in day length increases with increasing latitude.Figure 6i-3 below describes the potential insolation available for the equator and several locations in the Northern Hemisphere over a one-year period. The values plotted on this graph take into account the combined effects of angle of incidence and day length duration (see Table 6h-2). Locations at the equator show the least amount of variation in insolation over a one-year period. These slight changes in insolation result only from the annual changes in the altitude of the Sun above the horizon, as the duration of daylight at the equator is always 12 hours. The peaks in insolation intensity correspond to the two equinoxes when the Sun is directly overhead. The two annual minimums of insolation occur on the solstices when the maximum height of the Sun above the horizon reaches an angle of 66.5�.The most extreme variations in insolation received in the Northern Hemisphere occur at 90 degrees North. During the June solstice this location receives more potential incoming solar radiation than any other location graphed. At this time the Sun never sets. In fact, it remains at an altitude of 23.5 degrees above the horizon for the whole day. From September 22 (September equinox) to March 21, (March equinox) no insolation is received at 90 degrees North. During this period the Sun slips below the horizon as the northern axis of the Earth has an orientation that is tilted away from the Sun.The annual insolation curve for locations at 60 degrees North best approximates the seasonal changes in solar radiation intensity perceived at our latitude. Maximum values of insolation are received at the June solstice when day length and angle of incidence are at their maximum (see Table 6h-2 and section 6h). During the June solstice day length is 18 hours and 27 minutes and the angle of the Sun reaches a maximum value of 53.5 degrees above the horizon. Minimum values of insolation are received during the December solstice when day length and angle of incidence are at their minimum (see Table 6h-2 and section 6h). During the December solstice day length is only 5 hours and 33 minutes and the angle of the Sun reaches a lowest value of 6.5 degrees above the horizon.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7h.html<TEXT>The greenhouse effect is a naturally occurring process that aids in heating the Earth's surface and atmosphere. It results from the fact that certain atmospheric gases, such as carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane, are able to change the energy balance of the planet by absorbing longwave radiation emitted from the Earth's surface. Without the greenhouse effect life on this planet would probably not exist as the average temperature of the Earth would be a chilly -18� Celsius, rather than the present 15� Celsius.As energy from the Sun passes through the atmosphere a number of things take place (see Figure 7h-1). A portion of the energy (26% globally) is reflected or scattered back to space by clouds and other atmospheric particles. About 19% of the energy available is absorbed by clouds, gases (like ozone), and particles in the atmosphere. Of the remaining 55% of the solar energy passing through the Earth's atmosphere, 4% is reflected from the surface back to space. On average, about 51% of the Sun's radiation reaches the surface. This energy is then used in a number of processes, including the heating of the ground surface; the melting of ice and snow and the evaporation of water; and plant photosynthesis. The heating of the ground by sunlight causes the Earth's surface to become a radiator of energy in the longwave band (sometimes called infrared radiation). This emission of energy is generally directed to space (see Figure 7h-2). However, only a small portion of this energy actually makes it back to space. The majority of the outgoing infrared radiation is absorbed by the greenhouse gases (see Figure 7h-3 below).Absorption of longwave radiation by the atmosphere causes additional heat energy to be added to the Earth's atmospheric system. The now warmer atmospheric greenhouse gas molecules begin radiating longwave energy in all directions. Over 90% of this emission of longwave energy is directed back to the Earth's surface where it once again is absorbed by the surface. The heating of the ground by the longwave radiation causes the ground surface to once again radiate, repeating the cycle described above, again and again, until no more longwave is available for absorption.The amount of heat energy added to the atmosphere by the greenhouse effect is controlled by the concentration of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere. All of the major greenhouse gases have increased in concentration since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (about 1700 AD). As a result of these higher concentrations, scientists predict that the greenhouse effect will be enhanced and the Earth's climate will become warmer. Predicting the amount of warming is accomplished by computer modeling. Computer models suggest that a doubling of the concentration of the main greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, may raise the average global temperature between 1 and 3� Celsius. However, the numeric equations of computer models do not accurately simulate the effects of a number of possible negative feedbacks. For example, many of the models cannot properly simulate the negative effects that increased cloud cover would have on the radiation balance of a warmer Earth. Increasing the Earth's temperature would cause the oceans to evaporate greater amounts of water, causing the atmosphere to become cloudier. These extra clouds would then reflect a greater proportion of the Sun's energy back to space reducing the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the atmosphere and the Earth's surface. With less solar energy being absorbed at the surface, the effects of an enhanced greenhouse effect may be counteracted.A number of gases are involved in the human caused enhancement of the greenhouse effect (see Table 7h-1 below). These gases include: carbon dioxide (CO2); methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); chlorofluorocarbons (CFxClx); and tropospheric ozone (O3). Of these gases, the single most important gas is carbon dioxide which accounts for about 55% of the change in the intensity of the Earth's greenhouse effect. The contributions of the other gases are 25% for chlorofluorocarbons, 15% for methane, and 5% for nitrous oxide. Ozone's contribution to the enhancement of greenhouse effect is still yet to be quantified. Average concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the year 2005 were about 380 parts per million (see Figure 7a-1). Prior to 1700, levels of carbon dioxide were about 280 parts per million. This increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is primarily due to the activities of humans. Beginning in 1700, societal changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution increased the amount of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere. The major sources of this gas include fossil fuel combustion for industry, transportation, space heating, electricity generation and cooking; and vegetation changes in natural prairie, woodland, and forested ecosystems. Emissions from fossil fuel combustion account for about 65% of the extra carbon dioxide now found in our atmosphere. The remaining 35% is derived from deforestation and the conversion of prairie, woodland, and forested ecosystems primarily into agricultural systems. Natural ecosystems can hold 20 to 100 times more carbon dioxide per unit area than agricultural systems. Artificially created chlorofluorocarbons are the strongest greenhouse gas per molecule. However, low concentrations in the atmosphere reduce their overall importance in the enhancement of the greenhouse effect. Current measurements in the atmosphere indicate that the concentration of these chemicals may soon begin declining because of reduced emissions. Reports of the development of ozone holes over the North and South Poles and a general decline in global stratospheric ozone levels over the last two decades has caused many nations to cutback on their production and use of these chemicals. In 1987, the signing of the Montreal Protocol agreement by forty-six nations established an immediate timetable for the global reduction of chlorofluorocarbons production and use. Since 1750, methane concentrations in the atmosphere have increased by more than 150%. The primary sources for the additional methane added to the atmosphere (in order of importance) are rice cultivation, domestic grazing animals, termites, landfills, coal mining, and oil and gas extraction. Anaerobic conditions associated with rice paddy flooding results in the formation of methane gas. However, an accurate estimate of how much methane is being produced from rice paddies has been difficult to obtain. More than 60% of all rice paddies are found in India and China where scientific data concerning emission rates are unavailable. Nevertheless, scientists believe that the contribution of rice paddies is large because this form of crop production has more than doubled since 1950. Grazing animals release methane to the environment as a result of herbaceous digestion. Some researchers believe the addition of methane from this source has more than quadrupled over the last century. Termites also release methane through similar processes. Land-use change in the tropics, due to deforestation, ranching, and farming, may be causing termite numbers to expand. If this assumption is correct, the contribution from these insects may be important. Methane is also released from landfills, coal mines, and gas and oil drilling. Landfills produce methane as organic wastes decompose over time. Coal, oil, and natural gas deposits release methane to the atmosphere when these deposits are excavated or drilled. The average concentration of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere is now increasing at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3% per year. Sources for this increase include land-use conversion; fossil fuel combustion; biomass burning; and soil fertilization. Most of the nitrous oxide added to the atmosphere each year comes from deforestation and the conversion of forest, savanna and grassland ecosystems into agricultural fields and rangeland. Both of these processes reduce the amount of nitrogen stored in living vegetation and soil through the decomposition of organic matter. Nitrous oxide is also released into the atmosphere when fossil fuels and biomass are burned. However, the combined contribution of these sources to the increase of this gas in the atmosphere is thought to be minor. The use of nitrate and ammonium fertilizers to enhance plant growth is another source of nitrous oxide. Accurate measurements of how much nitrous oxide is being released from fertilization have been difficult to obtain. Estimates suggest that the contribution from this source may represent from 50% to 0.2% of nitrous oxide added to the atmosphere annually. ??Ozone's role in the enhancement of the greenhouse effect has been difficult to determine scientifically. Accurate measurements of past long-term (more than 25 years in the past) levels of this gas in the atmosphere are currently unavailable. Concentrations of ozone gas are found in two different regions of the Earth's atmosphere. The majority of the ozone (about 97%) found in the atmosphere is localized in the stratosphere at an altitude of 15 to 55 kilometers above the Earth's surface. In recent years, the concentration of the stratospheric ozone has been decreasing because of the buildup of chlorofluorocarbons in the atmosphere (see Lecture 7e). Since the late 1970s, scientists have discovered that total column ozone amounts over Antarctica in the springtime have decreased by as much as 70%. Satellite measurements have indicated that the zone from 65� North to 65� South latitude has had a 3% decrease in stratospheric ozone since 1978. Ozone is also highly concentrated at the Earth's surface. Most of this ozone is created as an artificial by product of photochemical smog.In summary, the greenhouse effect causes the atmosphere to trap more heat energy at the Earth's surface and within the atmosphere by absorbing and re-emitting longwave energy. Of the longwave energy emitted back to space, 90% is intercepted and absorbed by greenhouse gases. Without the greenhouse effect the Earth's average global temperature would be -18� Celsius, rather than the present 15� Celsius. In the last few centuries, the activities of humans have directly or indirectly caused the concentration of the major greenhouse gases to increase. Scientists predict that this increase may enhance the greenhouse effect making the planet warmer. Some experts estimate that the Earth's average global temperature has already increased by 0.3 to 0.6� Celsius, since the beginning of this century, because of this enhancement. Predictions of future climates indicate that by the middle of the next century the Earth's global temperature may be 1 to 3� Celsius higher than today.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7g.html<TEXT>The following image describes the annual pattern of solar radiation absorption at the Earth's surface for the year 1987.The combined effect of Earth-Sun relationships (angle of incidence and day length variations) and the modification of the solar beam as it passes through the atmosphere produces specific global patterns of annual insolation receipt as seen on Figure 7g-1 above (and see the NASA WWW links below). After examining these patterns, the following trends can be identified:Highest values of insolation received occur in tropical latitudes. Within this zone there are localized maximums over the tropical oceans and deserts where the atmosphere has virtually no cloud development for most of the year. Insolation quantities at the equator over land during the solstices are approximately the same as values found in the middle latitudes during their summer (see NASA WWW links below).Outside the tropics, annual receipts of solar radiation generally decrease with increasing latitude. Minimum values occur at the poles. This pattern is primarily the result of Earth-Sun geometric relationships and its effect on the duration and intensity of solar radiation received.In middle and high latitudes, insolation values over the ocean, as compared to those at the same latitude over the land, are generally higher (see NASA images). Greater cloudiness over land surfaces accounts for this variation.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7k.html<TEXT>Temperature and HeatTemperature and heat are not the same phenomenon. Temperature is a measure of the intensity or degree of hotness in a body. Technically, it is determined by getting the average speed of a body's molecules. Heat is a measure of the quantity of heat energy present in a body. The spatial distribution of temperature in a body determines heat flow. Heat always flows from warmer to colder areas.The heat held in a object depends not only on its temperature but also its mass. For example, let us compare the heating of two different masses of water (Table 7k-1). In this example, one mass has a weight of 5 grams, while the other is 25 grams. If the temperature of both masses is raised from 20 to 25� Celsius, the larger mass of water will require five times more heat energy for this increase in temperature. This larger mass would also contain contain 5 times more stored heat energy. Temperature ScalesA number of measurement scales have been invented to measure temperature. Table 7k-2 describes important temperatures for the three dominant scales in use today.The most commonly used scale for measuring temperature is the Celsius system. The Celsius scale was developed in 1742 by the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius. In this system, the melting point of ice was given a value of 0, the boiling point of water is 100, and absolute zero is -273. The Fahrenheit system is a temperature scale that is used exclusively in the United States. This system was created by German physicist Gabriel Fahrenheit in 1714. In this scale, the melting point of ice has a value of 32, water boils at 212, and absolute zero has a temperature of -460. The Kelvin scale was proposed by British physicist Lord Kelvin in 1848. This system is often used by scientists because its temperature readings begin at absolute zero and due to the fact that this scale is proportional to the amount of heat energy found in an object. The Kelvin scale assigns a value of 273 for the melting temperature of ice, while the boiling point of water occurs at 373.Measurement of Air TemperatureA thermometer is a device that is used to measure temperature. Thermometers consist of a sealed hollow glass tube filled with some type of liquid. Thermometers measure temperature by the change in the volume of the liquid as it responds to the addition or loss of heat energy from the environment immediately outside its surface. When heat is added, the liquid inside the thermometer expands. Cooling cause the liquid to contract. Meteorological thermometers are often filled with either alcohol or mercury. Alcohol thermometers are favored in very cold environments because of this liquid's low freezing point (-112� Celsius).By international agreement, the nations of the world have decided to measure temperature in a similar fashion. This standardization is important for the accurate generation of weather maps and forecasts, both of which depend on having data determined in a uniform way. Weather stations worldwide try to determine minimum and maximum temperatures for each and every day. By averaging these two values, daily mean temperatures are also calculated. Many stations also take temperature readings on the hour. Temperature measurements are determined by thermometers designed and approved by the World Meteorological Organization (see http://www.wmo.ch). These instruments are housed in specially designed instrument shelters that allow for the standardization of measurements taken anywhere on the Earth (Figure 7k-1 and Figure 7k-2).</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7m.html<TEXT>If the Earth was a homogeneous body without the present land/ocean distribution, its temperature distribution would be strictly latitudinalHowever, the Earth is more complex than this being composed of a mosaic of land and water. This mosaic causes latitudinal zonation of temperature to be disrupted spatially.The following two factors are important in influencing the distribution of temperature on the Earth's surface:The latitude of the location determines how much solar radiation is received. Latitude influences the angle of incidence and duration of daylength.Surface properties - surfaces with high albedo absorb less incident radiation. In general, land absorbs less insolation that water because of its lighter color. Also, even if two surfaces have the same albedo, a surface's specific heat determines the amount of heat energy required for a specific rise in temperature per unit mass. The specific heat of water is some five times greater than that of rock and the land surface. As a result, water requires the input of large amounts of energy to cause a rise in its temperature.Mainly because of specific heat, land surfaces behave quite differently from water surfaces. In general, the surface of any extensive deep body of water heats more slowly and cools more slowly than the surface of a large land body. Other factors influencing the way land and water surfaces heat and cool include:Solar radiation warms an extensive layer in water, on land just the immediate surface is heated.Water is easily mixed by the process of convection.Evaporation of water removes energy from water's surface.The following images illustrate the Earth's temperature distribution patterns for an average January and July based on 39 years of data. Note that the spatial variations of temperature on these figures is mostly latitudinal. However, the horizontal banding of isotherms is somewhat upset by the fact that water heats up more slowly in the summer and cools down more slowly in the winter when compared to land surfaces. During January, much of the terrestrial areas of the Northern Hemisphere are below freezing. Some notable Northern Hemisphere cold-spots include the area around Baffin Island Canada, Greenland, Siberia, and the Plateau of Tibet. Temperatures over oceans tend to be hotter because of the water's ability to hold heat energy.In the Southern Hemisphere, temperatures over the major landmasses are generally greater than 20� Celsius with localized hot-spots in west-central Australia, the Kalahari Desert in Africa, and the plains of Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina. Subtropical oceans are often warmer than landmass areas near the equator. At this latitude, land areas receive less incoming solar radiation because of the daily convective development of cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds. In the mid-latitudes, oceans are often cooler than landmass areas at similar latitudes. Terrestrial areas are warmer because of the rapid heating of land surfaces under frequently clear skies. Antarctica remains cold and below zero degrees Celsius due to the presence of permanent glacial ice which reflects much of the solar radiation received back to space.In July, the Northern Hemisphere is experiencing its summer season because the North Pole is now tilted towards the Sun. Some conspicuous hot-spots include the south-central United States, Arizona and northwest Mexico, northern Africa, the Middle East, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Temperatures over oceans tend to be relatively cooler because of the land's ability to heat quickly. Two terrestrial areas of cooler temperatures include Greenland and the Plateau of Tibet. In these regions, most of the incoming solar radiation is sent back to space because of the presence of reflective ice and snow.In the Southern Hemisphere, temperatures over the major landmasses are generally cooler than ocean surfaces at the same latitude. Antarctica is bitterly cold because it is experiencing total darkness. Note that Antarctica is much colder than the Arctic was during its winter season. The Arctic consists mainly of ocean. During the summer, this surface is able to absorb considerable quantities of sunlight which is then converted into heat energy. The heat stored in the ocean is carried over into the winter season. Antarctica has a surface composed primarily of snow and ice. This surface absorbs only a small amount of the solar radiation during the summer. So it never really heats up. As a result, the amount of heat energy stored into the winter season is minimal.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7n.html<TEXT>Wind can be defined simply as air in motion. This motion can be in any direction, but in most cases the horizontal component of wind flow greatly exceeds the flow that occurs vertically. The speed of wind varies from absolute calm to speeds as high as 380 kilometers per hour (Mt. Washington, New Hampshire, April 12, 1934). In 1894, strong winds in Nebraska pushed six fully loaded coal cars over 160 kilometers in just over three hours. Over short periods of time surface winds can be quite variable.Wind develops as a result of spatial differences in atmospheric pressure. Generally, these differences occur because of uneven absorption of solar radiation at the Earth's surface (Figure 7n-1). Wind speed tends to be at its greatest during the daytime when the greatest spatial extremes in atmospheric temperature and pressure exist.Wind is often described by two characteristics: wind speed and wind direction. Wind speed is the velocity attained by a mass of air traveling horizontally through the atmosphere. Wind speed is often measured with an anemometer in kilometers per hour (kmph), miles per hour (mph), knots, or meters per second (mps) (Figure 7n-2). Wind direction is measured as the direction from where a wind comes from. For example, a southerly wind comes from the south and blows to the north. Direction is measured by an instrument called a wind vane (Figure 7n-2). Both of these instruments are positioned in the atmospheric environment at a standard distance of 10 meters above the ground surface.Wind speed can also be measured without the aid of instruments using the Beaufort wind scale (Table 7n-1). This descriptive scale was originally developed by Admiral Beaufort of the British Navy in the first decade of the 17th century. The purpose for this system was to allow mariners to determine wind speed from simple observations. The Beaufort system has undergone several modifications to standardize its measurement scale and to allow for its use on land. Users of this scale look for specific effects of the wind on the environment to determine speed. Winds are named according to the compass direction of their source. Thus, a wind from the north blowing toward the south is called a northerly wind. Figure 7n-3 describes the sixteen principal bearings of wind direction. Most meterological observations report wind direction using one of these sixteen bearings.Horizontally, at the Earth's surface wind always blows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure (vertically, winds move from areas of low pressure to areas of high pressure), usually at speeds determined by the rate of air pressure change between pressure centers. This situation is comparable to someone skiing down a hill. The skier will of course move from the top of the hill to the bottom of the hill, with the speed of their descent controlled by the gradient or steepness of the slope. Likewise, wind speed is a function of the steepness or gradient of atmospheric air pressure found between high and low pressure systems. When expressed scientifically, pressure change over a unit distance is called pressure gradient force, and the greater this force the faster the winds will blow.On weather maps, pressure is indicated by drawing isolines of pressure, called isobars, at regular 4 millibar intervals (e.g., 996 mb, 1000 mb, 1004 mb, etc.). If the isobars are closely spaced, we can expect the pressure gradient force to be great, and wind speed to be high (see Figure 7n-4). In areas where the isobars are spaced widely apart, the pressure gradient is low and light winds normally exist. High speed winds develop in areas where isobars are closer.Driving ForcesTo better understand wind we must recognize that it is the result of a limited number of accelerating and decelerating forces, and that the action of these forces is controlled by specific fundamental natural laws. Sir Isaac Newton formulated these laws as several laws of motion. The first law suggests that an object that is stationary will remain stationary, and an object in motion will stay in motion as long as no opposing force is put on the object. As a result of this law, a puck sent in flight from a blade of a hockey stick will remain in motion until friction slows it down or the goalie makes a save. This law also suggests that once in motion an object's path should be straight.Newton's second law of motion suggests that the force put on an object equals its mass multiplied by the acceleration produced. The term force in this law refers to the total or net effect of all the forces acting on an object. Mathematically, this law is written as:Force = Mass x AccelerationorAcceleration = Force/MassFrom this natural law of motion we can see that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force pushing or pulling that body and inversely proportional to the mass of the body. Thus, the greater the force created by the movement of a hockey player's stick the faster the puck will travel. This law also suggests that if the player used a larger (more massive) puck more force would have to be applied to it to get it to travel as fast as a puck with less mass.In the previous lecture we briefly examined one of the forces, pressure gradient force, acting on wind. Let us return to this force and examine it in greater detail and in relation to Newton's laws of motion. We will also examine the effects of three other forces that act on air in motion.Pressure gradient force is the primary force influencing the formation of wind from local to global scales. This force is determined by the spatial pattern of atmospheric pressure at any given moment in time. Figure 7n-5 illustrates two different pressure gradient scenarios and their relative effect on wind speed.Figure 7n-5: Effect of pressure gradient on wind speed.The two diagrams display the relative relationship between pressure gradient and wind speed. This relationship is linear and positive. As a result, quadrupling the pressure gradient increases wind speed by a factor of four. This is what we would expect according to Newton's second law of motion, assuming the mass of the wind is unchanged.We can also describe pressure gradient acceleration mathematically with the following equation:where: From this equation we can determine wind acceleration between two points in meters per second squared by knowing three variables: the density of the moving air; the change in pressure between the points of interest in newtons; and the distance between the two points in meters. For example, to determine the wind speed between two points for moving air with a density of 1.29 kilograms per cubic meter, a pressure difference of 400 Newtons/m2, and a distance of 300,000 meters, the following calculations would be performed:  From the calculated value of acceleration we can determine wind speed, V, from the formula:  Where V0 is the initial velocity of the wind and t is the time during which F is applied. The rotation of the Earth creates another force, termed Coriolis force, which acts upon wind and other objects in motion in very predictable ways. According to Newton's first law of motion, air will remain moving in a straight line unless it is influenced by an unbalancing force. The consequence of Coriolis force opposing pressure gradient acceleration is that the moving air changes direction. Instead of wind blowing directly from high to low pressure, the rotation of the Earth causes wind to be deflected off course. In the Northern Hemisphere, wind is deflected to the right of its path, while in the Southern Hemisphere it is deflected to the left. The magnitude of the Coriolis force varies with the velocity and the latitude of the object (see Figure 7n-6). Coriolis force is absent at the equator, and its strength increases as one approaches either pole. Furthermore, an increase in wind speed also results in a stronger Coriolis force, and thus in greater deflection of the wind. Coriolis force only acts on air when it has been sent into motion by pressure gradient force. Finally, Coriolis force only influences wind direction and never wind speed.Centripetal acceleration is the third force that can act on moving air. It acts only on air that is flowing around centers of circulation. Centripetal acceleration is also another force that can influence the direction of wind. Centripetal acceleration creates a force directed at right angles to the flow of the wind and inwards towards the centers of rotation (e.g., low and high pressure centers). This force produces a circular pattern of flow around centers of high and low pressure. Centripetal acceleration is much more important for circulations smaller than the mid-latitude cyclone.The last force that can influence moving air is frictional deceleration. Friction can exert an influence on wind only after the air is in motion. Frictional drag acts in a direction opposite to the path of motion causing the moving air to decelerate (see Newton's first and second laws of motion). Frictional effects are limited to the lower one kilometer above the Earth's surface. Geostrophic WindAir under the influence of both the pressure gradient force and Coriolis force tends to move parallel to isobars in conditions where friction is low (1000 meters above the surface of the Earth) and isobars are straight. Winds of this type are usually called geostrophic winds. Geostrophic winds come about because pressure gradient force and Coriolis force come into balance after the air begins to move (Figure 7n-7). Figure 7n-7 models air flow in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, Coriolis acceleration acts on moving air by deflecting it to the left instead of the right.Finally, Buy Ballot's Law states that when you stand with your back to a geostrophic wind in the Northern Hemisphere the center of low pressure will be to your left and the high pressure to your right. The opposite is true for the Southern Hemisphere. Gradient WindWind above the Earth's surface does not always travel in straight lines. In many cases winds flow around the curved isobars of a high (anticyclone) or low (cyclone) pressure center. A wind that blows around curved isobars above the level of friction is called a gradient wind. Gradient winds are slightly more complex than geostrophic winds because they include the action of yet another physical force. This force is known as centripetal force and it is always directed toward the center of rotation. The following figure describes the forces that produce gradient winds around high and low pressure centers (Figure 7n-8). Around a low, the gradient wind consists of the pressure gradient force and centripetal force acting toward the center of rotation, while Coriolis force acts away from the center of the low. In a high pressure center, the Coriolis and centripetal forces are directed toward the center of the high, while the pressure gradient force is directed outward. Friction Layer WindSurface winds on a weather map do not blow exactly parallel to the isobars as in geostrophic and gradient winds. Instead, surface winds tend to cross the isobars at an angle varying from 10 to 45�. Close to the Earth's surface, friction reduces the wind speed, which in turn reduces the Coriolis force. As a result, the reduced Coriolis force no longer balances the pressure gradient force, and the wind blows across the isobars toward or away from the pressure center. The pressure gradient force is now balanced by the sum of the frictional force and the Coriolis force. Thus, we find surface winds blowing counterclockwise and inward into a surface low, and clockwise and out of a surface high in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Southern Hemisphere, the Coriolis force acts to the left rather than the right. This causes the winds of the Southern Hemisphere to blow clockwise and inward around surface lows, and counterclockwise and outward around surface highs (see Figure 7n-9 below).</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/spacesciences/observingsky/motion1.htm<TEXT>Observing the Sky: Motion of the Earth - RotationFrom Earth, we see the Sun rise, move across the sky, and set. The stars do the same each night. All of this apparent motion makes it easy to forget that the Sun and stars aren't really moving at all. They only seem to move because the Earth is constantly rotating, or spinning, carrying us in and out of view of the Sun and stars.The view from Earth is a bit like the view from a moving car. Looking out a side window you see trees and houses passing by. Now imagine that car is going in a circle. You pass the same scenery over and over again. We are all passengers on the surface of the rotating Earth and it carries us past the Sun, day after day.The Earth rotates around the axis, an imaginary line through the center of the planet. The axis connects the North and South Poles like an axle connects the wheels on a car. As the Earth spins on its axis, we are carried in and out of the sunlight that is always shining on half the planet. When one side of the planet has day, the opposite side has night. The Earth's axis does not point straight up and down, but is tilted 23.5'. This means that different places pass through different amounts of sunlight and darkness each day.Luckily for us, the tilted Earth doesn't just spin in the same place, it also revolves around the Sun on a path that's called an orbit. It takes the Earth 365 days to complete the trip. The orbit is not quite a perfect circle (it's an ellipse) and seen from the side it is flat. Astronomers refer to this flat orbit as the plane of the ecliptic, which has nothing to do with an airplane, because plane also means a flat surface. The Earth's tilt stays constant even as the planet revolves, keeping the poles always pointing in the same directions. So as the Earth orbits, each pole spends some time leaning toward the Sun and some time leaning away. This keeps the seasons changing and changes your position relative to the Sun throughout the year.Solar vs. Sidereal DaysThere are actually two ways to measure the length of a day. A solar day is equal to one complete rotation of the Earth relative to the Sun. For example, sunrise to sunrise, or noon to noon. This rotation takes 24 hours. A sidereal day is the time it takes the Earth to rotate once relative to the stars. This rotation takes 23 hours and 56 minutes. A solar day is longer because the Earth moves along its orbit, making the Sun appear a little farther to the East each day.If you traveled to different parts of the world you would notice that the lengths of days and nights can be very different, even at the same time of year. For example, if you left Washington, DC, on a long, hot summer's day and headed down to Buenos Aires, Argentina, you would find yourself on a short, cold winter's day! On that same day, if you went to the North Pole you would never see the Sun set. If you went to the South Pole, you would never see the Sun rise, even if you waited a full 24 hours!If you live near the equator, you don't experience winter, spring, summer, and fall. But farther to the north and south, you notice a change in the seasons. The seasons can be different lengths and temperatures depending on where you are. In some places, winter is very cold with lots of snow and ice. In other places, winter is not much cooler than summer and it is not cold enough for snow. In the regions midway between the equator and the poles, the seasons do change and each lasts about 3 months.The changing seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth and its orbit around the Sun. When one hemisphere leans more toward the Sun, it receives more direct sunlight while the other hemisphere receives more indirect sunlight. Direct sunlight brings more of the Sun's energy to a given area so people can spend more time outside without bundling up. If the Earth did not orbit the Sun, the amount of direct or indirect light each area receives would never change and we would all be stuck in the same seasons forever.The Earth's rotation and tilt not only give us the seasons, they also affect how the Sun and stars seem to move throughout the year.We say the Sun rises in the East and sets in the West, yet this is only true on two days each year. During summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the Sun rises north of East and sets north of West. In winter, the Sun rises south of East and sets south of West. Only on the Spring and Fall Equinoxes does the Sun rise due (exactly) East and set due West.When the Sun rises north of East, it passes higher through our sky on its way to the western horizon. Summer days are long because the Sun must travel through more sky before setting. The farther south the Sun rises, the lower it stays in our sky and the shorter the days. On the longest day of the year, the Summer Solstice, the Sun reaches its highest altitude in our sky at midday. At midday the Sun is due South and it crosses the meridian, an imaginary line that divides your sky into eastern and western halves. Each day after the Summer Solstice, the Sun's altitude at midday will be slightly lower until it reaches its lowest midday altitude on the Winter Solstice, the shortest day of the year.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.polaris.iastate.edu/NorthStar/Unit3/unit3_sub1.htm<TEXT>Earth's RotationEarth's Rotation and the Apparent Daily Motion of the SkyThe earth rotates about an imaginary line that passes through the North and South Poles of the planet.  This line is called the axis of rotation.  Earth rotates about this axis once each day (approximately 24 hours).  Although you most likely already knew that fact, there is a slight complication most people are not aware of.More specifically, our rotation period (the time elapsed for one rotation) with respect to the stars  is called a sidereal day.  A sidereal day is 24 sidereal hours, or 23 hours and 56 minutes on a normal clock.  Our clock time is based on the earth's rotation with respect to the sun from solar noon to solar noon.  This is a solar day, and it is divided into 24 hours.  Because Earth travels about 1 / 365 of the way around the sun during one day, there is a small difference between solar time and sidereal time.The earth takes about 1/365 of a day or about 4 minutes more to get into the same position with respect to the sun after it reaches the same position with respect to the stars. We use sun-based time because it is more important to most of us whether the Sun is up than whether a given star is up. Those who care which star is up (like astronomers) may also use sidereal time.1) The sidereal day is shorter than the solar day because the earth rotates and revolves in the same sense - counterclockwise in the diagram above. Venus rotates in the opposite direction to its revolution - is its sidereal day longer or shorter than its solar day?Note: Astronomers and other scientists sometimes use ordinary words but with different or more limited meaning attached.  The words "rotate" and "revolve" are examples of this:  To an astronomer, "rotate" = spin around an axis that runs through you, and "revolve" = orbit about another object.  One time around = one revolution.  In the 1500's Copernicus published a radical theory of the solar system in which he proposed that the planets revolve about the sun.  His book "on the revolutions of the planets" changed how we view our universe.  From its title we get the word "revolution" meaning "action giving rise to radical change in society".So which way does the world turn?  One way to visualize how the earth turns is to hold out your right fist with your thumb extended and pointing straight up (the traditional hitchhiker fist).   If you visualize that your thumb points north, then your fingers are curling in the direction of Earth's rotation.  Because of this easy set up, we say that the earth rotates in a "right-handed" manner (because you are using your right hand as a model).You can take this model a step further by visualizing that the base of your thumb is where Europe and  Africa are located (Europe is above Africa of course when North is up).  The Atlantic Ocean would be on your fingers and the flat part of your fist by your knuckles are the Americas.  The back of your hand is the Pacific Ocean, which leaves Asia to rest where your wrist is.  If you keep this simple model in mind, you will always have an Earth-globe to check directions by.  This is not so different from counting using your fingers.For an observer at a fixed position on Earth, the rotation of the earth makes it appear as if the sky is revolving around the earth.  In other words, if you are standing for long enough in a field at night, it looks like the sky is moving, not you.  This motion is called "apparent diurnal motion."  "Diurnal" means having to do with a day, in the sense of a 24-hour period.Please note that the word "day" has two popular meanings, which can lead to confusion in astronomical contexts.  Day can mean when it is light out, as in "day or night."  Or, it can indicate a 24-hour period.  Here we only use the second meaning.  You might want to be careful to do the same.In the diagram to the right we show the earth as seen from space with Ames, Iowa, the home of Iowa State, at the top.  This means that a person in Ames would be standing with his or her head towards the top of the diagram.  This picture may seem confusing at first because we like to think of north as always being up, but remember that up and down are arbitrary designations in space. People in Australia, in the Southern Hemisphere of our planet, certainly do not consider themselves as being upside down.The earth rotates around the North - South (N-S) line, so that if we watched it rotate, the parts at the bottom left -- Indonesia, Australia -- would move up and to the right being parallel to the dashed line (the equator).</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.polaris.iastate.edu/NorthStar/Unit4/unit4_sub1.htm<TEXT>Apparent Motions of the SunDuring the year the earth moves around the sun.  As a result, the sun appears to move around the sky once with respect to the stars as seen from Earth.Earth takes about 365 and a quarter days to travel once around the sun.  Since the earth moves around the sun and we are resident on the earth, it means that the sun appears to shift in the sky about 1 degree per day.  This number is calculated by taking the total degrees in a circle (360 deg, since the earth moves 360 degrees around the sun) and dividing that amount by the total number of days in a year (365.2422).  The result is 360 deg / 365.2422 days to equal about 1 degree per day.The plane of the earth's orbit is called the ecliptic.  Since the earth orbits the sun, the sun is also on the ecliptic.  As a result, the sun appears to us to move around the sky on the ecliptic.Please note that the ecliptic is not the same thing as the earth's extended equator, the celestial equator.  The earth's axis (and hence also the celestial equator) is actually tilted by 23.5 degrees with respect to the plane of the earth's orbit, or the ecliptic. appears to be inclined, or tilted, 23.5 degrees from the plane of the earth's equator, as demonstrated above.  This orientation means that the sun appears to transit the sky north of the eelestial equator during part of the year and south of the eelestial equator the other part of the year.  The interactive graphic below illustrates this point.In the plot above, declination is on the Y axis (or vertical axis) and right ascension (measured in hours) is across the top.  You can take this sky plot and wrap it around a sphere, with the two points at the edges labeled "vernal equinox"just touching.   Both the celestial equator (the straight line with dec = 0 deg) and the Ecliptic (the sun's apparent path) would be circles on the surface of the Celestial Sphere.  Click on the silver play button above to watch the successive steps.  The interactive graphic will repeat itself after you pass through all the season.The maximum declination that the sun achieves is +23.5 degrees.  This number naturally corresponds to the tilt of the Earth's axis.  The sun reaches this declination at the summer solstice around June 21.  This day is also called "midsummer" or "the first day of summer".  The sun reaches a declination of -23.5 degrees at the winter solstice, about Dec. 21.So, around December 21, the sun has a declination of 23.5 degrees.  As the months pass, the sun gradually moves higher in sky (northward if you are in the northern hemisphere) as it gains declination (greater than 23.5 degrees).  Around March 21, the Sun crosses the celestial equator.  This moment and the date are both called the vernal equinox.  The day is also called "the first day of spring."  To make things even a little more confusing, the position in the sky where the sun passes the celestial equator heading north is also called the vernal equinox.  Don't let this confuse you, it is no worse than knowing three people who are all named "Tom."Remember! We are talking about the gradual shift in the sky over the course of a year, not the sun's daily transit from east to west.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.polaris.iastate.edu/NorthStar/Unit5/unit5_sub1.htm<TEXT>Latitude and ClimateOne of the most important factors determining your climate is your latitude.  Between 23.5S and 23.5N latitude we have the tropics - where high temperatures are the norm, and the sun can beat down from directly overhead once or twice each year.  From 23.5N to 66.5N and between 23.5S and 66.5S are the temperate zones, where there are clear spring/summer/fall/winter seasons.  From 66.5N to the North Pole we have the Arctic, and from 66.5S to the South Pole, the Antarctic.  In these arctic zones the sun is above the horizon at midnight for part or all of the summer and never rises at all during some day(s) in the winter.  At the pole, daily motion is parallel to the horizon.With the meridian diagram, we can find out the altitude of the sun at noon at any season as observed from any place on Earth.  This information can be very helpful in planning a garden or a house so that the sun will shine on the areas we want it to.  Knowing the sun's altitude at noon in the summer is also useful in figuring out how to shade your windows against the noon summer sun, while allowing the winter sun to shine in and keep you warm in the interior. The following meridian diagram is sketched for Ames, Iowa latitude of 42 degrees N.Just as in Question 5-1-1 above, at the winter solstice, the angle between the arrow pointing to the sun and the arrow pointing to the celestial equator in the interactive graphic above is equal to the tilt of Earth's axis, 23.5 degrees.  The tilt of the Earth's axis results in an apparent annual motion of the sun from -23.5 deg in December to +23.5 deg in June, on the date of the summer solstice.Thus, the altitude of the sun at noon in Ames at the winter solstice is 48 degrees minus 23.5 degrees = 24.5 degrees.  This is true because the celestial equator is at 90 minus the local latitude = 90 - 42 = 48 deg altitude, as seen from Ames.  At the winter solstice, the sun is 23.5 degrees S. of the CE, so the sun is lower in the sky by 23.5 degrees, which means it reaches an altitude of 24.5 degrees.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.polaris.iastate.edu/NorthStar/Unit5/unit5_sub2.htm<TEXT>Reason for the SeasonsWhy is the summer warmer than the winter?There are three reasons why summer is warmer than winter, and all three have to do with the greater altitude of the sun in the sky during the day in the summer.The fourth effect many people expect will be important is the distance from the earth to the sun.  But that effect turns out not to matter much at all.  Click here for details.Reason 1: Area AffectThe altitude of the sun in the Ames, Iowa sky throughout the day at the solstices and the equinoxes are displayed in a chart at the end of this section for reference.  From that graph you can verify that in the summer, not only is the sun up longer than 12 hours, but it is also higher in the sky at every time of the day.Longer days mean the earth is soaking up the suns energy for more hours.  When the sun is higher in the sky, the energy is concentrated on a smaller area.  This is called the "Area Affect."  In other words, when the sun is lower in the sky, the energy is spread out over a larger area as demonstrated in the illustration below."Longer days allow more hours to soak up energy from the sunshine.  When the sun is higher in the sky, the amount of its light energy gets spread out over a smaller area than when the sun is low in the sky.  This is the area effect."Reason 2: Air Mass EffectIn addition to being spread out over a larger area when the sun is lower in the sky, the sunlight must also pass through a greater amount of the earth's atmosphere.  The atmosphere appears to the sunlight to be "thicker."  If we approximate a local area as a flat plane (ignoring the curvature of the earth), we can use the following diagram to illustrate the point.  This is called the Plane Parallel approximation.Click "Continue" at the bottom of the graphic when you are ready to go to the next step.When the sun is lower in the sky, its light must pass through more of the atmosphere before reaching us and therefore the light is more likely to bounce into space or be scattered to the ground somewhere else.  This is the "air mass effect."Using facts that we already know, we can tell which of these effects - length of day, area effect, or air mass effect -  is most important to us.  This evaluation can be done by calculations of how much heat reaches the ground depending on the altitude of the sun, but it gets rather complicated.Reason 3: Length of Day (Based on Latitude)At the equator in the summer, the sun is up 12 hours every day.  At the latitude of Minneapolis, 45N, the longest day is more than 12 hours.  Further north, at 66.5N, the longest day has 24 hours with the sun above the horizon.  This is also a big effect, and in fact calculations show it is slightly more important than the area effect.  Why, then, is Winnipeg cooler than Des Moines in July?  Go to the next sub-unit and find out!</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.polaris.iastate.edu/NorthStar/Unit5/unit5_sub3.htm<TEXT>The Altitude of the Sun isn't the Whole StoryWhy do we call the vernal equinox the first day of spring?  We also call the summer solstice, which is the longest day of the year, the first day of summer.  And, the shortest day of the year, the winter solstice, is called the first day of winter.  It seems like it would make more sense to call these days mid-spring, mid-summer, and mid-winter.  So why is that not the case?In places where the difference between the length of day and night is greater between summer and winter (such as very far north Alaska, Norway, etc), the solstices are called midsummer and midwinter.  But where the temperature variation is more noticeable than the variation in the length of the day, like in Iowa or the lower United States, we use the terms "the first day of summer," etc.It actually does make some sense.  The coldest day of the year is not generally close to the shortest day, however, but comes a couple of weeks to a month later. Our coldest months are December, January, and February, even though the winter solstice is in December.  So there is a delay, or lag between the shortest day (the day with the least amount of sunlight during the year) and the coldest time of the year.If we get more direct sunlight (and more sunlight in general due to the longer days) at the summer solstice than on any other day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, why isn't June 21 (the summer solstice) the hottest day of the year?On this plot above, the number 1 on the X-axis (the bottom axis) equals "January."  The number 2 = February, and so on.  Notice the chart goes to 24, meaning that it plots temperature curves for 2 full years.  Since the plot has the mean temperature for all of January (the average temperature), we can say the plot point at 1 or 13 best represents what the temperature might be on January 15.Using the numbering scale on the X-axis as we are, the longest day of the year, June 21, shows up on the graph in the first year as a little over 6.  To be exact it shows up as 6.2.  In the second year, June 21 is the number 18.2.  The peak temperature occurs at number 7 in the plot for the first year, yet the longest day in the year is at 6.2.  This difference indicates that there is a seasonal delay of 0.8 months.The reason for this delay between maximum heating and maximum heat (temperature) is that it takes time to warm up the ground.  Similarly, in the winter, heat stored in the ground gradually leaks out, giving us our coldest weather in January and not in December, when the shortest day occurs.While latitude is the main factor in determining your climate as we saw in Unit 4.1, there are a couple of other important factors that affect your local climate as well.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/revolution-rotation<TEXT>Revolution and RotationAlthough often confused, there is a distinct and important difference in the concepts of revolution and rotation. Earth rotates on its axis as it revolves around the Sun.Earth rotates about its axis at approximately 15 angular degrees per hour. Rotation dictates the length of the diurnal cycle (i.e, the day/night cycle), creates "time zones" with differing local noons, and also causes the apparent movement of the Moon, stars, and planets across the "celestial sphere". The rotation of Earth is eastward (from west to east) making the apparent rotation of the celestial sphere from east to west.The rates of rotation and revolution are functions of a planet's mass and orbital position. For example, the mass of Jupiter is approximately 317.5 times Earth's mass and the rotation time (the time for Jupiter to revolve once about its axis) is approximately nine hours.Earth takes approximately 365.25 days to complete one revolution around the Sun in a slightly elliptical orbit with the Sun at one focal point of the ellipse. Ranging between the extremes of perihelion (closest approach) in January and aphelion (most distant orbital position) in July, Earth's orbital distance from the Sun ranges from approximately 91.5 to approximately 94 million miles (147-151 million km), respectively. Although these distances seem counterintuitive to residents of the Northern Hemisphere who experience summer in July and winter in January the seasons are not nearly as greatly affected by distance as they are by changes in solar illumination caused by the fact that Earth's polar axis is inclined 23.5 degrees from the perpendicular to the ecliptic (the plane of the solar system through or near which most of the planet's orbits travel) and because the Earth exhibits parallelism (currently toward Polaris, the North Star) as it revolves about the Sun.At the extreme of the solar system, Pluto, usually the most distant planet (i.e., at certain times Neptune's orbit actually extends farther than Pluto's orbit) takes approximately 247 Earth years (the time it takes the Earth to revolve about the Sun) to complete one orbital revolution about the Sun.Rotation, revolution, polar tilt, parallelism, and Earth's oblate spheroid shape combine to produce an unequal distribution of solar energy, the changing of seasons, the changing lengths of day and night, and influence the circulation of the atmosphere and oceans.In addition to Earth's rotation about the Sun, the solar system is both moving with the Milky Way galaxy and revolving around the galactic core.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/seasons<TEXT>Seasons, which generally coincide with annual changes in weather patterns, are most pronounced in temperate zones. These zones extend from 23.5� north (and south) latitude to 66.5� north (and south) latitude. Within these latitudes, nature generally exhibits four seasons; spring, summer, autumn (or fall) and winter. Each season is characterized by differences in temperature, amounts of precipitation, and the length of daylight.Seasonal observations have been noted in the earliest known written records of history. In fact, seasonal changes have affected the course of history in the outcomes of battles or movements of peoples in search of longer growing seasons has often been greatly influenced by seasonal changes. Spring comes from an Old English word meaning to rise; summer originated as a Sanskrit word meaning half year or season. Autumn comes originally from an Etruscan word for maturing. Winter comes from an Old English word meaning wet or water. The equatorial regions or torrid zones have no noticeable seasonal changes and one generally finds only a wet season and a dry season in these zones. In the polar regions the seasons are closely related to the amount of sunlight received, resulting in a light season and a dark season.Seasons are tied to the apparent movements of the Sun and stars across the celestial sphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, spring begins at the vernal equinox (around March 21) when sunlight is directly incident on the equator with equal distribution of light to the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Summer begins at the summer solstice (approximately June 21) when the Sun is at its apparent maximum declination. Autumn begins at the autumnal equinox around September 23, and winter at the winter solstice (minimum declination in the Northern Hemisphere) that occurs approximately December 21. Because every fourth year is a leap year and February then has 29 days, the dates of these seasonal starting points change slightly. In the Southern Hemisphere, the seasons are reversed with spring beginning in September, summer in December, fall in March, and winter in June. Seasons in the Southern Hemisphere are generally milder due to the moderating presence of larger amounts of ocean surface as compared to the Northern Hemisphere.Changes in the seasons are caused by Earth's movement around the Sun. Because Earth orbits the Sun at varying distances, many people assume that the seasons result from the changes in the Earth-Sun distance. This belief is incorrect. In fact, Earth is actually closer to the Sun in January compared to June by approximately three million miles.Earth makes one complete revolution about the Sun each year. The major reason that the seasons occur is that the axis of Earth's rotation is tilted with respect to the plane of its orbit. This tilt, called the obliquity of Earth's axis, is 23.5 degrees from a line drawn perpendicular to the plane of Earth's orbit. As Earth orbits the Sun, there are times of the year when the North Pole is alternately tilted toward the Sun (during northern hemispheric summer) or tilted away from the Sun (during northern hemispheric winter). At other times, the axis is generally perpendicular to the incoming Sun's rays. During summer, two effects contribute to produce warmer weather. First, the Sun's rays fall more directly on Earth's surface and this results in a stronger heating effect. The second reason for the seasonal temperature differences results from the differences in the amount of daylight hours versus nighttime hours. The Sun's rays warm Earth during daylight hours; Earth cools at night by re-radiating heat back into space. This is the major reason for the warmer days of summer and cooler days of winter. The orientation of Earth's axis during summer results in longer periods of daylight and shorter periods of darkness at this time of year. At the mid-northerly latitudes, summer days have about 16 hours of warming daylight and only eight hours of cooling nights. During mid-winter the pattern is reversed, resulting in longer nights and shorter days. To demonstrate that it is the daylight versus darkness ratio that produces climates that make growing seasons possible, one should note that even in regions only 30� from the poles one finds plants such as wheat, corn, and potatoes growing. In these regions the Sun is never very high in the sky but because of the orientation of Earth's axis, the Sun remains above the horizon for periods for over 20 hours a day from late spring to late summer.Astronomers have assigned names to the dates at which the official seasons begin. When the axis of Earth is perpendicular to the incoming Sun's rays in spring the Sun stands directly over the equator at noon. As a result, daylight hours equal nighttime hours everywhere on Earth. This gives rise to the name given to this date, the vernal equinox. Vernal refers to spring and the word equinox means equal night. On the first day of fall, the autumnal equinox also produces 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness everywhere on Earth.The name given for the first day of summer results from the observation that as the days get longer during the spring, the Sun's height over its noon horizon increases until it reaches June 21. Then on successive days, it dips lower in the sky as Earth moves toward the autumn and winter seasons. This gives rise to the name for that date, the summer solstice, because it is as though the Sun "stands still" in its noon height above the horizon. The winter solstice is likewise named because on December 21 the Sun reaches the lowest noon time height and appears to "stand still" on that date as well.In the past, early humans celebrated the changes in the seasons on some of these cardinal dates. The vernal equinox was a day of celebration for the early Celtic tribes in ancient Britain, France, and Ireland. Other northern European tribes also marked the return of warmer weather on this date. Even the winter solstice was a time to celebrate, as it marked the lengthening days that would lead to spring. The ancient Romans celebrated the Feast of Saturnalia on the winter solstice. And even though there are no historical records to support the choice of a late December date for the birth of Christ, Christians in the fourth centuryA.D.chose to celebrate Christmas near the winter solstice.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/celestial-sphere-apparent-motions-sun-moon-planets<TEXT>The celestial sphere is an imaginary projection of the Sun, Moon, planets, stars, and all astronomical bodies upon an imaginary sphere surrounding Earth. The celestial sphere is a useful mapping and tracking remnant of the geocentric theory of the ancient Greek astronomers.Although originally developed as part of the ancient Greek concept of an Earth-centered universe (i.e., a geocentric model of the Universe), the hypothetical celestial sphere provides an important tool to astronomers for fixing the location and plotting movements of celestial objects. The celestial sphere describes an extension of the lines of latitude and longitude, and the plotting of all visible celestial objects on a hypothetical sphere surrounding the earth.The ancient Greek astronomers actually envisioned concentric crystalline spheres, centered around Earth, upon which the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars moved. Although heliocentric (Sun-centered) models of the universe were also proposed by the Greeks, they were disregarded as "counter-intuitive" to the apparent motions of celestial bodies across the sky.Early in the sixteenth century, Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) reasserted the heliocentric theory abandoned by the Ancient Greeks. Although sparking a revolution in astronomy, Copernicus' system was deeply flawed by the fact that the Sun is certainly not the center of the universe, and Copernicus insisted that planetary orbits were circular. Even so, the heliocentric model developed by Copernicus fit the observed data better than the ancient Greek concept. For example, the periodic "backward" motion (retrograde motion) in the sky of the planets Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, and the lack of such motion for Mercury and Venus was more readily explained by the fact that the former planets' orbits were outside of Earth's. Thus, the earth "overtook" them as it circled the Sun. Planetary positions could also be predicted much more accurately using the Copernican model.Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe's (1546-1601) precise observations of movements across the "celestial sphere" allowed German astronomer and mathematician Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) to formulate his laws of planetary motion that correctly described the elliptical orbits of the planets.The modern celestial sphere is an extension of the latitude and longitude coordinate system used to fix terrestrial location. The concepts of latitude and longitude create a grid system for the unique expression of any location on Earth's surface. Latitudes also known as parallels mark and measure distance north or south from the equator. Earth's equator is designated 0� latitude. The north and south geographic poles respectively measure 90� north (N) and 90� south (S) from the equator. The angle of latitude is determined as the angle between a transverse plane cutting through Earth's equator and the right angle (90�) of the polar axis. Longitudes also known as meridians are great circles that run north and south, and converge at the north and south geographic poles.On the celestial sphere, projections of lines of latitude and longitude are transformed into declination and right ascension. A direct extension of Earth's equator at 0� latitude is the celestial equator at 0� declination. Instead of longitude, right ascension is measured in hours. Corresponding to Earth's rotation, right ascension is measured from zero hours to 24 hours around the celestial sphere. Accordingly, one hour represents 15 angular degrees of travel around the 360� celestial sphere.Declination is further divided into arcminutes and arcseconds. In 1� of declination, there are 60 arcminutes (60') and in one arcminute there are 60 arcseconds (60"). Right ascension hours are further subdivided into minutes and seconds of time.On Earth's surface, the designation of 0� longitude is arbitrary, an international convention long held since the days of British sea superiority. It establishes the 0� line of longitude also known as the Prime Meridian as the great circle that passes through the Royal National Observatory in Greenwich, England (United Kingdom). On the celestial sphere, zero hrs (0 h) right ascension is also arbitrarily defined by international convention as the line of right ascension where the ecliptic the apparent movement of the Sun across the celestial sphere established by the plane of the earth's orbit around the Sun intersects the celestial equator at the vernal equinox.For any latitude on Earth's surface, the extended declination line crosses the observer's zenith. The zenith is the highest point on the celestial sphere directly above the observer. By international agreement and customary usage, declinations north of the celestial equator are designated as positive declinations (+) and declinations south of the celestial equator are designated as negative declinations (?) south.Just as every point on Earth can be expressed with a unique set of latitude and longitude coordinates, every object on the celestial sphere can be specified by declination and right ascension coordinates.The polar axis is an imaginary line that extends through the north and south geographic poles. The earth rotates on its axis as it revolves around the Sun. Earth's axis is tilted approximately 23.5 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic (the plane of planetary orbits about the Sun or the apparent path of the Sun across the imaginary celestial sphere). The tilt of the polar axis is principally responsible for variations in solar illumination that result in the cyclic progressions of the seasons. The polar axis also establishes the principal axis about which the celestial sphere rotates. The projection of Earth's geographic poles upon the celestial sphere creates a north celestial pole and a south celestial pole. In the Northern Hemisphere, the star Polaris is currently within approximately one degree (1�) of the north celestial pole and thus, from the Northern Hemisphere, all stars and other celestial objects appear to rotate about Polaris and, depending on the latitude of observation, stars located near Polaris (circumpolar stars) may never "set."For any observer, the angle between the north celestial pole and the terrestrial horizon equals and varies directly with latitude north of the equator. For example, at 30� N latitude an observer views Polaris at +30� declination, at the terrestrial North Pole (90� N), Polaris would be directly overhead (at the zenith) at +90� declination.The celestial meridian is an imaginary arc from the north point on the terrestrial horizon through the north celestial pole and zenith that terminates on the south point of the terrestrial horizon.Regardless of location on Earth, an observer's celestial equator passes through the east and west points of the terrestrial horizon. In the Northern Hemisphere, the celestial equator is displaced southward from the zenith (the point directly over the observer's head) by the number of degrees equal to the observer's latitude.Rotation about the polar axis results in a diurnal cycle of night and day, and causes the apparent motion of the Sun across the imaginary celestial sphere. The earth rotates about the polar axis at approximately 15 angular degrees per hour and makes a complete rotation in 23.9 hours. This corresponds to the apparent rotation of the celestial sphere. Because the earth rotates eastward (from west to east), objects on the celestial sphere usually move along paths from east to west (i.e., the Sun "rises" in the east and "sets" in the west). One complete rotation of the celestial sphere comprises a diurnal cycle.As the earth rotates on its polar axis, it makes a slightly elliptical orbital revolution about the Sun in 365.26 days. Earth's revolution about the Sun also corresponds to the cyclic and seasonal changes of observable stars and constellations on the celestial sphere. Although stars grouped in traditional constellations have no proximate spatial relationship to one another (i.e., they may be billions of light years apart) that do have an apparent relationship as a two-dimensional pattern of stars on the celestial sphere. Accordingly, in the modern sense, constellations establish regional location of stars on the celestial sphere.A tropical year (i.e., a year of cyclic seasonal change), equals approximately 365.24 mean solar days. During this time, the Sun appears to travel completely around the celestial sphere on the ecliptic and return to the vernal equinox. In contrast, one orbital revolution of Earth about the Sun returns the Sun to the same backdrop of stars and is measured as a sidereal year. On the celestial sphere, a sidereal day is defined as the time it takes for the vernal equinox starting from an observer's celestial median to rotate around with the celestial sphere and recross that same celestial median. The sidereal day is due to Earth's rotational period. Because of precession, a sidereal year is approximately 20 minutes and 24 seconds longer than a tropical year. Although the sidereal year more accurately measures the time it takes Earth to completely orbit the Sun, the use of the sidereal year would eventually cause large errors in calendars with regard to seasonal changes. For this reason the tropical year is the basis for modern Western calendar systems.Seasons are tied to the apparent movements of the Sun and stars across the celestial sphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, summer begins at the summer solstice (approximately June 21) when the Sun is reaches its apparent maximum declination. Winter begins at the winter solstice (approximately December 21) when the Sun's highest point during the day is its minimum maximum daily declination. The changes result from a changing orientation of Earth's polar axis to the Sun that result in a change in the Sun's apparent declination. The vernal and autumnal equinox are denoted as the points where the celestial equator intersects the ecliptic.The location of sunrise on the eastern horizon, and sunset on the western horizon also varies between a northern most maximum at the summer solstice to a southernmost maximum at the winter solstice. Only at the vernal and autumnal equinox does the Sun rise at a point due east or set at a point due west on the terrestrial horizon.During the year, the moon and planets appear to move in a restricted region of the celestial sphere termed the zodiac. The zodiac is a region extending outward approximately 8� from each side of the ecliptic (the apparent path of the Sun on the celestial sphere). The modern celestial sphere is divided into twelve traditional zodiacal constellation patterns (corresponding to the pseudoscientific astrological zodiacal signs) through which the Sun appears to travel by successive eastwards displacements throughout the year.During revolution about the Sun, the earth's polar axis exhibits parallelism to Polaris (also known as the North Star). Although observing parallelism, the orientation of Earth's polar axis exhibits precession a circular wobbling exhibited by gyroscopes that results in a 28,000-year-long precessional cycle. Currently, Earth's polar axis points roughly in the direction of Polaris (the North Star). As a result of precession, over the next 11,000 years, Earth's axis will precess or wobble so that it assumes an orientation toward the star Vega.Precession causes an objects celestial coordinates to change. As a result, celestial coordinates are usually accompanied by a date for which the coordinates are valid.Corresponding to Earth's rotation, the celestial sphere rotates through 1� in about four minutes. Because of this, sunrise, sunset, moonrise, and moonset all take approximately two minutes because both the Sun and Moon have the same apparent size on the celestial sphere (about 0.5�). The Sun is, of course, much larger, but the Moon is much closer. If measured at the same time of day, the Sun appears to be displaced eastward on the star field of the celestial sphere by approximately 1� per day. Because of this apparent displacement, the stars appear to "rise" approximately four minutes earlier each evening and set four minutes later each morning. Alternatively, the Sun appears to "rise" four minutes earlier each day and "set" four minutes earlier each day. A change of approximately four minutes a day corresponds to a 24-hour cycle of "rising" and "setting" times that comprise an annual cycle.In contrast, if measured at the same time each day, the Moon appears to be displaced approximately 13� eastward on the celestial sphere per day and therefore "rises" and "sets" almost one hour earlier each day.Because the earth is revolving about the Sun, the displacement of the earth along it's orbital path causes the time it takes to complete a cycle of lunar phases a synodic month and return the Sun, Earth, and Moon to the same starting alignment to be slightly longer than the sidereal month. The synodic month is approximately 29.5 days.Earth rotates about its axis at approximately 15 angular degrees per hour. Rotation dictates the length of the diurnal cycle (i.e., the day/night cycle), and creates "time zones" with differing local noons. Local noon occurs when the Sun is at the highest point during its daily skyward arch from east to west (i.e., when the Sun is at its zenith on the celestial meridian). With regard to the solar meridian, the Sun's location (and reference to local noon) is described in terms of being ante meridian (am) east of the celestial meridian or post meridian (pm) located west of the celestial meridian.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/solar-illumination-seasonal-diurnal-patterns<TEXT>Earth rotates about its polar axis as it revolves around the Sun. Earth's polar axis is tilted 23.5� to the orbital plane (ecliptic plane). Combinations of rotation, revolution, and tilt of the polar axis result in differential illumination and changing illumination patterns on Earth. These changing patterns of illumination result in differential heating of Earth's surface that, in turn, creates seasonal climatic and weather patterns.Earth's rotation results in cycles of daylight and darkness. One daylight and night cycle constitutes a diurnal cycle. Daylight and darkness are separated by a terminator a shadowy zone of twilight. Earth's rate of rotation approximately 24 hours fixes the time of the overall cycle (i.e., the length of a day). However, the number of hours of daylight and darkness within each day varies depending upon latitude and season (i.e., Earth's location in its elliptical orbital path about the Sun).On Earth's surface, a circle of illumination describes a latitude that defines an extreme boundary of perpetual daylight or perpetual darkness. Tropics are latitudes that mark the farthest northward and farthest southward line of latitude where the solar zenith (the highest angle the Sun reaches in the sky during the day) corresponds to the local zenith (the point directly above the observer). At zenith, the Sun provides the most direct (most intense) illumination. Patterns of illumination and the apparent motion of the Sun on the hypothetical celestial sphere establish several key latitudes. The North Pole is located at 90� North latitude; the Arctic Circle defines an area from 66.5 N to the North Pole; the Tropic of Cancer defines an area from the Equator to 23.5 N; the Tropic of Capricorn defines an area from the equator to 23.5 S; the Antarctic Circle defines an area from 66.5 S to the South Pole.There are seasonal differences in the amount and directness of daylight (e.g., the first day of summer always has the longest period of daylight, and the first day of winter the least amount of daylight). With regard to the Northern Hemisphere, at winter solstice (approximately December 21), Earth's North Pole is pointed away from the Sun, and sunlight falls more directly on the Southern Hemisphere. At the summer solstice (approximately June 21), Earth's North Pole is tilted toward the Sun, and sunlight falls more directly on the Northern Hemisphere. At the intervening vernal and autumnal equinoxes, both the North and South Pole are oriented so that they have the same angular relationship to the Sun and, therefore, receive equal illumination. In the Southern Hemisphere, the winter and summer solstices are exchanged so that the solstice that marks the first day of winter in the Northern Hemisphere marks the first day of summer in the Southern Hemisphere.At autumnal equinox (approximately September 21), there is uniform illumination of Earth's surface (i.e., 12 hrs of daylight everywhere except exactly at the poles which are both illuminated). At winter solstice (approximately September 21), there is perpetual sunlight within the Antarctic Circle (i.e., the Antarctic circle is fully illuminated). At vernal equinox (approximately March 21), the illumination patterns return to the state of the autumnal equinox. At vernal equinox, there is uniform illumination of Earth's surface (i.e., 12 hrs of daylight everywhere except exactly at the poles which are both illuminated). At summer solstice (approximately June 21), there is perpetual sunlight within the Arctic Circle (i.e., the Arctic Circle is fully illuminated).The illumination patterns in the polar regions within the Arctic Circle and Antarctic Circle are dynamic and inverse. As the extent of perpetual illumination (perpetual daylight) increases to the maximum extent specified by the latitude of each circle the extent of perpetual darkness increases within the other polar circle. For example, at winter solstice, there is no illumination within the Arctic circle (i.e., perpetual night within the area 66.5� N to the North Pole). Conversely, the Antarctic Circle experiences complete daylight (i.e., perpetual daylight within the area 66.5� S to the North Pole.). As Earth's axial tilt and revolution about the Sun continue to produce changes in polar axial orientation that result in a progression to the vernal equinox, the circle of perpetual darkness decreases in extent round the North Pole as the circle of perpetual daylight decreases around the South pole. At equinox, both polar regions receive the same illumination.At the Equator, the Sun is directly overhead at local noon at both the vernal and autumnal equinox. The Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn denote latitudes where the Sun is directly overhead at local noon at a solstice. Along the Tropic of Cancer, the Sun is directly overhead at local noon at the June 21 solstice (the Northern Hemisphere's summer solstice and the Southern Hemisphere's winter solstice). Along the Tropic of Capricorn, the Sun is directly overhead at local noon at the December 21 solstice.Precession of Earth's polar axis also results in a longterm precession of seasonal patterns.Although the most dramatic changes in illumination occur within the polar regions, the differences in daylight hours affecting the amount of solar energy or solar insolation received cause the greatest climatic variations in the middle latitude temperate regions. The polar and equatorial regions exhibit seasonal patterns, but these are much more uniform (i.e., either consistently cold in the polar regions or consistently hot in the near equatorial tropical regions) than the wild temperature swings found in temperate climates.Differences in illumination are a more powerful factor in determining climatic seasonal variations than Earth's distance from the Sun. Because Earth's orbit is only slightly elliptical, the variation from the closest approach at perihelion (approximately January 3) to the farthest Earth orbital position at aphelion six months later (varies less than 3%). Because the majority of tropospheric heating occurs via conduction of heat from the surface, differing amounts of sunlight (differential levels of solar insolation) result in differential temperatures in Earth's troposphere that then drive convective currents and establish low and high pressure areas of convergence and divergence.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://www.enotes.com/earth-science/global-warming<TEXT>World of Earth Science | Global WarmingGlobal warming, as used in the popular context, is a scientifically controversial phenomenon that attributes an increase in the average annual surface temperature of Earth to increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other gases. Global warming describes only one of several components involved in climate change and specifically refers to a warming of Earth's surface outside of the range of normal fluctuations that have occurred throughout Earth's history.Climate describes the long-term meteorological conditions or average weather for a region. Throughout Earth's history there have been dramatic and cyclic changes in climatic weather patterns corresponding to cycles of glacial advance and retreat that occur on the scale of 100,000 years. Within these larger cycles are shorter duration warming and cooling trends that last from 20,000 to 40,000 years. Scientists estimate that approximately 10,000 years have elapsed since the end of the last ice age, and examination of physical and biological processes establishes that since the end of the last ice age there have been fluctuating periods of global warming and cooling.Measurements made of weather and climate trends during the last decades of the twentieth century raised concern that global temperatures are rising not in response to natural cyclic fluctuations, but rather in response to increasing concentrations of atmospheric gases that are critical to the natural and life-enabling greenhouse effect (infrared re-radiation, mostly from water vapor and clouds, that warms the earth's surface).Observations collected over the last century indicate that the average land surface temperature increased by 0.8-1.0�F (0.45-0.6�C). The effects of temperature increase, however, cannot be fully isolated and many meteorological models suggest that such increases temperatures also result in increased precipitation and rising sea levels.Measurements and estimates of global precipitation indicate that precipitation over the world's landmasses has increased by approximately 1% during the twentieth century. Further, as predicted by many global warming models, the increases in precipitation were not uniform. High latitude regions tended to experience greater increases in precipitation while precipitation declined in tropical areas.Measurements and estimates of sea level show increases of 6-8 in (15-20 cm) during the twentieth century. Geologists and meteorologists estimate that approximately 25% of the sea level rise resulted from the melting of mountain glaciers. The remainder of the rise can be accounted for by the expansion of ocean water in response to higher atmospheric temperatures.Many scientists express concern that the measured increases in global temperature are not natural cyclic fluctuations, but rather reflect human alteration of the natural phenomena known as the greenhouse effect by increasing concentrations of greenhouse-related atmospheric gases. Estimates of atmospheric greenhouse gases prior to the nineteenth century (extrapolated from measurements involving ice cores) indicate that of the last few million years the concentration of greenhouse gases remained relatively unchanged prior to the European and American industrial revolutions. During the last two centuries, however, increased emissions from internal combustion engines and the use of certain chemicals have measurably increased concentrations of greenhouse gases that might result in an abnormal amount of global warming.Although most greenhouse gases occur naturally, the evolution of an industrial civilization has significantly increased levels of these naturally occurring gases. In addition, new gases have been put into the atmosphere that potentiate (i.e., increase) the greenhouse effect. Important greenhouse gases in the modern Earth atmosphere include water vapor and carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides, ozone, halogens (bromine, chlorine, and fluorine), halocarbons, and other trace gases.The sources of the greenhouse gases are both natural and man-made. For example, ozone is a naturally occurring greenhouse gas found in the atmosphere. Ozone is constantly produced and broken down in natural atmospheric processes. In contrast, halocarbons enter the atmosphere primarily as the result of human use of products such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Water vapor and carbon dioxide are natural components of respiration, transpiration, evaporation and decay processes. Carbon dioxide is also a by-product of combustion. Although occurring at lower levels than water vapor or carbon dioxide, methane is also a potent greenhouse gas. Nitrous oxides, enhanced by the use of nitrogen fertilizers, nylon production, and the combustion of organic material, including fossil fuels have also been identified as contributing to strong greenhouse effects.Alterations in the concentrations of greenhouse gases results in a disruption of equilibrium processes. Both increased formation and retardation of destruction cause compensatory mechanisms to fail and result in an increased or potentiated greenhouse effect. For example, the amount of water vapor released through evaporation increases directly with increases in the surface temperature of Earth. Within normal limits, increased levels of water vapor are usually controlled by increased warming and precipitation. Likewise, within normal limits, concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane are usually maintained with specified limits by a variety of physical and chemical processes.Measurements made late in the twentieth century showed that since 1800, methane concentrations have doubled and carbon dioxide concentrations measured at he highest values estimated to have existed during the last 160,000 years. In fact, increases in carbon dioxide over the last 200 years were exponential up until 1973 (the rate of increase has since slowed).Although the effects of these increases in global greenhouse gases are debated among scientists, the correlation of the increased levels of greenhouse gases with a measured increase in global temperature during the twentieth century, have strengthened the arguments of models that predict pronounced global warming over the next few centuries. In the alternative, some scientists remain skeptical because the earth has not actually responded to the same extent as predicted by these models. For example, where many models based upon the rate of change of greenhouse gases predicted a global warming of .8�F to 2.5�F (0.44�C to 1.39�C) over the last century, the actual measured increase is significantly less with a mean increase generally measured at .9�F (.5�C) and that this amount of global warming is within the natural variation of global temperatures.One problem in reaching a scientific consensus regarding global warming is that the data used in many models is neither global nor a result of high-reliance systematic scientific measurement (i.e., that it generally neglects oceans and vast uninhabited areas). Other problems involve forming an accurate articulation of the interplay of global surface warming phenomena that include thermal conduction, greenhouse radiation, and convective currents. Most scientists agree, however, that an enhanced greenhouse effect will result in some degree of global warming.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://encarta.msn.com/text_1741502444___0/Astronomy.html (just excerpts)<TEXT>Up to about 3,000 stars are visible at a time from Earth with the unaided eye, far away from city lights, on a clear night. A view at night may also show several planets and perhaps a comet or a meteor shower. Increasingly, human-made light pollution is making the sky less dark, limiting the number of visible astronomical objects. During the daytime the Sun shines brightly. The Moon and bright planets are sometimes visible early or late in the day but are rarely seen at midday.Earth's Relative MotionEarth moves in two basic ways: It turns in place, and it revolves around the Sun. Earth turns around its axis, an imaginary line that runs down its center through its North and South poles. The Moon also revolves around Earth. All of these motions produce day and night, the seasons, the phases of the Moon, and solar and lunar eclipses.Night, Day, and SeasonsEarth is about 12,000 km (about 7,000 mi) in diameter. As it revolves, or moves in a circle, around the Sun, Earth spins on its axis. This spinning movement is called rotation. Earth's axis is tilted 23.5� with respect to the plane of its orbit. Each time Earth rotates on its axis, it goes through one day, a cycle of light and dark. Humans artificially divide the day into 24 hours and then divide the hours into 60 minutes and the minutes into 60 seconds.Earth revolves around the Sun once every year, or 365.25 days (most people use a 365-day calendar and take care of the extra 0.25 day by adding a day to the calendar every four years, creating a leap year). The orbit of Earth is almost, but not quite, a circle, so Earth is sometimes a little closer to the Sun than at other times. If Earth were upright as it revolved around the Sun, each point on Earth would have exactly 12 hours of light and 12 hours of dark each day. Because Earth is tilted, however, the northern hemisphere sometimes points toward the Sun and sometimes points away from the Sun. This tilt is responsible for the seasons. When the northern hemisphere points toward the Sun, the northernmost regions of Earth see the Sun 24 hours a day. The whole northern hemisphere gets more sunlight and gets it at a more direct angle than the southern hemisphere does during this period, which lasts for half of the year. The second half of this period, when the northern hemisphere points most directly at the Sun, is the northern hemisphere's summer, which corresponds to winter in the southern hemisphere. During the other half of the year, the southern hemisphere points more directly toward the Sun, so it is spring and summer in the southern hemisphere and fall and winter in the northern hemisphere.Phases of the MoonOne revolution of the Moon around Earth takes a little over 27 days 7 hours. The Moon rotates on its axis in this same period of time, so the same face of the Moon is always presented to Earth. Over a period a little longer than 29 days 12 hours, the Moon goes through a series of phases, in which the amount of the lighted half of the Moon we see from Earth changes. These phases are caused by the changing angle of sunlight hitting the Moon. (The period of phases is longer than the period of revolution of the Moon, because the motion of Earth around the Sun changes the angle at which the Sun's light hits the Moon from night to night.)The Moon's orbit around Earth is tilted 5� from the plane of Earth's orbit. Because of this tilt, when the Moon is at the point in its orbit when it is between Earth and the Sun, the Moon is usually a little above or below the Sun. At that time, the Sun lights the side of the Moon facing away from Earth, and the side of the Moon facing toward Earth is dark. This point in the Moon's orbit corresponds to a phase of the Moon called the new moon. A quarter moon occurs when the Moon is at right angles to the line formed by the Sun and Earth. The Sun lights the side of the Moon closest to it, and half of that side is visible from Earth, forming a bright half-circle. When the Moon is on the opposite side of Earth from the Sun, the face of the Moon visible from Earth is lit, showing the full moon in the sky.Because of the tilt of the Moon's orbit, the Moon usually passes above or below the Sun at new moon and above or below Earth's shadow at full moon. Sometimes, though, the full moon or new moon crosses the plane of Earth's orbit. By a coincidence of nature, even though the Moon is about 400 times smaller than the Sun, it is also about 400 times closer to Earth than the Sun is, so the Moon and Sun look almost exactly the same size from Earth. If the Moon lines up with the Sun and Earth at new moon (when the Moon is between Earth and the Sun), it blocks the Sun's light from Earth, creating a solar eclipse. If the Moon lines up with Earth and the Sun at the full moon (when Earth is between the Moon and the Sun), Earth's shadow covers the Moon, making a lunar eclipse.A total solar eclipse is visible from only a small region of Earth. During a solar eclipse, the complete shadow of the Moon that falls on Earth is only about 160 km (about 100 mi) wide. As Earth, the Sun, and the Moon move, however, the Moon's shadow sweeps out a path up to 16,000 km (10,000 mi) long. The total eclipse can only be seen from within this path. A total solar eclipse occurs about every 18 months. Off to the sides of the path of a total eclipse, a partial eclipse, in which the Sun is only partly covered, is visible. Partial eclipses are much less dramatic than total eclipses. The Moon's orbit around Earth is slightly elliptical, or egg-shaped. The distance between Earth and the Moon varies slightly as the Moon orbits Earth. When the Moon is farther from Earth than usual, it appears smaller and may not cover the entire Sun during an eclipse. A ring, or annulus, of sunlight remains visible, making an annular eclipse. An annular solar eclipse also occurs about every 18 months. Additional partial solar eclipses are also visible from Earth in between.At a lunar eclipse, the Moon is actually in Earth's shadow. When the Moon is completely in the shadow, the total lunar eclipse is visible from everywhere on the half of Earth from which the Moon is visible at that time. As a result, more people see total lunar eclipses than see total solar eclipses.Planets and Their SatellitesUntil the end of the 18th century, humans knew of five planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn in addition to Earth. When viewed without a telescope, planets appear to be dots of light in the sky. They shine steadily, while stars seem to twinkle. Twinkling results from turbulence in Earth's atmosphere. Stars are so far away that they appear as tiny points of light. A moment of turbulence can change that light for a fraction of a second. Even though they look the same size as stars to unaided human eyes, planets are close enough that they take up more space in the sky than stars do. The disks of planets are big enough to average out variations in light caused by turbulence and therefore do not twinkle.Between 1781 and 1930, astronomers found three more planets Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. This brought the total number of planets in our solar system to nine. However, in 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) the official body that names objects in the solar system reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet. The IAU rulings reduced the number of official planets in the solar system to eight. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, the planets in our solar system are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.Astronomers call the inner planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars the terrestrial planets. Terrestrial (from the Latin word terra, meaning  Earth) planets are Earthlike in that they have solid, rocky surfaces. The next group of planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune is called the Jovian planets, or the giant planets. The word Jovian has the same Latin root as the word Jupiter. Astronomers call these planets the Jovian planets because they resemble Jupiter in that they are giant, massive planets made almost entirely of gas. The mass of Jupiter, for example, is 318 times the mass of Earth. The Jovian planets have no solid surfaces, although they probably have rocky cores several times more massive than Earth. Rings of chunks of ice and rock surround each of the Jovian planets. The rings around Saturn are the most familiar. See also Planetary Science.Pluto is tiny, with a mass about one five-hundredth the mass of Earth. Pluto seems out of place, with its tiny, solid body out beyond the giant planets. Many astronomers believe that Pluto is just one of a group of icy objects in the outer solar system. These objects orbit in a part of the solar system called the Kuiper Belt. In 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet because it had a rounded shape from effects of its own gravity but it was not massive enough to have cleared the region of its orbit of other bodies. Other dwarf planets in the solar system include Eris, an icy body slightly larger than Pluto that also orbits in part of the Kuiper Belt, and Ceres, a rocky body that orbits in the asteroid belt.Most of the planets have moons, or satellites. Earth's Moon has a diameter about one-fourth the diameter of Earth. Mars has two tiny chunks of rock, Phobos and Deimos, each only about 10 km (about 6 mi) across. Jupiter has more than 60 satellites. The largest four, known as the Galilean satellites, are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede is even larger than the planet Mercury. Saturn has more than 50 satellites. Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is also larger than the planet Mercury and is enshrouded by a thick, opaque, smoggy atmosphere. Uranus has nearly 30 known moons, and Neptune has at least 13 moons. Some of the dwarf planets also have satellites. Pluto has three moons; the largest is called Charon. Charon is more than half as big as Pluto. Eris has a small moon named Dysnomia.</TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://encarta.msn.com/text_761567994___0/Climate.html <TEXT>Climate, the long-term effect of the sun's radiation on the rotating earth's varied surface and atmosphere. It can be understood most easily in terms of annual or seasonal averages of temperature and precipitation.Land and sea areas, being so variable, react in many different ways to the atmosphere, which is constantly circulating in a state of dynamic activity. Day-by-day variations in a given area constitute the weather, whereas climate is the long-term synthesis of such variations. Weather is measured by thermometers, rain gauges, barometers, and other instruments, but the study of climate relies on statistics. Today, such statistics are handled efficiently by computers. A simple, long-term summary of weather changes, however, is still not a true picture of climate. To obtain this requires the analysis of daily, monthly, and yearly patterns. Investigation of climate changes over geologic time is the province of paleoclimatology, which requires the tools and methods of geological research. See Meteorology.The word climate comes from the Greek klima, referring to the inclination of the sun. Besides the effects of solar radiation and its variations, however, climate is also influenced by the complex structure and composition of the atmosphere and by the ways in which it and the ocean transport heat. Thus, for any given area on earth, not only the latitude (the sun's inclination) must be considered but also the elevation, terrain, distance from the ocean, relation to mountain systems and lakes, and other such influences. Another consideration is scale: A macroclimate refers to a broad region, a mesoclimate to a small district, and a microclimate to a minute area. A microclimate, for example, can be specified that is good for growing plants underneath large shade trees.Climate has profound effects on vegetation and animal life, including humans. It plays statistically significant roles in many physiological processes, from conception and growth to health and disease. Humans, in turn, can affect climate through the alteration of the earth's surface and the introduction of pollutants and chemicals such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. See Environment.CLIMATIC ZONESClimates are described by agreed-upon codes or by descriptive terms that are somewhat loosely defined but nevertheless useful. On a global scale, climate can be spoken of in terms of zones, or belts, that can be traced between the equator and the pole in each hemisphere. To understand them, the circulation of the upper atmosphere, or stratosphere, must be considered, as well as that of the lower atmosphere, or troposphere, where weather takes place. Upper atmospheric phenomena were little understood until the advent of such advanced technology as rocketry, high-altitude aircraft, and satellites.Ideally, hot air can be thought of as rising by convection along the equator and sinking near the poles. Thus, the equatorial belt tends to be a region of low pressure and calms, interrupted by thunderstorms associated with towering cumulus clouds. Because of the calms, this belt is known as the doldrums. It shifts somewhat north of the equator in the northern summer and south in the southern summer. By contrast, air sinks in the polar regions. This leads to high atmospheric pressure, and dry, icy winds that tend to radiate outward from the poles.Complicating this simplistic picture is the earth's rotation, which deflects the northerly and southerly components of the atmosphere's circulation. Thus, the tropical and polar winds both tend to be easterlies (winds from the east), and two intermediate belts develop in each hemisphere. Around latitude 30� North and South is a zone of high pressure, where the upper air sinks and divides, sending air streams toward the equator. Steady northeast trade winds blow in the northern hemisphere, and southeast trade winds in the southern hemisphere. These high-pressure areas lead to arid areas on the continents but to moist air over the oceans, because of evaporation. If these trade winds meet an island or mainland coast, moist air is pushed up into cooler elevations, and heavy rainfall might occur.Around latitude 50� to 60� North and South is a belt of low pressure characterized by the prevailing westerlies, which are deflected to the southwest in the northern hemisphere and to the northwest in the southern hemisphere. These are relatively mild, moist winds that tend to bring frequent cyclonic precipitation to all elevations along the west-facing side of continents. The precipitation is characterized by polar fronts, where cold air from the polar easterlies drives in under the warm, moist air of the westerlies, which, on cooling, drop their moisture. In winter this is the cause of most snowfall on continents.TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION SCALESTemperature is an important aspect of climate and can be used to grade climatic zones on a scale of five: (1) Tropical, with annual and monthly averages above 20� C (68� F); (2) Subtropical, with 4 to 11 months above 20� C, and the balance between 10� and 20� C (50� to 68� F); (3) Temperate, with 4 to 12 months at 10� to 20� C; (4) Cold, with 1 to 4 months at 10� to 20� C, and the rest cooler; and (5) Polar, with 12 months below 10� C.Within each hemisphere, eight basic climatological zones can also be recognized in terms of precipitation: (1) Equatorial: rain in all seasons; (2) Tropical: summer rain with winters dry; (3) Semiarid Tropical: slight summer rain; (4) Arid: dry in all seasons; (5) Dry Mediterranean: slight winter rain; (6) Mediterranean: winter rain, summers dry; (7) Temperate: precipitation in all seasons; (8) Polar: sparse in all seasons.VEGETATION CLASSIFICATIONBoth of the above meteorological parameters fail to meet the need for a true and universal climatic description. Vegetation, however, offers a useful guide, particularly in special cases, such as the selva, or equatorial rain-forest belt, with hot tropical rain much of the year; the savanna, with warm, strong seasonality; and the tundra, with cold, strong seasonality. It is a particularly helpful system for a person who wants to know the nature of an area and what it is like to live there. Because temperature relates to precipitation in terms of potential evaporation, a classification based on the latter two provides an excellent guide, with four fundamental divisions: hot-dry (arid), cold-dry (polar or glacial), hot-wet (selva), and moderate-warm to cool-humid (temperate). </TEXT></DOC><DOC>http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761567022/global_warming.html<TEXT>Global Warming or Climate Change, measurable increases in the average temperature of Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and landmasses. Scientists believe Earth is currently facing a period of rapid warming brought on by rising levels of heat-trapping gases, known as greenhouse gases, in the atmosphere.Greenhouse gases retain the radiant energy (heat) provided to Earth by the Sun in a process known as the greenhouse effect. Greenhouse gases occur naturally, and without them the planet would be too cold to sustain life as we know it. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700s, however, human activities have added more and more of these gases into the atmosphere. For example, levels of carbon dioxide, a powerful greenhouse gas, have risen by 35 percent since 1750, largely from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. With more greenhouse gases in the mix, the atmosphere acts like a thickening blanket and traps more heat.Earth has warmed and cooled many times since its formation about 4.6 billion years ago. Global climate changes were due to many factors, including massive volcanic eruptions, which increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere; changes in the intensity of energy emitted by the Sun; and variations in Earth's position relative to the Sun, both in its orbit and in the inclination of its spin axis.Variations in Earth's position, known as Milankovitch cycles, combine to produce cyclical changes in the global climate. These cycles are believed to be responsible for the repeated advance and retreat of glaciers and ice sheets during the Pleistocene Epoch (1.8 million to 11,500 years before present), when Earth went through fairly regular cycles of colder glacial periods (also known as ice ages) and warmer interglacial periods. Glacial periods occurred at roughly 100,000-year intervals.An interglacial period began about 10,000 years ago, when the last ice age came to an end. Prior to that ice age, an interglacial period occurred about 125,000 years ago. During interglacial periods, greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane naturally increase in the atmosphere from increased plant and animal life. But since 1750 greenhouse gases have increased dramatically to levels not seen in hundreds of thousands of years, due to the rapid growth of the human population combined with developments in technology and agriculture. Human activities now are a powerful factor influencing Earth's dynamic climate.The ice of the polar regions furnishes clues to the makeup of Earth's ancient atmosphere. Ice cores that scientists have bored from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica provide natural records of both temperature and atmospheric greenhouse gases going back hundreds of thousands of years. Layers in these ice cores created by seasonal snowfall patterns allow scientists to determine the age of the ice in each core. By measuring tiny air bubbles trapped in the ice and properties of the ice itself, scientists can estimate the temperature and amount of greenhouse gases in Earth's past atmosphere at the time each layer formed. Based on this data, scientists know that greenhouse gases have now risen to levels higher than at any time in the last 650,000 years.Greenhouse gases are rising, and temperatures are following. Before the late 1800s, the average surface temperature of Earth was almost 15�C (59�F). Over the past 100 years, the average surface temperature has risen by about 0.7 Celsius degrees (1.3 Fahrenheit degrees), with most of the increase occurring since the 1970s. Scientists have linked even this amount of warming to numerous changes taking place around the world, including melting mountain glaciers and polar ice, rising sea level, more intense and longer droughts, more intense storms, more frequent heat waves, and changes in the life cycles of many plants and animals. Warming has been most dramatic in the Arctic, where temperatures have risen almost twice as much as the global average.Scientists project global warming to continue at a rate that is unprecedented in hundreds of thousands or even millions of years of Earth's history. They predict considerably more warming in the 21st century, depending on the level of future greenhouse gas emissions. For a scenario (possible situation) assuming higher emissions in which emissions continue to increase significantly during the century scientists project further warming of 2.4 to 6.4 Celsius degrees (4.3 to 11.5 Fahrenheit degrees) by the year 2100. For a scenario assuming lower emissions in which emissions grow slowly, peak around the year 2050, and then fall scientists project further warming of 1.1 to 2.9 Celsius degrees (1.9 to 5.2 Fahrenheit degrees) by the year 2100.Melting polar ice and glaciers, as well as warming of the oceans, expands ocean volume and raises sea level, which will eventually flood some coastal regions and even entire islands. Patterns of rainfall are expected to change, with higher latitudes (closer to the poles) projected to receive more rainfall, and subtropical areas (such as the Mediterranean and southern Africa) projected to receive considerably less. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns may damage food crops, disrupting food production in some parts of the world. Plant and animal species will shift their ranges toward the poles or to higher elevations seeking cooler temperatures, and species that cannot do so may become extinct. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere also leads to increased ocean acidity, damaging ocean ecosystems.Human beings face global warming with a huge population at risk. The potential consequences are so great that many of the world's leading scientists and increasingly, politicians, business leaders, and other citizens are calling for international cooperation and immediate action to counteract the problem.The energy that lights and warms Earth comes from the Sun. Short-wave radiation from the Sun, including visible light, penetrates the atmosphere and is absorbed by the surface, warming Earth. Earth's surface, in turn, releases some of this heat as long-wave infrared radiation.Much of this long-wave infrared radiation makes it back out to space, but a portion remains trapped in Earth's atmosphere, held in by certain atmospheric gases, including water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane. Absorbing and reflecting heat radiated by Earth, these gases act somewhat like the glass in a greenhouse, and are thus known as greenhouse gases.Only greenhouse gases, which make up less than 1 percent of the atmosphere, offer the Earth any insulation. All life on Earth relies on the greenhouse effect without it, the average surface temperature of the planet would be about -18�C (0�F) and ice would cover Earth from pole to pole.Greenhouse gases occur naturally in the environment and also result from human activities. By far the most abundant greenhouse gas is water vapor, which reaches the atmosphere through evaporation from oceans, lakes, and rivers. The amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is not directly affected by human activities. Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone all occur naturally in the environment, but they are being produced at record levels by human activities. Other greenhouse gases do not occur naturally at all and are produced only through industrial processes. Human activities also produce airborne particles called aerosols, which offset some of the warming influence of increasing greenhouse gases.Carbon dioxide is the second most abundant greenhouse gas, after water vapor. Carbon dioxide constantly circulates in the environment through a variety of natural processes known as the carbon cycle. It is released into the atmosphere from natural processes such as eruptions of volcanoes; the respiration of animals, which breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide; and the burning or decay of plants and other organic matter. Carbon dioxide leaves the atmosphere when it is absorbed into water, especially the oceans, and by plants, especially trees. Through a process called photosynthesis, plants use the energy of light to convert carbon dioxide and water into simple sugars, which they use as food. In the process, plants store carbon in new tissue and release oxygen as a byproduct.Humans are significantly increasing the amount of carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas), solid wastes, and wood and wood products to heat buildings, drive vehicles, and generate electricity. At the same time, the number of trees available to absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis has been greatly reduced by deforestation, the widespread cutting of trees for lumber or to clear land for agriculture.Human activities are causing carbon dioxide to be released to the atmosphere much faster than Earth's natural processes can remove it. In addition, carbon dioxide can remain in the atmosphere a century or more before nature can dispose of it. Before the Industrial Revolution began in the mid-1700s, there were about 280 molecules of carbon dioxide per million molecules of air (abbreviated as parts per million, or ppm). Concentrations of carbon dioxide have risen since then as industrial production and fossil fuel-based transportation and electricity generation have spread around the world, accelerating in the last 50 years. In 2007 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a major scientific organization, reported that levels of carbon dioxide had risen to a record high of 379 ppm and are increasing an average of 1.9 ppm per year.To stabilize atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, global emissions would need to be cut significantly on the order of 70 to 80 percent. If efforts are not made to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, carbon dioxide is projected to reach concentrations more than double or even triple the level prior to the Industrial Revolution by 2100. In a higher-emissions scenario carbon dioxide is projected to reach 970 ppm by 2100, more than tripling preindustrial concentrations. In a lower-emissions scenario, carbon dioxide is projected to reach 540 ppm by 2100, still almost doubling preindustrial concentrations. (For a description of these two emissions scenarios, see the Introduction: Global Warming in the Future section of this article.)Methane is emitted into the atmosphere during the mining of coal and the production and transport of natural gas and oil. Methane also comes from rotting organic matter in landfills, rice paddies, and wetlands, as well as from certain animals, especially cows, as a byproduct of digestion. Live plants also emit small amounts of methane.Scientists are increasingly concerned about the release of methane and carbon dioxide from melting permafrost, areas of frozen ground in the tundra (Arctic plains) of Alaska, Siberia, and other subpolar regions. Temperatures in the top layer of permafrost have increased, leading to a decrease in the area of seasonally frozen ground. Methane released from these areas as they melt would contribute to further warming and further melting, in what scientists call a feedback process.Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the amount of methane in the atmosphere has more than doubled. Methane traps nearly 30 times more heat than the same amount of carbon dioxide. Compared to carbon dioxide, methane appears in lower concentrations in the atmosphere and remains in the atmosphere for a shorter time. In total, methane contributes about a third as much as carbon dioxide to global warming.Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas that is released primarily by plowing farm soils and burning fossil fuels. Nitrous oxide traps about 300 times more heat than does the same amount of carbon dioxide. The concentration of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere has increased 18 percent over preindustrial levels. Nitrous oxide contributes about a tenth as much as carbon dioxide to global warming.Ozone is both a natural and human-made greenhouse gas. Ozone in the upper atmosphere is known as the ozone layer and shields life on Earth from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation. This ozone is formed by the action of ultraviolet light from the Sun on molecules of ordinary oxygen. Some chemical compounds are known to destroy ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere. This can break down, or deplete, the ozone layer. Depletion of the ozone layer actually causes a slight cooling, offsetting a small part of the warming from greenhouse gases.However, ozone in the lower atmosphere is a component of smog, a severe type of air pollution. Nitrogen oxides and volatile organic gases emitted by automobiles and industrial sources combine to form the ozone in smog. This ozone is a poison that damages vegetation, kills trees, irritates lung tissues, and attacks rubber. It is also a greenhouse gas that contributes about a fourth as much as carbon dioxide to global warming. Unlike the greenhouse gases discussed above, which are well-mixed throughout the atmosphere, ozone in the lower atmosphere tends to be limited to industrialized regions.Manufacturing processes use or generate many synthetic chemicals that are powerful greenhouse gases. Although these gases are produced in relatively small quantities, they trap hundreds to thousands of times more heat in the atmosphere than an equal amount of carbon dioxide does. In addition, their chemical bonds make them exceptionally long-lived in the environment.Human-made greenhouse gases include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), a family of chlorine-containing gases that were widely used in the 20th century as refrigerants, aerosol spray propellants, and cleaning agents. Scientific studies showed that the chlorine released by CFCs into the upper atmosphere destroys the ozone layer. As a result, CFCs are being phased out of production under a 1987 international treaty, the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. CFCs were mostly banned in industrialized nations beginning in 1996 and will be phased out in developing countries after 2010. New chemicals have been developed to replace CFCs, but they are also potent greenhouse gases. The substitutes include hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).Although HCFCs are less damaging to the ozone layer than CFCs, they also contain chlorine and are scheduled to be completely phased out by 2030 under amendments made in 2007 to the Montreal Protocol. Developed countries must end their use of HCFCs by 2020 under the amended protocol.Although HFCs and PFCs do not destroy the ozone layer, they are powerful greenhouse gases. In addition, they last longer in the atmosphere than CFCs, which have an average lifespan of 120 years. PFCs are exceptionally long-lived chemicals they can persist in the atmosphere between 2,600 and 50,000 years, depending on the specific compound. Their accumulation in the atmosphere is therefore essentially irreversible. PFCs are used in the production of aluminum, in the manufacture of semiconductors, and as refrigerants.Another human-made chemical, sulfur hexafluoride, is one of the most potentially destructive greenhouse gases ever produced. This synthetic gas compound has nearly 24,000 times the warming effect of an equal amount of carbon dioxide over a period of 100 years. It is an exceptionally stable gas with an estimated lifespan of 3,200 years once it is released in the atmosphere. Sulfur hexafluoride is used as insulation for high-voltage electrical equipment and in the production and casting of magnesium.Fuel combustion, and to a lesser extent agricultural and industrial processes, produce not only gases but also tiny solid and liquid particles called aerosols that remain suspended in the atmosphere. Although aerosols are not considered greenhouse gases, they do affect global warming in several ways.Diesel engines and some types of biomass burning produce black aerosols such as soot, which absorb the Sun's energy and therefore contribute to warming. Conversely, coal-fired power plants burning high-sulfur coal emit sulfate aerosols, which are light-colored aerosols that reflect incoming solar energy back to space. In this way, they have a cooling effect. Natural aerosols that also have a cooling effect are produced during volcanic eruptions and the evaporation of seawater. Aerosol particles also have an indirect cooling influence by acting as seeds for the condensation of water vapor into cloud masses. In general, the amount of solar energy reflected back to space is greater on cloudy days.Overall, aerosols may roughly offset the net warming influence of non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases, half through their direct cooling effect and half through their indirect cooling effect. However, considerable uncertainty in aerosol processes means that their cooling influence could be much larger or much smaller. Aerosols are one of the least-understood factors in climate change and their effects are still being debated. Scientists are more certain, however, about the net effect of all greenhouse gas and aerosol emissions, which is estimated to be roughly equal to the warming influence of carbon dioxide alone.As early as 1896 scientists suggested that burning fossil fuels might change the composition of the atmosphere and that an increase in global average temperature might result. The first part of this hypothesis was confirmed in 1957, when researchers working in the global research program called the International Geophysical Year sampled the atmosphere from the top of the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa. Their instruments indicated that carbon dioxide concentration was indeed rising. Since then, the composition of the atmosphere has been carefully tracked. The data collected show undeniably that the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are increasing.Measuring warming of the global climate (the long-term average pattern of temperature) is a complex process. Temperatures vary widely all the time and from place to place, and a local warming trend may simply be due to the natural variability of the climate. But using many years of climate observations from around the world, scientists have detected a warming trend beyond such random fluctuations.Records going back to the late 1800s show a warming trend, but these statistics were spotty and untrustworthy. However, since 1957 data have been gathered from more reliable weather stations, located far away from cities, and since 1979 from satellites. These data have provided new, more accurate measurements, especially for the 70 percent of the planetary surface that is ocean water. These more accurate records indicate that a clear surface warming trend exists and that temperatures have risen particularly sharply in the last few decades.Eleven out of the twelve warmest years on record have occurred since 1995, with 2001-2006 all in the top six. Not every place in the world is warming at the same rate, or even warming at all in fact, some parts of the world cooled over the 20th century. For this reason, many scientists use the term climate change rather than global warming. However, taking all of the local measurements together, the world is warming significantly, and many more places are warming than are cooling.While the behavior of the climate system and the processes that cause global warming are well understood and grounded in basic scientific principles, scientists are still working to understand certain details of the climate system and its response to increasing greenhouse gases. Scientific uncertainty is inevitable with a system as complex as Earth's climate. However, advancements in measuring, analyzing, and modeling techniques have helped clarify many uncertainties in recent years.For example, there had been uncertainty regarding why the warming trend stopped for three decades in the middle of the 20th century. Records even showed some cooling before the climb resumed in the 1970s. The lack of warming at mid-century is now attributed largely to the sulfate aerosols in air pollution, which have a cooling effect because they reflect some incoming sunlight back to space. Continued warming has now overcome this effect, in part because pollution control efforts have made the air cleaner.Satellite measurements of atmospheric temperature, which became available around 1980, originally were thought to measure much less warming in the lower region of the atmosphere than surface thermometers. This led to some doubt about the accuracy of the warming detected at the surface. Eventually, other researchers reanalyzed the satellite data using more advanced techniques and concluded that the satellites were detecting warming quite similar to surface measurements. While there is still some uncertainty, scientists examining the satellite data now agree that the record is consistent with a warming world.For many years global warming was portrayed in the media as an issue with two sides, with some scientists arguing that global warming is occurring and others arguing that it is not. However, this portrayal was an oversimplification of the scientific debate. Skeptics of global warming, including some scientists, pointed to lingering scientific uncertainties to question whether global warming is actually occurring. However, there is now undeniable evidence that global temperatures are increasing, based on direct temperature measurements and observations of other impacts such as melting glaciers and polar ice, rising sea level, and changes in the lifecycles of plants and animals. As the scientific evidence on rising global temperature became indisputable, skeptics focused their argument on whether human activities are in fact the cause of global warming. They argued that the observed warming could be caused by natural processes such as changes in the energy emitted by the Sun. However, the Sun's influence has been found to have contributed only slightly to observed warming, particularly since the mid-20th century. In fact, there is overwhelming evidence that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the main cause of the warming.In 1988 the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The panel comprises thousands of the top climate scientists from around the world and releases a report every six years describing the state of scientific knowledge on global warming. The IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report, released in 2007, offered the strongest scientific consensus to date on global warming. The panel concluded that it is very likely (more than 90 percent probability) that human activities are responsible for most of the warming since the mid-20th century; that it is extremely unlikely (less than 5 percent probability) that the warming is due to natural variability; and that it is very likely the warming is not due to natural causes alone. This level of certainty is extremely high, given the complexity of the climate system and of the influence of human activities on the climate.In its 2007 report the IPCC projected temperature increases for several different scenarios, depending on the magnitude of future greenhouse gas emissions. For a moderate scenario in which emissions grow slowly, peak around the year 2050, and then fall the IPCC report projected further warming of 1.1 to 2.9 Celsius degrees (1.9 to 5.2 Fahrenheit degrees) by the year 2100. For a high-emissions scenario in which emissions continue to increase significantly and finally level off at the end of the century the IPCC report projected further warming of 2.4 to 6.4 Celsius degrees (4.3 to 11.5 Fahrenheit degrees) by the year 2100.The IPCC cautioned that even if greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere ceased growing, the climate would continue to warm for an extended period as a result of past emissions, and with more dramatic effects than were observed during the 20th century. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, scientists project severe climate changes.In October 2007 a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences warned that climate models used to project future global warming may have been overly optimistic. The study found that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels had increased 35 percent from 1990 to 2006, a rate of increase far higher than most climate models had assumed. The researchers reported that the average rate of growth in carbon dioxide levels was 1.3 percent during the period from 1990 to 1999, but 3.3 percent from 2000 to 2006. In 2000 an estimated 7 billion metric tons of carbon were released into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels; by 2006 that number had grown to 8.4 billion metric tons, according to the study. Scientists pointed to the unexpectedly rapid melting of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean during the summer of 2007 as evidence that climate models were failing to predict how quickly the climate was changing.Scientists use elaborate computer models of temperature, precipitation patterns, and atmosphere circulation to study global warming. Based on these models, scientists have made many projections about how global warming will affect weather, glacial ice, sea levels, agriculture, wildlife, and human health. Many changes linked to rising temperatures are already being observed.Scientists project that the polar regions of the Northern Hemisphere will heat up more than other areas of the planet, and glaciers and sea ice will shrink as a result. Regions that now experience light winter snows may receive no snow at all. In temperate mountains, snowlines will be higher and snowpacks will melt earlier. Growing seasons will be longer in some areas. Winter and nighttime temperatures will tend to rise more than summer and daytime temperatures. Many of these trends are already beginning to be observed. Arctic temperatures, for example, have increased almost twice as much as the global average over the past 100 years.A warmer world will be generally more humid as a result of more water evaporating from the oceans. A more humid atmosphere can both contribute to and offset further warming. On the one hand, water vapor is a greenhouse gas, and its increased presence would further increase warming. On the other hand, more water vapor in the atmosphere will produce more clouds, which reflect sunlight back into space, thereby slowing the warming process (see Water Cycle). It is uncertain which of these effects will be greater in the future, and scientists factor in both possibilities when projecting temperature increases. This is one of the main reasons that projections include ranges of high and low temperatures for different emissions scenarios.Storms are expected to be more frequent and more intense in a warmer world. Water will also evaporate more rapidly from soil, causing it to dry out faster between rains. Some regions might actually become drier than before. Overall, higher latitudes are projected to receive more rainfall, and subtropical areas are projected to receive less. Shifting patterns of precipitation (both snow and rain) have been observed in many regions since 1900. Significantly wetter conditions have been recorded in the eastern parts of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia. Drier conditions have prevailed in the Sahel region of western Africa, southern Africa, the Mediterranean, and parts of southern Asia. Droughts are projected to become longer and more intense; in fact, this has already been observed since the 1970s, particularly in the tropics and subtropics.Weather patterns are expected to be less predictable and more extreme. Storm tracks are projected to move toward the poles, shifting wind, rainfall, and temperature patterns. Heat waves will continue to become more frequent and intense, a trend already observed. Hurricanes, violent storms that draw their force from warm ocean water, are likely to become more severe. The intensity of hurricanes has already increased since the 1970s.Warming temperatures are already causing significant changes to mountain glaciers around the world, ice sheets in Greenland and the Antarctic, and polar sea ice in the Arctic. From Europe to Africa to Asia to North America, mountain glaciers have receded over the 20th century, and melting is becoming more rapid. The large-scale melting of ice may accelerate the pace of global warming in what is known as a feedback process. Because ice reflects sunlight back out to space, it has a cooling effect. Water and land, which are darker than ice, absorb and retain more heat.Glaciers on Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, have lost 82 percent of their ice since 1912 and are estimated to be gone completely by 2020. Glaciers in the lofty Himalayas of Asia are melting at a rate of 9 to 15 m (30 to 50 ft) per year. Annual runoff from these glaciers feeds major rivers such as the Ganges, Yangtze, and Mekong. Glacier National Park in Montana is projected to have no glaciers left by 2030, and the number of glaciers has already dropped from an estimated 150 in 1850 to 26 in 2007.In the Arctic annual average temperature has increased at almost twice the global rate over the past few decades. The area covered by sea ice during summer has declined by 15 to 20 percent in the last 30 years, and is projected to disappear almost completely late in the 21st century. Many species, including polar bears, seals, and walrus, depend on sea ice for their survival. The rapid loss of Alaskan glaciers represents almost half of the total loss of ice in glaciers worldwide, and makes a significant contribution to observed sea level rise. Melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which could raise sea level by 7 m (23 ft) if it melted completely, is also accelerating. The area that is experiencing at least some melting increased by 16 percent from 1979 to 2002, and scientists estimate that warming of more than a few degrees Celsius could cause widespread and possibly unstoppable melting, leading to significant sea level rise.Fresh water flowing from melting Arctic ice into the North Atlantic Ocean could disrupt ocean circulation patterns, which have a significant influence on the global climate. According to scientific projections, a collapse of ocean circulation patterns is unlikely to occur by 2100. However, scientists do expect there to be a weakening and slowing of the thermohaline circulation, also known as the ocean conveyor belt. In addition, a disruption of surface circulation patterns in the North Atlantic, known collectively as the Gulf Stream, could lead to cooling in Europe.In Antarctica the situation is somewhat different than in the Arctic. The Antarctic Peninsula, the tail of land reaching toward South America, has experienced dramatic warming at a rate several times the global average over the past 50 years. However, other parts of Antarctica have not shown similar trends, with some areas warming and some cooling. Overall, Antarctica is estimated to be warming at about the global average rate. Unlike the Arctic, there has been no clear general trend in sea ice. In the Antarctic Peninsula, however, ten floating ice shelves have lost more than 14,000 sq km (5,400 sq mi) of ice, and probably have not been at such a low level in the past 10,000 years. As in Greenland, scientists estimate that warming of more than a few degrees Celsius could lead to widespread melting of the West Antarctica ice sheet. This melting alone would raise sea level by as much as 5 m (16 ft).As the atmosphere warms, the surface layer of the ocean warms as well, expanding in volume and thus raising sea level. The melting of glaciers and ice sheets, especially around Greenland, further swells the sea. Sea level rose 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 in) during the 20th century. (The range is due to measurement uncertainties and regional variation.) By the end of the 21st century, sea level is projected to rise another 28 to 58 cm (11 to 23 in) if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase significantly. The projection is somewhat less a rise of 19 to 37 cm (8 to 15 in) for a scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions peak around the year 2050 and then decrease. These projections do not incorporate possible large-scale melting of the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets, which could begin in the 21st century with warming of a few degrees Celsius.Rising sea level will complicate life in many island and coastal regions. Storm surges, in which winds locally pile up water and raise the sea, will become more frequent and damaging. Erosion of cliffs, beaches, and dunes will increase. As the sea invades the mouths of rivers, flooding from runoff will also increase upstream.Small island nations such as Tuvalu and Kiribati, where the highest land is only a few meters above sea level, are already experiencing saltwater intrusion, which is making groundwater undrinkable, and increased impacts from typhoons and heavy surf. These nations could literally cease to exist as the rise in sea level continues, and their governments are negotiating with other nations to transplant their populations.Even a modest rise in sea level will have huge impacts on coastal ecosystems. For example, a 50-cm (20-in) rise would submerge about half of the present coastal wetlands of the United States and other low-lying areas such as parts of New Orleans and the Louisiana coast. Much of the Florida Everglades would be lost to the sea. New marshes would eventually form in many places, but not where urban areas and developed landscapes block the way.Damage can be curbed locally in various ways. Coastlines can be armored with dikes, levies, and other barriers to block encroachment of the sea. Alternatively, governments can assist coastal populations in moving to higher ground, although such a process is extremely costly, especially in heavily populated areas. Some extremely low-lying countries would face rising sea level with huge populations at risk. Wealthy countries like The Netherlands may need to spend huge amounts of money to protect their shorelines, while poor countries like Bangladesh may be forced to simply abandon low-lying coastal regions.Global warming of a few degrees may increase agricultural production, but not necessarily in the same places where crops are grown now. Southern Canada, for example, may benefit from more rainfall and a longer growing season. At the same time, the semiarid tropical farmlands in some parts of Africa may become further impoverished. Farming regions such as California's Central Valley that bring in irrigation water from distant mountains may suffer as the winter snowpack, which functions as a natural reservoir, melts before the peak growing months. Crops and woodlands may also be afflicted by more insects and plant diseases. Agricultural areas will need to adapt to changing conditions, such as by shifting the types of crops grown or investing in drought-tolerant or heat-tolerant varieties. Scientists estimate that warming of up to about 3 Celsius degrees (5.4 Fahrenheit degrees) could increase global agricultural potential, but that further warming is likely to decrease this potential.Plants and animals will find it difficult to escape from or adjust to the effects of global warming. Scientists have already observed shifts in the lifecycles of many plants and animals, such as flowers blooming earlier and birds hatching earlier in the spring. Many species have begun shifting where they live or their annual migration patterns due to warmer temperatures.With further warming, animals will tend to migrate toward the poles and up mountainsides toward higher elevations. Plants will also attempt to shift their ranges, seeking new areas as old habitats grow too warm. In many places, however, human development will prevent these shifts. Species that find cities or farmland blocking their way north or south may become extinct. Species living in unique ecosystems, such as those found in polar and mountaintop regions, are especially at risk because migration to new habitats is not possible. For example, polar bears and marine mammals in the Arctic are already threatened by dwindling sea ice but have nowhere farther north to go.Projecting species extinction due to global warming is extremely difficult. Some scientists have estimated that 20 to 50 percent of species could be committed to extinction with 2 to 3 Celsius degrees (3.6 to 5.4 Fahrenheit degrees) of further warming. The rate of warming, not just the magnitude, is extremely important for plants and animals. Some species and even entire ecosystems, such as certain types of forest, may not be able to adjust quickly enough and may disappear.Ocean ecosystems, especially fragile ones like coral reefs, will also be affected by global warming. Warmer ocean temperatures can cause coral to bleach, a state which if prolonged will lead to the death of the coral. Scientists estimate that even 1 Celsius degree (1.8 Fahrenheit degrees) of additional warming could lead to widespread bleaching and death of coral reefs around the world. Also, increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere enters the ocean and increases the acidity of ocean waters. This acidification further stresses ocean ecosystems.In a warmer world, scientists predict that more people will get sick or die from heat stress, due not only to hotter days but more importantly to warmer nights (giving the sufferers less relief). More frequent and intense heat waves will further contribute to this trend. At the same time, there will be some decreases in the number of cold-related deaths. Diseases such as malaria, now found in the tropics and transmitted by mosquitoes and other animal hosts, are projected to widen their range as these animal hosts move into regions formerly too cold for them. Other tropical diseases may spread similarly, including dengue fever, yellow fever, and encephalitis. Scientists also project rising incidence of allergies and respiratory diseases as warmer air grows more charged with pollutants, mold spores, and pollens.Responding to the challenge of controlling global warming will require fundamental changes in energy production, transportation, industry, government policies, and development strategies around the world. These changes take time. The challenge today is managing the impacts that cannot be avoided while taking steps to prevent more severe impacts in the future.Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, also called greenhouse gas mitigation, is a necessary strategy for controlling global warming. There are two major approaches to slowing the buildup of greenhouse gases. One is to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The other is to keep carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere by storing the gas or its carbon component somewhere else, a strategy known as carbon sequestration or carbon capture.One way to keep carbon dioxide emissions from reaching the atmosphere is to preserve and plant more trees. Trees, especially young and fast-growing ones, soak up a great deal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store carbon atoms in new wood. Worldwide, forests are being cleared at an alarming rate, particularly in the tropics. In many areas, there is little regrowth as land loses fertility or is changed to other uses, such as farming or housing developments. In addition, when trees are burned to clear land, they release stored carbon back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Slowing the rate of deforestation and planting new trees can help counteract the buildup of greenhouse gases.Carbon dioxide gas can also be captured directly. Carbon dioxide has traditionally been injected into depleted oil wells to force more oil out of the ground or seafloor. The same process can be used to store carbon dioxide released by a power plant, factory, or any large stationary source. For example, since 1996 this process has been used at a natural gas drilling platform off the coast of Norway. Carbon dioxide brought to the surface with the natural gas is captured, compressed, and then injected into an aquifer deep below the seabed from which it cannot escape. In most cases, the process of carbon capture would also involve transporting the gas in compressed form to suitable locations for underground storage. Deep ocean waters could also absorb a great deal of carbon dioxide, although the environmental effects may be harmful to ocean life. The feasibility and environmental effects of these options are under study by international teams.The total worldwide consumption of fossil fuels is increasing by several percent per year. However, energy use around the world is slowly shifting away from fuels that release a great deal of carbon dioxide toward fuels that release somewhat less of this heat-trapping gas.Wood was the first major source of energy used by humans. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-1700s, coal became the dominant energy source. By the mid-1800s oil had replaced coal in dominance, fueling the internal combustion engines that were eventually used in automobiles. By the 1900s, natural gas began to be used worldwide for heating and lighting. In this progression, combustion of natural gas releases less carbon dioxide than oil, which in turn releases less of the gas than do either coal or wood. However, a reversal of this trend may be seen as reserves of oil are used up. Other fuel sources such as tar sands (also known as oil sands) are beginning to be utilized. Producing oil from tar sands involves extraction and refining processes that release carbon dioxide. In addition, the relative abundance of coal reserves in countries such as China and the United States may lead to a new upswing in the use of coal for generating electricity. Newer technologies for cleaner coal-burning power plants may help offset the effects.Significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions can only be achieved by switching away from fossil-fuel energy sources. Nuclear power plants release no carbon dioxide at all, but nuclear energy is controversial for reasons of safety, security, and the high costs of nuclear waste disposal. Solar power, wind power, and hydrogen fuel cells also emit no greenhouse gases. These energy sources can be practical, low-pollution alternatives to fossil fuels. Other alternatives include fuels made from plants, such as biodiesel (made from used and new vegetable oil) and ethanol (a plant-based gasoline additive). Use of these fuels can help reduce total carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles. The hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), which uses both an electric motor and a gasoline or diesel engine, emits less carbon dioxide than conventional automobiles (see Electric Car). See also World Energy Supply.International cooperation is required for the successful reduction of greenhouse gases. The first international conference addressing the issue was held in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, informally known as the Earth Summit, 150 countries pledged to confront the problem of greenhouse gases by signing the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). To date, more than 180 nations have ratified the UNFCCC, which commits nations to stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would avoid dangerous human interference with the climate. This is to be done so that ecosystems can adapt naturally to global warming, food production is not threatened, and economic development can proceed in a sustainable manner.The nations at the Earth Summit agreed to meet again to translate these good intentions into a binding treaty for emissions reductions. In 1997 in Japan, 160 nations drafted an agreement known as the Kyoto Protocol, an amendment to the UNFCCC. This treaty set mandatory targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Industrialized nations that ratify the treaty are required to cut their emissions by an average of 5 percent below 1990 levels. This reduction is to be achieved no later than 2012, and commitments to start achieving the targets are to begin in 2008. Developing nations are not required to commit to mandatory reductions in emissions. Under the Kyoto rules, industrialized nations are expected to take the first steps because they are responsible for most emissions to date and have more resources to devote to emissions-reduction efforts.The protocol could not go into effect unless industrialized nations accounting for 55 percent of 1990 greenhouse gas emissions ratified it. That requirement was met in November 2004 when Russia approved the treaty, and it went into force in February 2005. By the end of 2006, 166 nations had signed and ratified the treaty. Notable exceptions included the United States and Australia.In 1998 the United States then the world's single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions became a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol. However, in 2001 U.S. president George W. Bush withdrew support for the treaty. He claimed that the treaty's goals for reducing carbon dioxide emissions would be too costly and would harm the U.S. economy. He also claimed the treaty put an unfair burden on industrialized nations. Opposition to the treaty in the United States was spurred by the oil industry, the coal industry, and other enterprises that manufacture or depend on fossil fuels. These opponents claimed that the economic costs to carry out the Kyoto Protocol could be as much as $300 billion, due mainly to higher energy prices. Proponents of the Kyoto Protocol believed the costs would prove more modest $88 billion or less Much of which would be recovered as Americans switched to more efficient appliances, vehicles, and industrial processes.The Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012, is only a first step in addressing greenhouse gas emissions. To stabilize or reduce emissions in the 21st century, much stronger and broader action is required. In part this is because the Kyoto provisions did not take into account the rapid industrialization of countries such as China and India, which are among the developing nations exempted from the protocol's mandatory emissions reductions. However, developing nations are projected to produce half the world's greenhouse gases by 2035. Leaders of these nations argue that emissions controls are a costly hindrance to economic development. In the past, prosperity and pollution have tended to go together, as industrialization has always been a necessary component of an economy's development. Whether or not an economy can grow without increasing greenhouse gas emissions at the same time is a question that will be critical as nations such as China and India continue on the path of industrialization.In 2007 the European Union (EU) took the initiative in coming up with a new international plan to address global warming. At a  green summit held in March, the 27 nations of the EU reached a landmark accord that went above and beyond the Kyoto Protocol in setting targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement set ambitious targets for the EU overall, but goals for individual EU nations and rules of enforcement were to be determined through additional negotiations.In the accord EU leaders agreed to reduce emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or by as much as 30 percent if nations outside the EU joined in the commitments. They also agreed that renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind power, would make up 20 percent of overall EU energy consumption by 2020 (an increase of about 14 percent). The accord also called for a 10 percent increase in the use of plant-derived fuels, such as biodiesel and ethanol. In addition to these targets, EU leaders agreed to work out a plan to promote energy-saving fluorescent light bulbs, following the example of countries such as Australia and Chile that are officially phasing out less-efficient incandescent light bulbs.At a national level, the United States has so far relied on voluntary programs to reduce emissions. For example, the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, product manufacturers, local utilities, and retailers have collaborated to implement the Energy Star program. This program rates appliances for energy use and gives some money back to consumers who buy efficient machines.The U.S. government has also focused on targets for greenhouse gas intensity, which is the ratio of emissions per unit of economic output. For the economy as a whole, greenhouse gas intensity is usually expressed as emissions per dollar of gross domestic product (GDP). Greenhouse gas intensity targets contrast with absolute targets, which limit total emissions (as in the Kyoto Protocol). Greenhouse gas intensity can decline even when total emissions rise. In other words, if the economy grows faster than emissions, greenhouse gas intensity goes down while the total amount of emissions goes up. This has already been the trend in the past few decades in the United States. Emissions intensity has decreased due to improvements in energy efficiency and rapid economic growth in relatively clean sectors, such as information technology and services. However, total U.S. emissions have grown steadily. For example, the emissions intensity of carbon dioxide in the United States decreased by 17 percent from 1990 to 2002, even as total carbon dioxide emissions grew by 18 percent over the same period. This trend of decreasing emissions intensity is expected to continue in the future.In 2007 the U.S. Supreme Court issued a landmark environmental ruling and its first relating to the issue of global warming hat greenhouse gases are air pollutants as defined by the Clean Air Act. The court also ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reevaluate its policy of not regulating carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles. The lawsuit, Massachusetts et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency et al., was filed against the EPA by 12 states and 13 environmental groups that had grown frustrated with the agency's inaction on global warming issues.Apart from the national government, many state and local governments are also working to curb greenhouse gas emissions. In 2005 three major initiatives were announced. First, the government of California committed to return to 1990 levels by 2020, and reduce emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Second, seven Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states established the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a mandatory program to limit emissions from power plants (while allowing emitters to trade allocations). Third, the mayor of Seattle announced the Climate Protection Initiative, committing Seattle to meet the original Kyoo Protocol target for the United States (before it withdrew support for the treaty) of 7 percent reductions below 1990 levels. Since then, hundreds of other city mayors representing about 50 million Americans have committed to this initiative.Individuals, too, can take steps to curb their own emissions. The same choices that reduce other kinds of pollution work against greenhouse gases. Every time a consumer buys an energy-efficient appliance, uses energy-saving light bulbs, adds insulation to a house, recycles materials, chooses to live near work, or commutes by public transportation, he or she is fighting global warming. </TEXT></DOC>
