speaker	textB	 I want to know why it's warmer in the summer and colder in the winter.A	That's because of the sun is in the center and the Earth moves around the sun and the Earth is like at one point in the winter, it's like farther away from the sun // and towards the summer it's closer it's near, towards the sun.B	 //uh huh, uh huh.  I think I get it.  Can you just draw a picture so I'm completely sure? A	 Okay.  The sun's in the middle <draws sun> and the Earth kind of orbits around itB	 uh huhA	 And like say at one - itï¿½s probably more of an ovally type thing <changes orbit> In the winter, er probably this will be winter since it's further away <points to new circle drawn on orbit>,Speaker	 Excuse me students and teachers.  Today we're going to start outdoor recess.   From now on, we're going to be judging the best classes from the entire week in the lunchroom.  If your class behaves very well, you may be given an extra day on Monday for the playground equipment.  Because we have so much equipment, now two classes will be able to use the equipment.  One class will have the new equipment plus the old equipment behind it.  The other class will have the swings with the new equipment next to it.  The baseball diamond will be able to be used <A draws a new sun>, the basketball court will be able to be used, other areas will be able to be used as well.  The only thing that will not be used today of course is our putting green since it is not yet completed. <A draws new offset elliptical orbit, circle with label winter.  The two rooms that have been chosen today for first recess to go on the new equipment and the old equipment are 107 and 103 <A draws in another circle on the orbit, labels one summer>.  And the second recess using our equipment, room 206 using the old equipment and room 204 using the new equipment and swings.  Now we'll have a wonderful first day and many many years of enjoyment on our new playground. <draws in two new circles, labels one spring>  A	 See, that's winter would be like, the Earth orbits around the sun <motions with pen>.  Like summer is the closest to the sun.  Spring is kind of a little further away, and then like Fall <labels Fall> is further away then spring but not as far as winter, and then winter is the furthest.B	 mm hmmA	 So the sun doesn't, like the flashlight and the bulb, it hits summer, the lines like fade in <draws fading lines from sun to summer>, they get there closer, like quickerB	 mm hmmA	 And by the time they get there [winter], it fades and it's a lot colder for winterB	 mm hmmA	 And spring it's kind of between the two and same for fallB	 mm hmm.  Is this something, have you done this already for your class that you know this from?A	 uh, kind of, like from first and second grade I remember the time that Earth orbiting and whatnotB	 mm hmm, okay.  So that makes a lot of sense.  One thing I wanted to ask you though about was, one thing that you might have heard is that at the same time, and you can tell me if you've heard this, when it's summer here, it's actually winter in AustraliaA	 mm hmmB	 Have you heard that before?  So I was wondering if your picture the way you drew it can explain that or if that's a problem for your picture.A	 Umm, I need another picture.B	 So is that a problem for you picture? <hands new paper to her>A	 Yeah, that is.  Um, ok.  There is the sun.  Yeah, I remember that now cause um it's like as the Earth is rotating, as it's orbiting, it's rotating too. I guess I don't understand it.B	 You're saying as the Earth is going around here, it's doing what?A	 It's like spinning, cause it's going like <gestures>, that's how it's day and night tooB	 Spinning like a topA	 YeahB	 OkayA	 So, yeah, I guess I really don't understand it that much...Yeah, I have heard that, cause I was supposed to go to Australia this summer but it was going to be winter when I was going, but their winters are really warmB	 So you're thinking that somehow the spinning, that somehow if you take into account the fact that the Earth is also spinning, that might help to explain why it's summer and winter at different timesA	 I gue- yeah.B	 That's what you were thinking?A	 Kinda, yeahB	 Just to be clear, what was the problem with this picture for the-A	 Because, yeah I rethought that and it looks really stupid because summer is really close but how could you winter on the other side, how could it be winter on the other side if it's really close here, and how could it be really warm if this [winter earth] is really far away.  I don't know.  That looks really dumb to me now.B	 It doesn't look really dumb to me.  A lot of people explain it this way.  Okay, I'm not going to give away answers yet to find this out.  You can find this out in your classA	 Alright.B	 And I have just one last question.  The last question I want to ask is why is it...So this is about changes from summer to winter, summer to winter, but also it's generally warmer in Florida and colder in Alaska.  So why is that?A	 That's because Alaska is like at the very top, it's the furthest from- the sun hits the equator, I guess, and that's why the equator is so warm, and so the top part, so the very top parts and the very bottom parts don't get as much heat as anywhere elseB	 Why is it they don't get as much heat?A	 BecauseB	 Would it help to draw a picture of this too?A	 OkayB	 I just know sometimes it's easier to explain things in picturesA	 Yeah.  <draws sun>  The sun is like, when the Earth <draws orbit> is rotating I guess, it's rotating on that line <draws line> and it's spinning on that line too, so the equator would be like there and the very North part doesn't get as much heat from the orbiting of the sun, because the sun is kind of in the center and it hits the equator, I guess, that's at the top and that's at the bottom so it doesn't get hit with the sun.B	 Which is the top?A	 It's that, and that's the bottom.B	 <uses fists> If this was the sun, and this was the Earth, where would the equator be?A	 It would probably be in the center <points>, right there.B	 I see.  And the North Pole is here? <points at top of fist>A	 The North pole's there, the south pole is there <points> and it doesn't get as much heat from the sun.B	 And why doesn't it get as much heat?A	 Because it's like sticking out from the top.  Because it's not getting hit directly.B	 Uh huh.  A	 It's getting hit less.B	 So it's less directly getting hit, //I see.A	 //RightB	 So here, it's kind of straight on.  Okay, that makes sense.  That was my last question.  You did great.  I know these questions are hard, but that's what I wanted to know is how you think about this stuff.
